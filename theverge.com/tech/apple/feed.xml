    <title>You can now use Waze on CarPlay’s home screen instead of flipping between apps while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing CarPlay Dashboard with Waze showing directions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EO1ZuMtd6WBDDy3fg3DBYbs80=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476259/20201208_Mitchell_Clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlh2tm"&gt;If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/waze-carplay-dashboard-goes-live/"&gt;Waze has started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay’s home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze’s directions showed up on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apple CarPlay with Waze directions on the left half and top right of the screen, and media controls in the bottom left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ovvaa1ZZonqS_DZccSkQ065K3gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153560/IMG_0241.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Waze directions and music controls, all on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cUVvUV"&gt;The company started beta testing the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591151/waze-carplay-split-view-dashboard-apple"&gt;late last month&lt;/a&gt;, but CarPlay Dashboard has been around for Apple Maps users since the launch of iOS 13 (though it’s only been open to third-party developers since iOS 13.4). The integration is a win for driving safety, as the golden rule for car UI is basically “look at and touch the screen as little as you possibly can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwyfBf"&gt;Before this update, if you wanted to change the song that was playing, you’d have to go to the Music app, press the next button, then make your way back to Waze. That could be anywhere from 3 to 6 taps on the screen, depending on if Waze was in the app launcher on the side. That’s a lot, especially if you’re going 70 miles an hour. Now, you can have both Waze, the next turn you need to take, and the music controls on the same screen, and changing the song will only take one tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYiwL"&gt;In keeping with the safety theme, the update also includes lane guidance, a feature that lets you know in advance what lane you should be in for your next turn or freeway exit. This should help reduce those “I have to be four lanes over in a quarter mile” moments that trip me up on occasion. Happy (and safe) driving!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-429" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $129 or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-23" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $199&lt;/a&gt;. If that deal sells out, you can currently get them at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo for $220&lt;/a&gt; or for $234 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724966188075813300" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Watch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2TkUJkurmgX8ZHUE8HnJGYxv-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9693867/akrales_171113_2119_0045.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal itself. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is  $179 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=0d1a72f49279f5c3ff832b7b9721e419&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725327349047065530" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for its normal price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725899747014446199" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have knocked $20 off the pricing of its black model, bringing it down to $209 ($20 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LW3abi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GXmAb3"&gt;A current deal available for the Apple Watch SE is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900256762314827" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm size with GPS for $259&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off) at Best Buy. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900395414293919" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm with GPS is also on sale for $20&lt;/a&gt; off at Best Buy, bringing the price down to $289.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhhPdM"&gt;If you are looking for the GPS and cellular configuration, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900657775317077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the 40mm size for $309&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for the 44mm size (plus cellular) Amazon has select colors on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J5SFGQQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $320 (usually $359) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy this model at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900565456393275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $339&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NRwn2Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The latest high-end model of the Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect the blood oxygen levels in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QdFhyi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 6 review: minute improvements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jwogLj"&gt;If you are looking for the 40mm model, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5W4WXX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the watch on sale for as low as $350. Best Buy also has a sale on the 40mm &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725900844461171213" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series 6, knocking $30 off&lt;/a&gt; its normal retail price of $399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMKKL1"&gt;Amazon has the 44mm size (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5V1YWL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white only&lt;/a&gt;) for $399, which is how much the 40mm size normally costs. If you are looking for more color band options, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725901169577600920" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the 44mm size with GPS also on sale for $399&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-654" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Right now, Amazon and Best Buy have a ton of deals on Apple’s most affordable tablet. You can buy the base model, which includes 32GB of storage and supports WiFi only for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725891876032187286" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPjki"&gt;If you want more storage, you can get the 128GB of storage model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725892081629772202" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on this model are a little rarer, but you can buy the a 64GB iPad Mini in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8VVG4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$394 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2019 &amp;amp; 2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air 2019 review: happy medium","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, this year’s iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430. Or, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958787565478388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model, which is down to $580&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X1XOEB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-766" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800, and bumping up the screen size to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each size supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top spec model going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pickup the 11-inch model at a discounted price, the 128GB model with Wi-Fi is on sale starting at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553825-REG%2Fapple_my252ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$769 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$794 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Google adds Apple Music support to Assistant smart speakers and displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9oQzfYVrJNGvVSNUT53l88Uf8Q=/0x0:5248x3499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470573/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nest Audio smart speaker | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vP0C9F"&gt;Google has announced that Apple Music is now available on smart speakers and displays that use the Google Assistant, including Google’s own line of Nest products, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;new Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;. Owners of Assistant smart speakers or displays will be able to set Apple Music as the default service on the speakers and use their voice to play songs, albums, or playlists from it, much like they can do with Spotify, Pandora, or YouTube Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2e5mu"&gt;This addition broadens the appeal of Assistant smart speakers and displays to a wider market, and it catches Google’s smart speaker line up to Amazon’s, which has supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18141112/apple-music-support-amazon-echo-speakers"&gt;Apple Music through Alexa on Echo smart speakers since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. As with the other services available on Google smart speakers, you can play Apple Music on multiple speakers at the same time for whole home audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEExNB"&gt;With Apple Music on board, the only major services left that aren’t full supported on Google’s smart speakers are Amazon Music and Tidal, both of which are compatible with Echo speakers (which don’t support Google’s YouTube Music service). Apple’s HomePod smart speakers are in a distant last place here, with support for just Apple Music and Pandora at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im2JMI"&gt;Google says that Apple Music support will begin rolling out today, December 7th, 2020, in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple working on a 32-core processor for high-end Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UMnMr0vvSY3kC63vTqZbFdYZmo=/109x0:1276x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469396/Apple_new_m1_chip_11102020_big.jpg.medium_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s M1 processor (pictured) is its first processor designed for the Mac.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8QQhnj"&gt;Apple is working on a new ARM-based processor with as many as 32 high-performance CPU cores that could appear in a Mac in late 2021, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The processor could also appear in a new “half-sized Mac Pro” in 2022.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Alongside it, the company is also reportedly developing CPU designs with up to 16 high-performance cores and four power-efficient cores which are destined for new versions of the MacBook Pro and iMac. The new processors could arrive as early as spring 2021. Future Apple Silicon designs could also feature GPUs with up to 128 dedicated cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwS0KQ"&gt;News of the upcoming processors comes as Apple has just released its first Macs powered by its own chips. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; each used the company’s M1 chip, which features a CPU with four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. However, the company’s more powerful machines like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; continue to use Intel chips. Apple has said it intends to transition its whole Mac lineup onto its own chips over the course of two years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syWrribvqSBgrHzMIcUlEitcSnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150250/chip_cpu__dg71gt6zecya_medium_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Apple’s existing M1 chip comes with 8 CPU cores; 4 high-performance cores, and 4 efficiency cores.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e20bcH"&gt;As well as the increased CPU core count, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that Apple is also working on chips with more GPU cores. While the current M1 chip comes with either seven or eight GPU cores, Apple is currently testing models with 16 and 32-cores, and is working on chips with as many as 128 for late 2021 or 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ri_D7v7DbUra2fv_EO_i4OP97Vk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150244/chip_gpu__bg7771yvjbpu_medium_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 chip has up to eight dedicated GPU cores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2J0hvt"&gt;Although Apple is working on a processor design with 16 high-performance CPU cores, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that it might choose to release it with only eight or 12 cores enabled, depending on how mass production goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjVGRi"&gt;Prior to Apple’s announcement of its switch to ARM-based processors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232441/apple-arm-mac-2020-5nm-processor-12-cores"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on a processor with a CPU featuring eight high-performance cores and four energy-efficient cores. A processor with this exact combination of cores is yet to be officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4A26V"&gt;Considering Apple’s ambitious plans to move its entire Mac lineup onto its own silicon in the next two years, it makes sense that it has more powerful chips in development. Its first ARM-based Macs have impressed thanks to their combination of power-efficiency and performance, but matching the capabilities of its more powerful Intel-based machines like the Mac Pro is likely to be a far bigger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will replace your iPhone 11’s display for free if it has the glitchy touchscreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8PT62YDNXml7OSbonHaanfBhiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68460383/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3xLK2"&gt;If your iPhone 11 isn’t responding to touches, it might be eligible for a free fix from Apple. The company has launched a replacement program for iPhone 11 displays that stop responding to touches “due to an issue with the display module.” Apple says that “a small percentage of iPhone 11 displays” are affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeMZH4"&gt;Devices affected by the issue were manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020, Apple said, meaning not every phone is affected. If you’re seeing the issue on your iPhone 11, you can check to see if your phone is eligible for the program by plugging its serial number into a box on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-11-display-module-replacement-program"&gt;Apple’s website for the replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPTNR6"&gt;If your phone is eligible for replacement, you can find one of Apple’s authorized service providers to help, make an appointment at an Apple retail store, or contact Apple support to arrange for a mail in. And Apple says that affected phones are covered for two years from the day you bought it, so if the issue comes up for you sometime in that two-year window, you’re still eligible for a free replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple developers can now let you share free copies of your in-app purchases with your family  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrPbwH8TGYX2Qt3aYbPktzsIRXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68460226/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJhO3f"&gt;If you’ve ever wished you could share an in-app purchase with your family, you may be in luck. Today, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4zbvn7u9"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that subscriptions and one-time in-app purchases can now be shared among families. If you buy a consumable item, like coins in a game, you’ll still be the only one who can use them, but if you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/suppliesapp/status/1334955683658280962?s=20"&gt;unlock an ad-free or pro version&lt;/a&gt; of an app it could be eligible for the new Family Sharing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNZyX6"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F06%2Fapple-introduces-macos-big-sur-with-a-beautiful-new-design%2F%23mn_p&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F4%2F22154178%2Fapple-family-sharing-allows-subscriptions-in-app-purchases#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced this change back in June&lt;/a&gt; with Big Sur, but it’s finally letting developers flip the switch to allow subscriptions and purchases to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TGvyeg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;App developer PSA: it is now possible to enable Family Sharing for IAPs and subscriptions, but you have to turn that on in App Store Connect. For subscriptions, it's under the duration… &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hj3NBRN3L0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hj3NBRN3L0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Harris (@steveharris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steveharris/status/1334615046090076162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HXhaqh"&gt;Developers will need to flip that switch, though, as allowing Family Sharing of a subscription or purchase &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steveharris/status/1334615046090076162"&gt;is a manual opt-in&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, only one of my subscriptions, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/food_noms/status/1334683219405508614?s=20"&gt;calorie-tracking app FoodNoms&lt;/a&gt;, allows sharing its subscription, but other big names such as &lt;a href="https://blog.ulysses.app/family-sharing/"&gt;writing app Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; have also announced support for the feature. However, it does seem like the functionality is rolling out slowly. I asked my sister if she could access a subscription I had shared, and she couldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crBTtQ"&gt;If you’re the person who buys the subscriptions in the family, It’s easy to check which of them have the option to share by going to &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;, then clicking on your name. From there, tap &lt;strong&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing the Share New Subscriptions toggle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPjn4y0ldlk5BlutxoIWF5G5VYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146161/Share_new_subscriptions_toggle.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBrVb"&gt;At the top of the screen, you’ll see a switch labeled Share New Subscriptions. Setting it to on will automatically give your family members access to any eligible in-app subscriptions that you sign up for. If you’re planning on signing up for any embarrassing subscriptions that you think might get shared with mom and dad, you may want to turn this off for the time being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftboW0"&gt;Beneath that, you’ll see the list of your current subscriptions. Tapping on one will bring you to the Edit Subscription screen, where you’ll see a Share with Family switch if the developer has decided to allow it. Turning it on will give your family access to the subscription just as if they had bought it themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing an Edit Subscription page on iPhone, with the new Share with Family toggle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_i_VpA4YgzRGr4T7PkSX8Lbxb7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146180/Share_with_family_subscription_toggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Share with Family toggle will show up on apps that support sharing. For me, it was off by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="887Sl4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/04/family-sharing-subscriptions-in-app-purchases/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that the process is different for sharing one-time in-app purchases. For example, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WorkingCopyApp/status/1334871247440769024?s=20"&gt;Working Copy’&lt;/a&gt;s Pro version unlock is done through an in-app payment. For a family member to be able to access it, they’ll have to go to the App Store, click on their account button in the upper right corner, go to &lt;strong&gt;Purchased&lt;/strong&gt;, and then select the family member that purchased the unlock. They’ll then have to download the app from that screen. Depending on how the app is set up, they may then need to click the Restore Purchases button. This process is way more involved, so I’d love to see some tweaks to it down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwcujz"&gt;If your favorite app doesn’t support subscription sharing yet, it may be worth checking back in on the Subscription screen from time to time. There are reports of users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1334611244083507210"&gt;getting notifications&lt;/a&gt; when one of their subscriptions becomes eligible for Family Sharing, but I haven’t gotten any yet. Given that I’m currently not able to share my budgeting app subscription with my wife, I’ll certainly be checking the Subscription screen every once in a while to see if my favorite apps are adopting the model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wristcam is a camera for your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuTbS44N7kROPw6hfrzfa3bvias=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451810/WristcamRose_woLogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wristcam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTlcrQ"&gt;A strap for an Apple Watch equipped with front- and rear-facing cameras is finally launching after nearly four years in development. The Wristcam has an 8-megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p video and take stills in 4K resolution and a 2-megapixel camera for selfies. The company says you’ll also be able to use it as a video walkie-talkie with real-time live-streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Zrfb"&gt;Those might be serviceable cameras, but they’re not likely to replace your iPhone camera. The company sent over a sample of images shot by the Wristcam, which are pretty decent, if a bit underwhelming in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4dDftbfwDX0_kSlVCBo3NQRkog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142248/Shot_with_Wristcam___10.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo taken with the new Wristcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDfrgZ_xwQVPAlNyzG3bEmzh4eE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142409/Shot_with_Wristcam___5.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HmGeC8Lm50g8eBr1I6y9kBuwXH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142412/Shot_with_Wristcam___6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wristcam&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8otWd"&gt;Wristcam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13496276/apple-watch-camera-band-cmra-strap-glide"&gt;originally called CMRA&lt;/a&gt;, shows images on the Watch screen but has a separate battery, which the company says can last an entire day. You can take images and video just by pressing a button on the band, and it will sync them to your iPhone automatically when you drop it on its magnetically attached charging cable at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBcC7n"&gt;The device has 8GB of memory for photo and video storage. The camera connects with the Watch via &lt;a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/radio-versions/"&gt;Bluetooth Low Energy&lt;/a&gt; (BLE) and with the iPhone via Bluetooth 4.2, 5.0, and Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/phJf43_XvrqeJn_Pa6VjLGz3_LA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142143/WristcamBlack_woLogo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Glide / Wristcam&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wristcam comes with two cameras and works independently of the iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ff2The"&gt;The Wristcam band weighs 23 grams, about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fblog%2F29063-spreadsheet-makes-sense-of-price-and-weight-of-all-apple-watch-combos%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520Classic%2520Buckle%2520Apple%2520Watch%2Cas%2520much%2520at%2520125%2520grams.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F3%2F22150955%2Fapple-watch-camera-wristcam-crowdfunding#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;half the weight&lt;/a&gt; of the lightest Apple Watch, and comes in interchangeable colors, including noir, blanc, gray, rose, and sage. Both cameras have LEDs that light up when a photo or video is being shot, so it’s clear when the device is in photo-taking mode. It’s controlled by one multifunctional button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXrU6T"&gt;According to CEO Ari Roisman, the Wristcam can take up to 20 seconds to share a photo directly from the Watch over Bluetooth but will sync directly with a connected iPhone. The ability to share photos directly from the Watch won’t be available at launch but in a future update, Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xw4SJDG3cJ2iWZXUQdeAtf2sj08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142272/WristcamFinalHero_woLogo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wristcam&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ljdyEn"&gt;Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is focused on shipping units to customers who supported the original &lt;a href="https://support.getcmra.com/hc/en-us/articles/212770625-What-is-the-CMRA-Pre-order-Campaign-"&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which pre-sold 10,000 units. The lengthy delay stemmed from design challenges, Roisman said, but customers who have stuck with the company should receive their Wristcams by the holidays. Since it’s been four years, the company said it offered refunds to any of the original crowdfunders who wanted their money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVZ5nw"&gt;The Wristcam is taking direct reservations from customers &lt;a href="https://www.wristcam.com/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; for $299. The first direct-to-customer units will ship in March 2021, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAtYRg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developers can now sign up for Apple’s reduced 15 percent App Store cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a group of apps on an iPhone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpqJ8RliLpAJvP1Ksqi_Wb0ASqQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450369/1228782512.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWPPg9"&gt;Apple has opened enrollment in its new small business program that will allow eligible app developers to receive 15 percent more from App Store sales, the company &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says “the vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible” and all developers need to do to qualify is complete the company’s enrollment form &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QG4Pw"&gt;Apple announced the new program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, marking a significant change in how the App Store is structured. Under the new terms of the program, eligible developers making under $1 million per year in App Store sales and in-app purchase revenue are eligible for the reduced commission rate of 15 percent for the following year. Apple typically takes 30 percent of all App Store revenue on digital items as per its longstanding policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpZWkP"&gt;Although Apple has never released specific figures regarding how much developers earn per year or how much the App Store grosses, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no."&gt;analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the App Store is responsible for more than $50 billion in sales in 2019, while analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates about 98 percent of developers are responsible for just 5 percent of that amount and would qualify for the new program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WsDTM"&gt;Here, in Apple’s words, are the basics as outlined by &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;its new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uE8Opq"&gt;Existing developers who made up to 1 million USD in proceeds in 2020 for all their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can qualify for the program and the reduced commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcYOuQ"&gt;If a participating developer surpasses the 1 million USD threshold, the standard commission rate will apply for the remainder of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t7MsLL"&gt;If a developer’s proceeds fall below the 1 million USD threshold in a future calendar year, they can re-qualify for the 15% commission the year after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p7ov6D"&gt;Developers must identify any Associated Developer Accounts to determine proceeds eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0swbGW"&gt;Apple has set a deadline of December 18th, 2020 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET for submitting enrollment, with a January 1st, 2021 start date for when the proceeds adjustment takes effect. The FAQ states that if a developer applies after the deadline, they must wait until 15 days after they are approved to see the reduced commission rates, and approval may not happen until well into spring of next year. If you’re a new developer with no proceeds, you can submit enrollment to the program and see the reduced App Store rate immediately upon approval if your app is then live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlqdsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgkfhV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
