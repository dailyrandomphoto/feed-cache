    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 currently starts at $369 instead of $399.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch to help you achieve your New Year’s fitness goals? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSKChG"&gt;If you still want to go this route, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 in black by $50, bringing the price down to $159. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdJbF1VDYU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same model with the space gray aluminum case and black Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm6hYBluei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver aluminum case with a white Sport Band&lt;/a&gt;, for $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $179 in white and at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $199 in black instead of $229. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryWZk"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped Watch SE with a space gray aluminum case and the midnight Sport Band from &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchRoundup122121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F645876604&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart for $229&lt;/a&gt;. That’s $10 shy of the lowest price we’ve ever seen this model go for. You can also buy the same configuration in select colorways for $249 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1llTisAz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The GPS and LTE versions of this size are discounted at both retailers as well, selling for $299 instead of $329 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1AJ5SW4B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B09G95JSRJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and Best Buy is throwing in an additional month of Apple’s $9.99-a-month fitness service, Apple Fitness Plus, with each purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review Apple Fitness Plus review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebnXzp"&gt;For larger wrists, Walmart is selling the bigger, 44mm, GPS model with the silver aluminum case and blue Sport Band for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F634588522&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269 instead of $309&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy is also selling the same configuration but in different styles for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1UifrrO3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279&lt;/a&gt;, along with the cellular and GPS variants for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm1VZLc9hy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$329 instead of $350&lt;/a&gt;. Like the smaller model, each comes four months of Apple Fitness Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dmq74g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. Right now, Walmart is selling the 40mm, GPS-enabled model for $349 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals1722&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F386345423&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer was also selling the larger, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm version with GPS in red for $299&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since sold out. Instead, you can buy it in an assortment of colorways for around $429 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155142/2092?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatch172022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498743%3Fpreselect%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm7aAnar8H" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. Right now, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model for $369 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the cellular version is selling for $459 instead of $499 in select styles at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF6QF5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDeals&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F969328673&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBoAQG"&gt;If you prefer the larger, 45mm variant with GPS, it’s currently available in select colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $399 instead of $429. The larger, 45mm model with support for GPS and cellular is also going for $509 instead of $529 in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals121721&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-Cellular-45mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F637310631%3Fathbdg%3DL1700&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbDgH"&gt;Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models. However, we are currently seeing a rare sale on the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 with the stainless steel case. Right now, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;45mm version is on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $629 ($120 off), an all-time low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ARKcVr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="hjNY0P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is adding audio running workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image showing three Apple Watches showing screens of the first three Time to Run workouts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQKgZ4tiPeuNw-R8ZustJzR4JJk=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70359412/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_TTR.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time to Run launches January 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1pmVP"&gt;After launching Fitness Plus in December 2020, Apple has continuously added new features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;audio walks with celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and new workout programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;for pregnant and older users&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing a few more additions, with the standout being audio running experiences dubbed Time to Run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tfTox"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, Time to Run can help users “become more consistent and better runners,” and each session focuses on a popular running route in a specific location. The sessions will be led by Fitness Plus trainers Emily Fayette, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Sam Sanchez, and Scott Carvin — they all also coach the service’s treadmill workouts. Apple will also be adding another running coach, Cory Wharton-Malcolm. Each episode will also feature playlists to match the intensity of the run and chosen location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNG6SR"&gt;Time to Run is set to debut on January 10th, with new episodes arriving every Monday. The series will launch with three episodes and locales: London, Brooklyn, and Miami Beach. Users will also be shown photos on the Apple Watch of “notable sights” along the route in each city. Apple says the episodes can be played both on outdoor and indoor runs. It’ll also be available for wheelchair users as Time to Run or Push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPjpUE"&gt;From the description, it sounds very similar to Time to Walk, which are roughly 25–40 minutes walks narrated by a celebrity guest and their curated mini-playlist. Audio or coached runs aren’t unique to Fitness Plus — you’ll also find them in other workout apps, including Aaptiv, Runtastic, Runkeeper, and Peloton. We’ll have to check out a workout for ourselves to see how Time to Run stacks up, though if it’s anything like Time to Walk, it’ll be more about an inclusive experience than hardcore intervals or sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An iPad showing the new Collections feature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2AO77Hqu1b3jAXDHsqyY7mvius=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152330/Apple_fitness_plus_winter_update_collections.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collections are curated workout bundles toward a specific goal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIeq2v"&gt;The service is also adding curated workouts and meditations called Collections. The idea is to pick out a few selections from Fitness Plus’s library of 2,000 studio workouts and guided meditation that focus on a specific plan over a period of several days or weeks. There will be six Collections at launch: 30-Day Core Challenge, Improve Your Posture with Pilates, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses, Run Your First 5K, Wind Down for a Better Bedtime, and Strengthen Your Back, Stretch Your Hips. This is a neat addition, as one of the more annoying things about Fitness Plus since its launch has been limited filtering options. While you can search workouts by trainer, music genre, and time, you have to read each workout description to learn more about what each session is tailored toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="501RBN"&gt;Time to Run and Collections aren’t the only new updates, however. Time to Walk is also getting a third season, with guests like Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Hasan Minhaj, Chris Meloni, Ayo Tometi, Chelsea Handler, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Apple’s Artist Spotlight series, which features entire workouts set to a single musician, will add Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and The Beatles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 iPad Mini with 5G support is $20 off today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad mini 6 (LTE) is selling for $629.98 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIKQDn"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a deal to drop on Apple’s latest iPad Mini, today is your lucky day. Discounts on the LTE- and 5G-ready version of the iPad Mini are rare, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G99C83X?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 64GB model (usually $649.99) for $629.98&lt;/a&gt;. That is a small discount, but for context, it’s actually $1 shy of its best price we’ve seen yet for this model. The tablet, which released in 2021, is equipped with Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, a 12MP rear camera, and USB-C support. It also comes with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in during video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUjtJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cZqZCV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xkoJUi"&gt;We’ve got another Apple deal for you, but this one may help you achieve your fitness goals, if you have some. While we’ve been seeing a lot of deals on the 41mm and 45mm GPS versions, we haven’t seen as many LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 7 sales. That has changed recently, as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFM35F9/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering the bigger 45mm LTE Apple Watch Series 7 selling at $509&lt;/a&gt;. That price applies to a few colorways with aluminum-clad cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XFpDz"&gt;If you want a best-ever price, check out the 45mm GPS and LTE Series 7 watches that have stainless steel cases. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HFGVDS6/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some of those are selling for $629&lt;/a&gt;, which is a whopping $120 discount from their normal $749 price. The Series 7 features an edge-to-edge display, which is larger than its predecessor, as well as IP6X dust resistance. It can track statistics like heart rate, blood oxygen, EKG, and more. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/26269955.4573/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzIyNTMzL2FwcGxlLXdhdGNoLXNlcmllcy03LXJldmlldy1zY3JlZW4td2F0Y2hvcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B0da29cbb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WkMSO7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z78XRP"&gt;Shifting away from great smartwatches to useful and fun smart bulbs, right now, Philips Hue is taking 20 percent off some of its most popular smart light bulbs, strips, and more during its mix-and-match sale that lasts until January 17th. To get the discount, which applies to the total purchase cost, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmX9FIUoZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;choose four items from this list&lt;/a&gt;. The new price will be reflected at checkout and your order will ship for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzxZDt"&gt;As for what the promo includes, there are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYa7ZbyWv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmYbroZ5BP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three packs&lt;/a&gt; of Philips Hue A19 E26 white and color ambiance bulbs, which typically retail for $79.99 and $134.99, respectively. If you need to stock up on several bulbs, you stand to save a lot of money today. Though, understandably, you might not be in a position to put down that much cash. So if you prefer to buy just one kit, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-compatible-Assistant/dp/B07QV9XB87/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of white and color A19 ambiance bulbs for $109.99&lt;/a&gt; (usually $134.99).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYMVOK"&gt;These smart bulbs can pair to your phone via Bluetooth or to your existing setup of Philips Hue bulbs via the Hue Bridge, which uses Zigbee. That latter connectivity allows for the likes of Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa to be able to control them. These bulbs support several color temperature options, adjustable smart timers, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleepbuds are small enough to fit snugly into your ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjNQfrOBCv32C7irpg2-e230IYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175615/akrales_201215_4331_0033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nAwJSC"&gt;If one of your New Year’s resolutions is to get healthier, or practice better self-care, this deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt; may help. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Sleepbuds-II-Technology-clinically/dp/B08FRR6Z1N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $249 earbuds are selling for an all-time low of $199 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmGkKbWpgY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Designed to help you sleep better, these small earbuds silence external sounds and replace them with a combination of relaxing sounds and music. Unlike its predecessor, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inconsistent battery life and abrupt shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;, these are apparently much improved per Barbara Krasnoff’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also comfortable to wear, effective at silencing a range of noises, and you can even them use to set an alarm or to be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtvbaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10965214"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfO4a7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFJKK2T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Essential indoor camera is selling for $78.49&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon, an all-time low price on this smart home device that usually costs $100. It launched last year, and alongside two-way talk capabilities, the Arlo Essential indoor camera offers a privacy shield to cover the lens, a siren, night vision support, a 1080p sensor, and a 130-degree field of view. While we’ve yet to test it for ourselves, our smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy notes Arlo’s cameras tend to be of good quality. However, as you’ll need to pay for the monthly subscription to be able to get the most use out of it, this is more of a must-see deal for those who may already have multiple Arlo cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jO0kyz"&gt;If you’re looking for a standalone camera, there are better, more affordable options on the market. The Blink Mini is one example, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $34.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9pF95d"&gt;Here are some other great deals going on:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U1gbcp"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced Garmin Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; is a great pick that boasts an array of sensors, ranging from a barometric altimeter for elevation to a thermometer, although it lacks a mic or speaker (both are found in the Venu 2 Plus). If those omissions don’t bother you, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smaller-Sized-Smartwatch-Monitoring-010-02429-02/dp/B0911XHHCN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Venu 2 for $349.99 instead of $399.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="52vf6c"&gt;Find your lost items quickly with the Tile Pro Bluetooth Tracker, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2WLRWX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is currently selling for $29.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of its best prices yet, down from $35. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="igxs8I"&gt;If you’re shopping for a budget-friendly streaming stick, Woot is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDeals162022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Ffire-tv-stick-with-alexa-voice-remote-2020-release-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 (usually $39.99) until January 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The device works with older TVs, and you can search for shows and movies to watch using vocal commands with Alexa’s Voice Remote, which is included in the price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s 2021 pay package swelled to $98.7 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Milwaukee Bucks v Utah Jazz" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVk27OuZxdGisEYmpFktIOrti-A=/1714x23:7183x3669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357468/1235869222.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utah Jazz Owners, Dwyane Wade and Ryan Smith sit with the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook during a preseason game between the against the Utah Jazzv and the against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 13, 2021&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Melissa Majchrzak/NBAE via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yyHfuA"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312522003583/d222670ddef14a.htm"&gt;proxy statement filed by Apple on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; revealed exactly how much one can earn after ten years of running the world’s most valuable and most profitable company, and for Tim Cook, that number is $98.7 million. While his base salary stayed at $3 million, an additional $12 million in incentives, $82 million worth of stock awards, and the money spent to cover items like security and private flights — since 2017, Apple doesn’t let its CEO fly commercial — nudged the entire thing closer to the $100 million mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Cumulative total Shareholder Return 2011 to 2021" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeGrV_beZJvv-moOEBW-CBI52yM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23151140/apple_tsr_cook.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312522003583/d222670ddef14a.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to Apple, its total shareholder return “was at the 97th percentile of the companies that were included in the S&amp;amp;P 500 for the entire performance period” from 2018 to 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uE1d3Y"&gt;That’s more than six times his 2020 pay of $14 million, and as noted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/06/tim-cook-2021-compensation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and doesn’t include more than $750 million in shares that vested this year as the final part of a ten-year package Cook received when he took over the company. The terms of that package changed in 2013 when stock performance slipped, which Apple says happened at Cook’s request, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/21/4453490/tim-cook-could-lose-half-his-future-stock-compensation-if-apple"&gt;putting some of the grant at risk if didn’t return enough money to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. And as we noted while recapping a decade of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;Apple under the leadership of Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt;, we all know what happened next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r8afxy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xy8VH0"&gt;In August, when we wrote that decade recap, Apple was still approaching a $2.5 trillion market cap, and in the time since, it has crossed $3 trillion (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;no matter how briefly)&lt;/a&gt;. It hasn’t all been happy times, however. Over the last couple of years, Apple employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22659497/apple-slack-organizing-zoe-schiffer-decoder-interview"&gt;opened up&lt;/a&gt; like never before about issues with its internal culture including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;push to return to the office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;, among many other things. &lt;/p&gt;

Apple notes in its own document that after putting together “base salary, bonuses, commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2021 as our consistently applied compensation measure” to find the pay of its median employee, they received $68,254, creating a compensation ratio of 1,447 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 14 Pro could have a hole-punch camera and hide Face ID under the screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XtOn0HOK_-DLvNsROUueKzaePwE=/0x0:2032x1355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70356798/akrales_210917_4760_0175.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7LIn7"&gt;Rumors for Apple’s upcoming 2022 iPhone refresh are continuing to roll, with Twitter leaker DylanDKT claiming that the iPhone 14 Pro lineup will feature a pill-shaped hole-punch design for its front-facing camera, with the bulk of Apple’s Face ID hardware being placed under the display (instead of an eyesore of a notch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5ptVR"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;corroborates earlier rumors&lt;/a&gt; from well-regarded Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from late last year, which also claimed that the 2022 iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max would be shifting over to a hole-punch cutout for the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u4eRCO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am able to corroborate information regarding a hole punch camera for the pro models of the iPhone 14. Face ID hardware will be placed under the display. As a reassurance to any concerns, the functionality of these sensors have not been negatively affected by this change.&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan (@dylandkt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479110144088686604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qSRig"&gt;Apple made its first major change to the iPhone’s Face ID notch with last year’s iPhone 13 lineup, which featured a slightly smaller notch than the original design that Apple had used since 2017’s iPhone X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U0HIa"&gt;And moving the Face ID array beneath the screen while keeping a cutout does make a lot of sense: Face ID’s IR-based setup would be less impacted by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;haziness and weak colors&lt;/a&gt; that exist for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776271/under-display-selfie-cameras-zte-microsoft-xiaomi"&gt;current under-display front-facing cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and reducing the iPhone 14 Pro’s notch to a smaller cutout would put Apple back on even footing with Android competitors, who have long since left Apple’s oversized notch in the dust with years of diminutive camera cutout designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAjn1j"&gt;That said, it seems that Apple might be looking to the slimmed-down notch as a design differentiator between the pricier iPhone 14 Pro lineup and the standard iPhone 14 models, which are said to be keeping the existing Face ID notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ7634"&gt;Additionally, it seems that Apple’s under-display ambitions will still only extend to the Face ID camera array: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683948/iphone-14-rumor-foldable-fingerprint-48mp-punch-hole"&gt;Kuo’s late 2021 report&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Apple’s long-rumored plans to bring back its Touch ID sensor in the form of an under-display fingerprint scanner won’t happen until 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyY5Xg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479164229567537152"&gt;DylanDKT also claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will be released an updated iPhone SE model in 2022, which will keep the same broad design as the current 2020 SE but add 5G and improved specs. Meanwhile, a foldable iPhone is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1479157616983130113%5C"&gt;still said&lt;/a&gt; to be in the prototyping phase, with Apple reportedly “playing the long game to see how the technology progresses” before it commits to a consumer device — a claim that’s also in line with Kuo’s earlier reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the latest iPad is a great deal at $105</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtgtrNkzrgN8FWwlJFSGgFuSYlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354229/jbareham_170609_1765_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLPJzw"&gt;If you own Apple’s ninth Gen iPad, or the previous-gen iPad Air (pre-USB-C days), this Smart Keyboard is compatible — and selling for just about its lowest price yet at Woot. Normally $150 or so at most other retailers, you can snag this snap-on keyboard that covers your iPad’s screen when it’s not in use &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup010522/https://computers.woot.com/offers/apple-smart-keyboard-for-ipad-charcoal?ref=w_cnt_wp_2_27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $104.99&lt;/a&gt;. This accessory also works with the seventh- and eighth-gen iPads, as well as the 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF2tws"&gt;This is a good price, and it comes with a one-year warranty through Apple. Though, it’s possible that you might want a keyboard for your iPad that offers a trackpad, too. Don’t worry, those exist, and buying one won’t cost you much more than this Smart Keyboard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s $129.99 10.2 Max Plus keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; delivers a solid typing experience, along with protection for every side of your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NUK2QJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bmJov2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXHOuC"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful, port-filled USB-C hub, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B087QZVQJX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s 555 model is $67.99 right now&lt;/a&gt;, down 15 percent from its usual price. This model delivers eight ports, including an HDMI port (up to 4K at 60Hz refresh rate), USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 port (supporting 10Gbps speeds), USB-C PD for passthrough charging, two USB-A ports, 1Gbps ethernet jack, and  microSD and SD card readers. Notably, this USB-C hub can accept 100W of power, passing 85W of it to your laptop while reserving the rest of the power for any accessories you might want to plug into the Anker 555. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbqTla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LB1IVy"&gt;This deal has been popular with new and existing Oculus Quest 2 headset owners: the Elite strap that makes wearing the headset more comfortable is $10 off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $39&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. We saw this deal first pop up right after Christmas, and it’s worth going for if you want a strap that offers more support for your VR marathons (or even just for your quick burst workouts, if that’s your thing). While you’re at it, you may want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this Oculus Quest 2 hard zip-up case&lt;/a&gt; to keep your headset protected while it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1uhJZe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sNyl3w"&gt;When it comes to gaming accessories, opting for a higher-performance piece of kit can make the difference in giving you that slight competitive edge — or it can just make you feel good. Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 controller perfectly encapsulates that. Maybe most of us are not talented enough to really need a pro-level controller, but tinkering with its swappable sticks, directional pads, optional rear paddles, and fine-tuning is just fun. This premium controller feels great, looks great, and you can tailor it to what fits your proclivities. It’s currently on sale for $139.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low price that knocks $40 off MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLQuSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u74zsD"&gt;Extra deals for extra credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I0A8s4"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $39.99 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Luigis-Mansion-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SK4W1VJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is close to the historical low price for a very good first-party Nintendo game starring everyone’s favorite Italian plumber’s brother (aside from me: Antonio). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IFEHFF"&gt;The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas 4 flight stick for PS5, PS4, and PC is $49.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmwzgNK6ei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very affordable way to get into trying out flight sticks without jumping into more elaborate, expensive setups. While it’s built for PlayStation, you can install PC drivers that’ll make it compatible with the likes of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="le6tFV"&gt;If you shoot Fuji’s mirrorless X system, you can pick up the X-T30 on closeout sale at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxt30s.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; for $799 ($100 off). This camera is a little long in the tooth now, but it’s still a very capable model if you don’t need the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653712/fujifilm-gfx50sii-xt30ii-xf33-xf23-announced-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X-T30 II&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306026/fujifilm-xt30-camera-review-fuji-xt3-mirrorless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aaB2gJ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals010622&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;Woot&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt; has an exceptional price on the Apple AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, especially if you like the color pink. You can pick up the space gray colorway for $459.99 ($90 off) or the pink for $399.99 ($149 off). These are new units from Woot, complete with a one-year Apple warranty. &lt;/s&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt;.&lt;/s&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2aVlZ"&gt;Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals available on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting 64GB iPad with Wi-Fi by $30, which remains the steepest discount we’ve seen on the latest model. The same $30 discount also extends to the 256GB model with Wi-Fi, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in the silver colorway for $449&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart in either color&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"10 of the best Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen than its predecessor, along with a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has forfeited its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is, especially now that Apple and other retailers have officially discontinued selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini at Amazon are fairly limited. Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the 64GB model with Wi-Fi in select colorways&lt;/a&gt; for $494.00, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9LPNLG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model with Wi-Fi for $639.&lt;/a&gt; Most other retailers, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107515/1036?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, are selling the 2021 model at $499, its full retail price. Best Buy is also offering 30 percent off select mice, 15 percent off select keyboards, and a handful of other discounts with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase of either Wi-Fi-equipped configuration&lt;/a&gt;. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 41,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Walmart is selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F462727496&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in multiple colorways for $539&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 11 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance at Best Buy in several Wi-Fi-equipped configurations and colors. Right now, the retailer is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi02BD2dZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $809.99&lt;/a&gt; ($90 off), the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi28RDHBK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $989.99&lt;/a&gt; ($110 off), and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjJQICs36o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB variant for $1,104.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Fraggle Rock reboot looks like it will stay true to the original series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUyEv1Id0bbESAfJb4wiFjEHK1k=/0x114:2190x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352534/010522_Fraggle_Rock_Back_Rock_Debut_Big_Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zN4u7t"&gt;Apple released a new trailer for its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; Apple TV Plus reboot on Wednesday (officially titled &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&lt;/em&gt;), and it seems like the new series will be bringing back all of the hallmarks of the original show. The new trailer features charming puppets, a catchy song, and a dumb joke to kick things off that I actually found kind of funny, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H21eTqk9BP8"&gt;watch it all here&lt;/a&gt;. The 13-episode series debuts on January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQNOI4"&gt;Apple TV Plus has become something of a destination for &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2020, the company debuted the first in a series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&lt;/em&gt;, and in May 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;acquired past seasons of the original show&lt;/a&gt;. (Seems like someone over at Apple is a &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; fan. Maybe Tim Cook?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnzBAT"&gt;The new series joins Apple TV Plus’ growing lineup of original shows geared toward children, which also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887382/apple-tv-plus-kids-trailers-content-snoopy-sesame-street-ghostwriter-helpsters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Harriet the Spy,&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;Ghostwriter&lt;/em&gt; reboot, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873176/apple-tv-plus-helpsters-ghostwriter-trailers-childrens-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helpsters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s camera-equipped Nest Hub Max smart display is $40 off </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tH1Yi"&gt;If you’re keeping track of the ludicrous amount of things being announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;at CES this week&lt;/a&gt;, you already know there are plenty of new toys to look forward to coming down the pipeline in 2022. Though, as excited as we are, most of it is going to be &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;costly. We love the idea of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;97-inch TV&lt;/a&gt; as much as the next person, but let’s instead take a look at some great deals on tech we can own today that shouldn’t require a second mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AenlLd"&gt;Starting us off, the Google Nest Hub Max is a sizable 10-inch smart display with a loud speaker and a camera, and you can get it for $189 ($40 off) — just $10 short of its very best price from Black Friday. It’s available in chalk or charcoal colorways at this price from &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00426us.html%3Fsterm%3DX6p2ms0xpxyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkG1LVXx1ykOzY0&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Chalk%2F842552117&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1499418-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00426_us_nest_hub_max_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7sMUfbAL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is similar to the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/4/22865019/google-nest-hub-apple-watch-series-7-wacom-one-airtag-loop-lg-a1-tv-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt; on the smaller seven-inch Nest Hub, though the Max offers better sound quality, more screen real estate for viewing that excellent Google Photos-powered homescreen, and a camera for video calls. It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; you can buy today, especially if you value Google’s software experience and app ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SuM449"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DGxkJf"&gt;Staying in the neighborhood of smart home tech while hopping the fence to Amazon’s walled garden of products, the Ring Floodlight Camera Plus is currently on sale for $149 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1648374-REG%2Fring_b08f6gpqq7_1080p_floodlight_cam_wired.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22866724%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max-xbox-headset-ring-floodlight-camera-plus-elgato-facecam-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The floodlight camera space has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many solid options&lt;/a&gt; and continues to get more competitive with a recent addition from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest&lt;/a&gt;. This camera from Ring is a more affordable counterpart to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera#2RQz7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Floodlight Cam Pro&lt;/a&gt; and features 1080p recording with bright LED lights, night vision, and weather resistance (it’s meant to live outside, of course). At this discounted price of $149, it’s a full $100 cheaper than the higher-end Pro model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91lnlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgVeSG"&gt;Let’s shift to cameras more focused on letting the world see that lovely face of yours. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl7KrsqhbL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the Elgato Facecam for $30 off on its Deal of the Day. This drops the popular streamer cam down to $170, matching its all-time low price. Speaking of matching, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0973DV11T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently matching this deal as well. The Facecam lacks a mic but offers a solid 1080p feed at 60fps with tweakable picture settings on Elgato’s Camera Hub app. It’s good enough to get a nod in our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best webcams you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, and that $30 discount helps alleviate its biggest downside, its price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VPSy8O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730597"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bKhuw5"&gt;Whether you’re streaming games or just enjoying them, good audio is one of the key factors that can give you a competitive edge or immerse you further in an expansive world. A headset is often the best solution, especially if you’re living the apartment life but like to hear every little detail without annoying your roommates or family. The wired Xbox stereo headset is a great option that’s much more affordable compared to wireless alternatives, and the 3.5mm cable gives it a no-fuss handling for Xbox consoles and Windows PCs. This extra-cool special edition released for the Xbox’s 20th anniversary is currently $59.99 ($10 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Stereo-Headset-20th-Anniversary-SE%2F639773287&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This headset matches the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714394/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-controller-headset-design-preorder-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20th anniversary controller launched alongside it&lt;/a&gt; and features translucent sides with green highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di9u3H"&gt;If that styling isn’t your thing, or if you need an even lower price, the standard black version with the same specs and features is just $46.49 (about $14 off) at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-wired-gaming-stereo-headset-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-84004221%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal010522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MD2r9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is celebrating 20 years of Xbox in secret style","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22785059/microsoft-halo-xbox-translucent-controller-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="O8qseB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10962486"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="d5C7LB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860198"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fyi2vm"&gt;More deals, you say? Yes, more deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve recently seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $114.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $15 less than their typical asking price. They’re also &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/619717/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=66025&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A66025&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now, where you can pick them up for $119.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling them for $169.98&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, roughly $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still more than $50 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ri3jYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for $479 in most colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610234-REG%2Fapple_mgyj3am_a_airpods_max_silver.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;reserve them in green at Micro Center for $429.99&lt;/a&gt;, one of their best prices to date, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;
