    <title>Apple will now let you add virtual lasers and confetti to your Clips videos</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0bKlTv"&gt;Apple now lets you add augmented-reality lasers, confetti, and more to your Clips videos, thanks to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fclips-adds-immersive-new-arspaces%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22404413%2Fapple-ar-lidar-clips-video-effects-sparkle-lasers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an update to the short-form video app&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called AR Spaces, will let users with LIDAR-equipped Apple devices (so far, that’s the iPhone 12 Pros and iPad Pros from 2020 or later) add room-filling effects that can interact with walls and floors. (If you watched Apple’s April 20th event, you may have spotted &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M?t=2697"&gt;a brief look at the update&lt;/a&gt; ahead of today’s release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C22qp"&gt;You can get an idea of what this will look like in action with this GIF taken from Apple’s demo video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wy6r-Dc-R5X2JAdmGgL-9cg-pCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471539/apple_clips_ar.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prism and Dance Floor effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOP8L0"&gt;Apple says that the AR Spaces effects should work with the other effects built in to Clips, such as the animated stickers and emoji, if you want to add even more to your videos. The update to the app can be downloaded now from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK2MkR"&gt;The Clips update is Apple’s latest experiment with AR, in which the company has a keen interest. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278780/apple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus"&gt;released an AR experience tie-in&lt;/a&gt; for its show &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind &lt;/em&gt;in February, and CEO Tim Cook discussed some of his thoughts about AR tech in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;an interview earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. There are also rumors that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;working on a full-fledged AR / VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in iOS 14.5 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;Starting with iOS 14.5, when you get a new phone, you’ll be prompted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. But if you’ve updated your current phone to 14.5, you don’t have to wait. This guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, your phone will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;If you’ve just updated to macOS 11.3, you can also select from the new options by going to System Preferences, then Siri. From there, you can choose the voice you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwMin9n3CbGzKfr5iRfznvl8qdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471503/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_1.02.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Siri voices have come to macOS as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The macOS 11.3 update includes a massive security patch and new emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mKe_exYNCZlsrBguqFyi40pdi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188772/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q3HA91"&gt;Apple has just released macOS 11.3, alongside iOS 14.5. It’s probably worth updating your Mac to it as soon as you can — not only because it comes with some new features, including improvements for running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs and updates to Apple Music and Podcasts, but it also fixes a major security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RgAIa"&gt;The update &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macos-113-patches-security-flaw-vulnerability/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29"&gt;reportedly patches a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that allowed malware to bypass many of macOS’s built-in protections, like File Quarantine and GateKeeper’s opening dialog box. While Apple’s built-in anti-malware system could &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/"&gt;still block malicious programs if Apple were aware of them&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise software company Jamf did find evidence that the security flaw &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/"&gt;was being exploited by attackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd3MC7"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212325"&gt;details a slew of other security fixes&lt;/a&gt; that are included with the latest update on its security update page. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Catalina and Mojave&lt;/a&gt; have received security patches as well, for those who haven’t yet updated to Big Sur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sqa92"&gt;Aside from security updates, one of the biggest new improvements in 11.3 (at least for owners of M1 Macs) is the ability to resize iPhone and iPad app windows. Apple’s also added keyboard, mouse, and trackpad support for games that are compatible with controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYZejN98nU34EvibuyHdn9myDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471373/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_12.18.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The infinity symbol in the queue controls the Autoplay feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="adDieb"&gt;Apple has also added autoplay to the Music app — a feature which is either great or annoying depending on your mood. After you reach the end of a song or playlist, Apple Music will continue playing music that it thinks is similar (thankfully, it can be turned off if you’re just looking to listen to one specific song). The News and Podcasts apps also have redesigned pages to make them easier to use (with the former getting a reworked search feature — something that’s exciting to me, and possibly no one else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHAOre"&gt;The update also adds many of the features that are in iOS 14.5: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;ability to track AirTags&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new emoji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;Siri voices&lt;/a&gt;, and support for the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. You can visit Apple’s site to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;see the entire list of updates and features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to unlock your iOS 14.5 iPhone with your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMdFEphfvF9abukIpdfb71urPwg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188189/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 is out, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. This will make it a lot easier to get through your day without having to enter your passcode each time you need to use your phone (because the Face ID can’t recognize you with that mask on). As long as your phone and watch are in close proximity, you will be able to unlock your iPhone just by turning on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 (and watchOS 7.4), it’s easy to enable the feature that lets you unlock your iPhone with your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jJTFRE"&gt;Toggle it on to turn on the feature. (There’s nothing you have to do on the watch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, when my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. Apple even warns you about this when you turn the feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpD-gKQYBs0Zk8CSxCmgskqnpas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471051/IMG_1328.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple warns you about the fact that your phone will only be looking for a face with a mask. (Note: “Beagle” is the name of my Apple Watch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, the watch buzzes you, along with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked and a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting again that the phone is looking for a face with a mask, so this feature won’t help you if your phone is lying on the table and you try to unlock it — because the Face ID camera can’t see you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, I find that not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be a relatively minor security trade-off. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 is out now with new Face ID mask features and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxHyIL_pFeBvJfzxv_5DCN6eO0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187801/akrales_201017_4238_0054.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5wYbbJ"&gt;Apple has begun rolling out iOS and iPadOS 14.5. The latest software update includes the new App Tracking Transparency feature, which lets users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity “across other companies’ apps and websites” for advertising purposes. A pop-up will now appear whenever apps are designed to share your activity in this way. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; Apple over App Tracking Transparency, claiming that it presents “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;a false tradeoff&lt;/a&gt; between personalized ads and privacy.” The new option could have a detrimental impact on Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1cuOw"&gt;Apple made a video to explain App Tracking Transparency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NEfPDq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ihw_Al4RNno?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0iFEZ"&gt;Perhaps more important to day-to-day iPhone usage, iOS 14.5 also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;a very helpful and timely new trick&lt;/a&gt;: if you own an Apple Watch, you can set your iPhone to automatically unlock without requiring a Face ID match or passcode as long as Apple’s smartwatch is on your wrist. This is designed to make getting into your phone that much quicker while we’re all still wearing face masks so frequently throughout the day. Installing watchOS 7.4 is necessary for this feature to work; that update is also available as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kZiE8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JJNXDH"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;a ton of new emoji&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on inclusivity. The update adds the ability to watch Apple Fitness Plus workouts on a TV with AirPlay 2. Apple’s Podcasts app is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;getting a new design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;optional subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. The latest video game controllers for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S are now supported on the iPhone and iPad as of this update. And all iPhone 12 models will allow for 5G connectivity in dual-SIM mode in more countries. Starting with the 14.5 update, Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;no longer default to a female-sounding voice&lt;/a&gt; for its Siri assistant. Instead, you’ll be prompted to choose your preferred voice during device setup. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403554%2Fapple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple has a post up&lt;/a&gt; with all of the miscellaneous improvements and additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl8z9p"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 is rolling out to iPhone and iPad users now; you can check the “software update” section in settings to begin the update process right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new $1 billion North Carolina campus and $80 billion additional US spending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA4XXy5oykpjVDYUdVabyCqF1Qs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186197/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HctfLO"&gt;Apple has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new spending plans&lt;/a&gt; for the US, including the establishment of a 3,000-employee “campus and engineering hub” in North Carolina and the commitment of an additional $80 billion in investment across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTPiv"&gt;Back in 2018, the firm said it would spend more than $350 billion in the US over the next five years, but today, it announced it is increasing that figure by 20 percent to $430 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMnJs"&gt;“At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBGFeQ"&gt;And why not? Like many big tech firms, Apple has done &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/tech-company-earnings-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html"&gt;very well during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, when other industries have suffered and investors have sought safe places for their money. The company likes to spin these investment announcements as a sort of largesse, but they are, of course, par for the course for a hugely successful and ambitious firm like Apple. As today’s press release notes, the $80 billion will go toward “direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tA4QfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple will invest in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rn2Ug4"&gt;The new campus in North Carolina is noteworthy and part of an ongoing trend among tech firms to look outside their traditional California homes. Google is currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/google-to-invest-1-billion-in-new-campus-in-new-york-city.html"&gt;investing&lt;/a&gt; $1 billion in a New York City campus; Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its second HQ in Virginia; and Oracle &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;oq=oracle+move+headquarters&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2768j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year it’s moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03fjHs"&gt;Apple’s North Carolina campus will be part of the state’s Research Triangle (named after the trio of nearby universities: Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The company will invest more than $1 billion in the area and pledges to create at least 3,000 new jobs in “machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HlVqX"&gt;Notably, Apple also says it will establish a $100 million fund to support “schools and communities” in North Carolina and will contribute more than $110 million to 80 of the state’s poorest counties to help fund critical infrastructure like “broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools.” The Biden administration has made such infrastructure spending a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;critical part&lt;/a&gt; of its plans for the US, but it seems that when government lags behind, private firms will step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvD22z"&gt;You can read Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403407%2Fapple-us-spending-new-north-carolina-campus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full press release&lt;/a&gt; for further details, including the companies expanding hiring in its teams in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, and Iowa, and its investments in new clean energy projects in the US and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Ted Lasso, Fathom, Annette, The Conjuring, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKrsNUueXMk8mDl_JgMmWfWsFYw=/459x0:4679x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69184273/1310834710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ted Lasso returns | Photo by SAGAwards2021 via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CmCS8F"&gt;The Oscars are tonight and despite my best efforts I still haven’t seen all the Best Picture contenders, so will hold off on making predictions (but honestly not sure how anyone beats Chadwick Boseman as Best Actor). Lots of good trailers this week including the return of the most wholesome show on all of streaming and the next big Marvel movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GzBVA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ldLYIo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/auxeLrtk7tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Q4Mqy"&gt;Ted Lasso Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l1kA0H"&gt;You know when you really love a show and it gets popular and everyone else likes it... and you brace for its sophomore season to be not quite as good as its debut? I am hopeful that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will not fall into this pattern, and the trailer for season two looks extremely promising (Ted: “Back home if a team was playing poorly, we don’t call them unlucky, what do we call ‘em, Coach?” Beard: “New York Jets.”) Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple return along with others from season one for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, which drops on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. And if you’re interested in a little bonus Ted Lasso content, developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401368/ted-lasso-shortbread-recipe-apple-spring-loaded"&gt;David Smith managed to figure out the recipe&lt;/a&gt; for the shortbread cookies Ted makes for Hannah. So wholesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOyvfq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fKPdgr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giWIr7U1deA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntvp1"&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8WmqO"&gt;The next big Marvel movie is the first to center an Asian superhero (and has an almost entirely Asian cast) and it looks very, very fun even if you don’t know the backstory and &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Shang-Chi"&gt;connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe&lt;/a&gt;. Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi, whose father trained him as a child to be an assassin. He tries to escape and live a normal life but as anyone who has ever watched a superhero movie knows, it ain’t that easy. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Awkwafina also star in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters September 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FG26RZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On4v1gNJkrE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oZMzpo"&gt;Annette&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kPckMD"&gt;Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard play a comedian and opera singer who fall in love and have a child they name Annette, “a mysterious little girl with an exceptional destiny.”  The trailer has that French cinema feel, for sure, which makes sense, since &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; is the English-language debut of French director Leos Carax. &lt;em&gt;Annette&lt;/em&gt; will open the 74th Cannes Film Festival on July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yYkxUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-Mmnk0LZLU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wrXtlc"&gt;Fathom &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6HDsVS"&gt;Scientists Michelle Fournet and Ellen Garland embark on separate research trips in opposite hemispheres to try to better understand the songs of humpback whales. No one really knows why whales “sing,” despite decades of research. It’s challenging work that one of the scientists compares to “pointing all of our satellites skyward and listening from a sign from outer space.” The trailer is just beautiful (obviously watch with the sound on).  &lt;em&gt;Fathom&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Apple TV Plus June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sALjCB"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CWRzzU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3v8n_8-QqA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GE0M4W"&gt;Here Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9eszwm"&gt;Billy Crystal wrote, directed, and stars in this movie about an aging comedy writer who befriends a woman (Tiffany Haddish) whose boyfriend bet on a date with him at an auction. Who would not be content to just watch Haddish and Crystal just bounce jokes off each other for 90 minutes? The underlying premise, though, is that Crystal is losing his memory and Haddish steps up to help him. &lt;em&gt;Here Today&lt;/em&gt; arrives in theaters May 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVXoUU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9Q4zZS2v1k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8fA9eW"&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uxBpNr"&gt;I continue to be surprised at the endurance of The Conjuring movies, which continue to be quite scary. I have to be honest that I’m not a super big fan of these movies because of the way they often put children in terrifying situations, a theme which seems to persist in this latest installment. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are back to investigate a murder committed by a young man who claims he was possessed by the devil. &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&lt;/em&gt; premieres on HBO Max and in theaters on June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone deciphered the Ted Lasso shortbread recipe from Apple’s Spring Loaded event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="27th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F2cbUx1T-EnEoNzr1RiJ88xhlik=/251x0:3491x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69181353/1310836738.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by 27th Annual SAG Awards/Getty Images for WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5eVII"&gt;During Tuesday’s Spring Loaded event, Apple announced (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;among other things&lt;/a&gt;) that the second season of its runaway hit show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;drop on July 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. This is extremely good news for fans of the show (including myself) who have missed the earnest football coach with the impossibly sunny outlook on life, which provided a bit of a respite during the coronavirus pandemic last summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2J6Vb"&gt;At the very end of Spring Loaded, however, there was a &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso-&lt;/em&gt;related Easter egg: a graphic of a little box with the text “Ted Lasso’s Secret Shortbread (Makes about one box).” The recipe itself was barely visible. But eagle-eyed developer David Smith was &lt;a href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2021/04/21/breadcrumbs/"&gt;able to read the text&lt;/a&gt;, and Googled it, only to find it matched a &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020851-bittersweet-brownie-shortbread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; recipe&lt;/a&gt; for shortbread (albeit a slightly different recipe than Ted’s). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrfXiPQ_-Js1hcJQjeb3_RwTaik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467320/ted_lasso_recipe.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n8hFOz"&gt;He blogged about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dqJMbm"&gt;Looking closely at the fractional letters visible I’m pretty confident that this first line reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d05zAA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 1/2 cups / 340 grams cold unsalted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces plus more for greasing pan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iTr3K"&gt;This is definitely a recipe for shortbread, I mean what else would need that much butter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="H8tYXH"&gt;That really is a lot of goddamned butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zM5Icz"&gt;For those who don’t watch the show (and why the heck not?), the shortbread cookies are a key part of the plot. Ted is trying to win over Rebecca, the owner of the English football team he’s suddenly coaching, and presents her with a small pink box that has the shortbread inside (we later discover that Ted has been baking the shortbread himself, not purchasing them, because that’s Ted for ya).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePLF2l"&gt;Rebecca enjoys them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35uz58gexTwque1gn5aIUIqCxOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22467315/ted_lasso_cookies.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy44AH"&gt;There are not many pure, good things on the internet anymore (she said as she wrote for an internet news site haha &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I did not mean &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we are great), but a little sleuthing to uncover a shortbread recipe from the best show on streaming reminds me of those innocent days gone by. Like &lt;a href="https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Believe"&gt;Ted reminds us&lt;/a&gt;: you just have to believe.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but if you want to buy the 64GB iPad Mini right now, it is available for its usual $400 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however, a sale on the 256GB, which is available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$480 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $530, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has been discounted in every color minus silver at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $699, which is $50 off its usual price of $749. Walmart has a sale on the iPad Air 256GB for as low as $699 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Sky-Blue%2F483096080%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08634Y7QW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,199 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $100 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,189&lt;/a&gt;.
