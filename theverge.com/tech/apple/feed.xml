    <title>Counterfeit wireless earbuds are being seized in record numbers at US border</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOc9geu894FJNlcKQmF2IgkMZ6s=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69591470/AirPods.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/CBPChicago/status/1407021736089079815/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMwSLT"&gt;The number of counterfeit wireless earbuds seized by US border customs in 2021 has already surpassed last year’s total, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airpods-are-a-huge-hit-with-consumers-and-counterfeiters"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sign of how eager the makers of these knockoffs are to keep riding the sustained popularity of earbuds like Apple’s AirPods and those from Samsung, Jabra, Bose, Sony, and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftpC8P"&gt;According to the report, “roughly 360,000 counterfeit wireless headphones” — valued at $62.2 million — were nabbed in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. That’s well above the 295,000 pairs that were confiscated during the whole of fiscal 2020. Just yesterday, US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/thousands-fake-apple-airpods-worth-13-million-seized-cincinnati-cbp"&gt;announced a major confiscation&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyvo0A"&gt;Around 80 percent of fakes entering the US come from China, and their manufacturers see a huge opportunity: &lt;a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-True-Wireless-Stereo-Headset-Sales-Surge-90-in-2020-as-Chinese-Vendors-Surge/default.aspx"&gt;Strategy Analytics&lt;/a&gt; forecasted worldwide sales of Bluetooth headsets to be more than 300 million in 2020, and the true wireless earbuds market surged by 90 percent. Apple still holds a commanding lead in market share, though a crowded field has cut into that dominance. Research firm Canalys estimates that Apple took in at least $16 billion from AirPods sales last year, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; report. The introduction of the AirPods Pro in 2019 gave scammers a chance to try and wring even more money out of unknowing buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJcpfVFw7_W-F1lW4xc5kJPbDgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721822/clones.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/331000-worth-fake-airpods-seized-cbp-officers-louisville" target="_blank"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A confiscated shipment of AirPods counterfeits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w5v7lp"&gt;OnePlus had to deal with an awkward controversy last September when US Customs and Border Protection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435637/us-cbp-counterfeit-airpods-oneplus-buds-mixup"&gt;seized a shipment of the company’s earbuds&lt;/a&gt; and described them as counterfeit AirPods. There are design differences between the two, but the blatant AirPod clones are getting closer and closer to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LcIAZ"&gt;Some counterfeit earbuds are suspected to have been created “with genuine molds stolen from factories that work with Apple.” Others can mimic the AirPods pairing process on an iPhone and display a proper Apple serial number. But even in these situations, there are still subtle tells (like a bogus firmware version) that reveal a product as a fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlzhRG"&gt;Highlighting the potential safety risks, Apple says it has a global effort in place to tackle the issue of knockoffs, and it’s working with law enforcement and e-commerce sites to prevent customers from being duped wherever possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9pekq"&gt;Whether you’d like to admit it or not, school is quickly approaching. And if you’re in need of a reliable laptop that won’t force you to completely deplete your savings, Chromebooks aren’t a bad way to go. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; deliver great value for the money, and many offer terrific performance for far less than you would pay for a more premium machine. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one such device, even if the high-end convertible is one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEUc0Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 model packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CDZr8x"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now-discontinued HomePod,&lt;/a&gt; the HomePod Mini is somewhat easy to forget. Apple’s pint-sized answer to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; still produces good sound for its size, though, and Siri remains a viable alternative to Alexa and Google Assistant, despite lagging behind when it comes to features and functionality. The compact smart speaker also plays nice with HomeKit-compatible devices and Apple Music, rendering it a device really built for those who are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598683-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsg_homepod_mini_space_gray.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F16%2F22577815%2Facer-chromebook-spin-713-apple-homepod-mini-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering a rare $10 discount&lt;/a&gt; on Home Pod Mini, bringing the price down to $90 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xpKyaN"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions easing and in-person gatherings become more commonplace again, now might not be a bad time to pick up an extra controller for your Xbox One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or Windows 10 machine.

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoEJx-ejU8P8R7snEItUUlFIHFo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589716/DSCF5698.jpg_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than 6,000 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hkEz0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;survey on remote work&lt;/a&gt; conducted by employees in June, 36.7 percent of respondents said they were worried they’d have to leave Apple due to the lack of flexibility (1,735 people answered the question).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBg79W"&gt;The return-to-work plan has already been a flashpoint at Apple, where employees wrote a letter in June asking Apple CEO Tim Cook to reevaluate the hybrid model. Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;sent a video in response&lt;/a&gt; saying that in-person collaboration was “essential” and noting the company would not be backing away from its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1xHzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be out of a job in September”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HielYm"&gt;While Apple’s corporate employees certainly have more flexibility than the retail staff, some say it’s out of step with other big tech companies in Silicon Valley. Twitter and Facebook have already announced a permanent work-from-home policy, and Apple employees say they’ve been flooded with recruiting messages from other tech organizations eyeing a potential opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld1Cht"&gt;One employee said they were currently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation that allowed them to work from home, but were told that accommodation would be denied when the company went back to the office. “I will be out of a job in September,” they wrote in Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jt11t"&gt;Apple typically gives employees 30 days to find a new job within the company if their current team denies a medical accommodation. But one worker said in Slack that there weren’t any open remote positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBKN7"&gt;Some employees say they were told only people with documented medical conditions would be approved for permanent remote work. But the form that Apple employees use to request such an accommodation asks them to release their medical records to the company, which made some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LoIqvo"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Things I'd never sign: &lt;a href="https://t.co/4KUv2DVQTT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4KUv2DVQTT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1415798144726671360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6QlI"&gt;Now, employees are discussing how to get Apple’s attention. Some suggested writing another letter to reiterate their concerns, while others have discussed talking to lawyers about possible legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToWXQ8"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elago’s Siri Remote case has room for an AirTag tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuoLHyBDPGfB8zRCoAsmhJzZeNQ=/164x0:1946x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585417/siri_remote_airtag_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PREMIUM SILICONE! | Image: Elago&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xpvVDC"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote arrived &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448388/apple-tv-4k-siri-remote-no-uwb-u1-couch-thickness"&gt;without a built-in locator chip&lt;/a&gt;, so Elago has created the next best thing: the &lt;a href="https://www.elago.com/apple-tv/2021-apple-tv-siri-remote-r5-case-black-1"&gt;R5 silicone case&lt;/a&gt; with a slot for Apple’s new AirTag tracker. According to Elago, it features a “THICK LAYER OF PREMIUM SILICONE,” which is so dense it can only be expressed in caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCD7LC"&gt;The $14.99 price doesn’t include the cost of the $29 AirTag, but it does promise to put an end to lost Siri remotes, especially if you own an iPhone fitted with UWB to enable precision tracking. It costs a lot more than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Faf%2Fsiri-remote-airtag-case.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F15%2F22578412%2Fapple-tv-remote-airtag-case-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparable AirTag cases available on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; that list for just a few dollars, but well, this one can be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/elago-Locator-Compatible-Remote-AirTag/dp/B097WZQV1Z/?tag=9to5toys03-20%5C" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for whatever that’s worth. Alternatively, you could always &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;just 3D-print your own case&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in more of a DIY mood. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two Fire TV Edition TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRIl6CVdBf_cSWN_jAr9Ezf2gMA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584030/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXQ8jp"&gt;Amazon is adding support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two of its Fire TV Edition TVs in a free update, the company &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Both the 2020 Toshiba 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Dolby Vision and the 2020 Insignia 4K UHD Smart TV will receive the features, before they arrive on Amazon’s less expensive Fire TV sticks and set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7OgeT"&gt;On these specific TV sets, AirPlay 2 should function the same on Apple’s own Apple TV, allowing you to send audio and video from your phone, tablet, or computer to the big screen and control playback from your device. Integrating with HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, requires a little extra legwork: you’ll have to enable HomeKit in your TV’s settings under Display &amp;amp; Sounds &amp;gt; AirPlay &amp;amp; HomeKit &amp;gt; Set Up, and then add it as a device in the Home app. Once it’s added, you can use Siri to turn your Fire TV on and off, change the volume, or switch inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRKpf"&gt;Both AirPlay 2 and HomeKit coming to Fire TVs (and hopefully, one day soon, Fire TV sticks) should make using the TVs with Apple’s devices that much easier. Apple already has an in with Amazon’s devices — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930244/apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick-models-now-available"&gt;Apple TV Plus app came to Fire TVs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX6Z41"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how these two companies were interacting a little over five years ago, Back then, Amazon had banned sales of competing hardware like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9439281/amazon-ban-apple-tv-chromecast-why"&gt;Apple TV (and Chromecast, and Nexus Player)&lt;/a&gt; in its marketplace because it claimed it was important to only sell media players that “interact well” with Prime Video. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/14/16777508/amazon-brings-back-apple-tv-google-chromecast"&gt;have since reconciled&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a very favorable deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;for Amazon that allows it to avoid Apple’s 30 percent App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; and use its own in-app purchase system. Now things are better. At least if you own an iPhone and Fire TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest iOS and macOS betas undo some of Safari’s controversial new design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ex3ewRdUIaBcOxNm-UnH4abg61M=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582867/safari.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hy5JjJ"&gt;Apple has released its third developer betas for the upcoming iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, and they bring some much-needed fixes to Safari — namely, undoing some of the more controversial changes introduced in the earlier betas. For macOS, that means a normal tab bar that goes back to the previous design, while iOS is getting a more consistent design when it comes to the URL bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJjTt2"&gt;iOS 15 is still sticking with its new tab view and the moved URL bar on the bottom of the display, but the latest beta docked it there permanently, instead of bouncing it to the top of the screen when you selected it. Apple’s also added a new refresh option to the pop-over menu when you tap and hold the URL bar. Together, the changes help make the new design a lot more cohesive to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkcnTe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As expected, Apple is continuing to tweak the design of Safari in iOS 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In beta 3, the address bar is now docked above the keyboard. There is a new search UI and support for quick website searches too. Getting better! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tm562Djr0i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Tm562Djr0i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1415368283793109000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1Xser"&gt;The change to macOS is simpler: Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-beta-3-brings-redesigned-safari-tab-interface-to-address-complaints/"&gt;seems to have just brought back&lt;/a&gt; part of its Big Sur design for Safari’s URL bar and tabs, ditching the combined tab/URL bar setup that it debuted in the earlier betas. In the latest beta, there’s once again a URL bar that lives at the top of each Safari menu, with a row of tabs beneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEwSEr"&gt;Each of those tabs still takes up a decently large piece of real estate — the overall Monterey design is the same in that regard — but it’s definitely an improvement over the original betas. That said, if you preferred the new design, that’s still an option too, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/revert-safari-redesign-macos-monterey-beta-3/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI0lCV"&gt;Unchanged, at least for now, is the iPadOS version of Safari. Given that Apple isn’t expected to fully release its latest OS updates until the fall, though, there’s still plenty of time for additional changes to Safari across all of Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAShaI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 is one of many Apple Watches currently on sale. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZqOTAE"&gt;The highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bRFJnd"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (38mm, GPS): $168 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$199&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lREHEL"&gt;Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS, white): $269 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkBwh-RgExnTVM0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals060721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;s&gt;$279&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BR7xFN"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS, red): $319 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; ($&lt;s&gt;399&lt;/s&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="ParVAK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the watchOS 8 public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558944/watchos-beta-install-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $168 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in either white or black, which is $31 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped white version of the SE for $269 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Right now, deals are relatively scarce on the Series 6.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746200082884103876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $179 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/oendKE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, are currently selling the AirPods Pro for just shy of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max haven’t historically seen large price drops — they only made their debut in December, after all — their price has been steadily falling in recent weeks, leaving them at an all-time low. Currently, all colorways of the AirPods Max are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746203302394629120#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $473 and $480, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s educational ‘Today at Apple’ classes are launching on YouTube with a Peanuts-themed session</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjaJIZ9WGSLKpmK_8KscUL0kTHk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69580223/Snoopy02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn how to draw yourself as a &lt;/em&gt;Peanuts&lt;em&gt; character in the first “Today at Apple” YouTube session.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rUqCvi"&gt;Apple is bringing its educational “Today at Apple” classes to YouTube, the company announced Wednesday. The first episode will show you how to draw yourself as a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; character in the company’s Pages app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU1Kgc"&gt;The session features two people who work on the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt; — showrunner Mark Evestaff and storyboard artist Krista Porter — and it’s hosted by an Apple Store employee named Anthony. I’ve watched the nearly 10-minute episode, and it’s a pretty easy guide to follow about turning yourself into a &lt;em&gt;Peanuts&lt;/em&gt; cartoon. Unsurprisingly, it’s packed with Apple technologies; Anthony and Porter draw on iPads using Apple Pencils, and they’re collaborating in the same Pages document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ijEdo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today at Apple” first launched in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQkzIU"&gt;Apple first announced the “Today at Apple” program in 2017 as a community-focused feature of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15419398/apple-store-redesign-genius-bar-grove"&gt;larger retail makeover&lt;/a&gt;. But the company has had to move &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftoday%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22576342%2Ftoday-at-apple-youtube-classes-sessions-peanuts-snoopy-show" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some sessions online&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, which forced Apple to close down many of its US retail stores. Although all 270 US stores reopened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the pandemic began, this new YouTube series signals that Apple is still working to build ways to educate its customers without requiring them to step inside a physical store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrHHJJ"&gt;The first episode of the series is available now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o3YkOQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayWPho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 9:15AM ET: Added the first episode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
