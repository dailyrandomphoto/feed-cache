    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for Apple discounts ahead of Cyber Monday, you won’t find them at Apple, even if the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts/shopping-event"&gt;bundling Apple gift cards with almost all of its latest products&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Many of these retailers started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Cyber Monday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals happening now&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals you can get across all products, brands, and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DpLcAU"&gt;The third-gen AirPods were released just last month, and now you can buy them on sale for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The extra $20 off is reflected at checkout. These newest base-model AirPods may not have noise-cancellation but their hard-plastic design should fit most ears while offering IPX4 water resistance, improved sound quality, and spatial audio. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hQOZ8w"&gt;The popular AirPods Pro can be had for $170 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=48&amp;amp;imprToken=12beac1d-3fc0-1d9b-f48&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to its normal full price of $249 (saving you $90). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3urgh0XZ0?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/apple-airpods-pro/-/A-84852592?preselect=77603773#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22556052%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also have it marked down but only to $190. The latest AirPods boast a MagSafe-ready charging case and shorter stems, as well as better battery life and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lLCckh"&gt;Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, are selling for &lt;s&gt;$100&lt;/s&gt; $115 instead of $159 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for &lt;s&gt;$150&lt;/s&gt; $100 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="RVzOFA"&gt;Last year’s M1-equipped MacBook Air is, in our opinion, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, you can buy the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM for $1,399 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals on noise-canceling headphones 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CXi2TP8qUlAHiVFP0_WedsUgWMc=/5x0:803x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177196/Screenshot_2021_11_27_114547.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Embrace the silence&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d5KTAD"&gt;Whether you’re overdue for a new pair or are just trying to cancel out the usual onslaught of holiday music, Cyber Monday is a great time to invest in some noise-canceling headphones. You’ll find significant discounts on many of our favorite headphones featured in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;noise-canceling headphones buying guide&lt;/a&gt;. These include picks from Sony, Bose, Apple, Sennheiser, and others. In some cases, these deals will save you $100 or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKhJxM"&gt;Aside from the steep discounts, another good thing about buying headphones during the holidays is the extended return period at many retailers. That gives you plenty of time to try out your new cans and make sure the sound quality, ANC, comfort, and other factors are all to your liking before you’re stuck with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="maTlax"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"},{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals on true wireless earbuds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22792011/black-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="BdzHRb"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones deals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="zyLNwd"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 remain our overall pick as the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy today. They’ve got excellent noise cancellation, lively bass-forward sound, and fantastic comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="3mytn2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ApgUlE"&gt;Released only a few months ago, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones mark a return to the company’s classic design that has no equal when it comes to comfort. You can wear these things for hours upon hours without any issues. It also helps that Bose made improvements to sound quality and ANC compared to the QC35 II headphones. The QC45s haven’t really been on sale since their release, so the Cyber Monday 2021 deals are coming at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="nLXvMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="D4gpLa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3wgngs"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max in white can be had for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$429 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from their hefty $549 standard price. The green and pink are a bit higher (but still on sale) at $479.  The AirPods Max justify their price with top-tier sound quality, terrific noise cancellation, great voice call performance, and the usual deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jCtQQh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pmB83v"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all the way down to &lt;s&gt;$220&lt;/s&gt; $245&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, which makes for big savings compared to their regular $400 price tag. With a classy, premium look and feel that’s matched by their phenomenal audio quality, the Momentum 3s are perhaps the best choice if you’re focused on sublime sound over everything else. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals under $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdMXbdPPlSu0GsfiVldAI5YaqLE=/0x196:1179x982/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181956/ajohnson_210702_4659_0003_sq.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Still plenty you can get for under $25&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ld9a3y"&gt;If our roundup of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22792008/black-friday-2021-pc-accessories-computer-cyber-monday"&gt;best tech deals you can still get under $50&lt;/a&gt; was outside your budget, don’t worry: there’s also plenty you can buy for under $25. Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products during Cyber Monday, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Va5kw"&gt;For your convenience, we’ve curated a list of some of the best sub-$25 options below. If you’re looking for more holiday gift ideas that won’t break the bank, however, we’ve also put together separate budget-based gift guides for items under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hulu, for example, is giving away &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.2655&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;type=4&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of its ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just 99 cents per month (instead of the usual $7) if you subscribe before November 30th. Both new and returning customers who haven’t been Hulu subscribers within the past month can take advantage of this offer. Other services including Amazon, are also offering similarly great deals, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800858/black-friday-2021-streaming-deals-shows-movies-subscription-cyber-monday"&gt;check out a full roundup of here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="29iX39"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;For iPhone owners planning on traveling this holiday season, Amazon’s offering a great deal on Apple’s official AirTag Loop. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own, you’ll need such a loop to securely attach them to luggage, keys, and other items. Unfortunately, these loops can be as expensive as the AirTags themselves. Thankfully, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-Loop-Deep-Navy/dp/B0932LZM6K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting the loop made to carry Apple’s popular Bluetooth tracker, selling it an all-time low of around $18 instead of $29. This deal is valid on the deep navy colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XnECMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOcQkL"&gt;Like Apple’s AirTag, Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus locates lost items ranging from keys to pets. Even though it can work with both iOS and Android devices, we recommend it more for Samsung users as it’s designed to work best with Samsung Galaxy devices. The convenient Bluetooth tracker features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio so you can more accurately track items and use the AR mode to see exactly where your missing tag is. To use the UWB radio, though, you’ll need a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone. The tracker can also be used as a remote control for Samsung smart home stuff. It’s a great buy for those embedded within the Samsung ecosystem, especially right now, as the tracker is going for $25 instead of $40 today at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRNSVRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a-smart-tag-1-pack-black-ei-t7300bbegus%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mobacc-042720-142010-verge-8259575%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D8259575%26utm_content%3Dmobacc%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;amp;a=1745743455626377571&amp;amp;uuid=b35751ff-a0af-4e83-9776-063d4c38d134&amp;amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;amp;ar=1758359825979119625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PULPjx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPzUR"&gt;For Xbox owners, we found a phenomenal deal from &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital/-/A-76626995&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560195%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll want to act fast on. You can pick up a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pass for $25 instead of its usual $45 — which is nearly 50 percent off. This pass gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. It also offers access to more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;launches next month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBwzN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="skLdA8"&gt;Speaking of video games, several of the best are also discounted and selling for $25, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeearlycybermonday2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F232850.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few others you can pick up for around the same price or even less, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096BX7WMZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($20), Marvel’s &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMarvel-s-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Square-Enix-with-Walmart-Exclusive-SteelBook-PlayStation-4%2F765263786" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy &lt;/em&gt;alongside a SteelBook&lt;/a&gt; ($25), and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dback%2B4%2Bblood" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($25).

&lt;div id="tMT4Sv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10759065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7nnaNh"&gt;It may be an older model, but the third-generation Echo Dot is still a great device that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;we once called&lt;/a&gt; the best cheap smart speaker you can buy. It’s far superior to its predecessor, with a loud and rich sound we praised. Right now, you can pick one up from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3AhGMNtIY" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for just $20, saving you $35 on an otherwise $55 bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6JvWEJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLMzzl"&gt;For those who prefer Google smart speakers, the Google Nest Mini is currently 50 percent off at multiple retailers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the small smart speaker a great upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini, one that sounds far better. The Nest Mini also makes it easy to add Google Assistant to your home. It lacks the Echo Dot’s 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection, but, unlike Amazon’s device, you can hang it on your wall without extra accessories. Right now, you can pick one up in various colors for 50 percent off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal/741412707?athbdg=L1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fblack-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-mini-2nd-generation/-/A-78589456?preselect=76500134#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are all selling the speaker for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7cYUPB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At the moment, Amazon is even taking 50 percent off of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=124&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbea42d-e732-8263-21f&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553294%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with the third-gen Alexa remote. Typically $50, you can pick one up right now for $25, the device’s best price to date. It may not be as capable as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=94&amp;amp;imprToken=1abea435-1abd-7fcc-e1c&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22548186%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt; instead of $55), but it’s still plenty fast and supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10 Plus, and HDR10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="u5Bg1h"&gt;Those curious about Google’s Stadia game streaming service may want to check out this Stadia Premiere Edition bundle discount, which is available for more than 70 percent off. The $80 bundle comes with a white Stadia controller, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to around $58 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;

While we weren’t blown away by the camera, we found that it still offers good video and audio quality for its price. Typically $35, you can buy the already affordable camera for $20 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, those new to Blink’s ecosystem will have to pay an additional $3 per camera each month for cloud storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21231112/blink-mini-smart-home-camera-security-cam-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="H8c3BI"&gt;The myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is cheaper than ever for Cyber Monday.

    <title>The best Cyber Monday 2021 phone deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TV2rUTuVpNRpAG49VywGKdFFgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187660/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.20.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are still some good deals to be had on the newest iPhones.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXFrPb"&gt;Need a new phone? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; is a great time to be shopping for a phone for yourself or as a gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday season. This is the time of year when retailers and carriers are dropping their best deals, whether it’s to make room for next year’s models or to sign up new cellular customers. Android users can cash in on a number of excellent deals from the likes of Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and Motorola; however, Apple is notoriously stingy when it comes to iPhone discounts. You might get a gift card or a pair of AirPods when buying an iPhone, or a carrier might offer a higher trade-in value for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;“free” iPhone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPtDSg"&gt;Here are all the best Cyber Monday phone deals we’ve found so far. If possible, we recommend buying an unlocked phone, so there won’t be any strings attached to the purchase. If we include a carrier promotion, we’ll call out each requirement necessary to get the deal. Given all the supply issues many phone makers have been having all year, there might not be a lot of stock available out there. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lN9CKF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Cyber Monday deals happening now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"},{"title":"The Verge Cyber Monday 2021 live blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22807793/cyber-monday-2021-live-blog-lightning-deals-tech"},{"title":"The best phone to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fBJR1Q"&gt;Apple iPhone Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UqdK1t"&gt;From our experience, Apple doesn’t offer price cuts on any of its iPhone models. At most, you’ll get a pair of free AirPods and/or a gift card to use toward a future purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g0EjRt"&gt;Samsung phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZogOsh"&gt;This year’s Samsung phone deals aren’t much better than Apple’s: you get a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2, but there aren’t any deep price cuts unless you have some devices you can trade in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3bp5ZH"&gt;The best deal so far is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806048/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-cyber-monday-deal-2021"&gt;$500 off the Galaxy Z Flip 3 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="xhpFJL"&gt;All the OnePlus Black Friday deals seem to agree that the already budget-friendly OnePlus Nord N200 5G should be cheaper than $240, with &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMetro-by-T-Mobile-OnePlus-Nord-N200-5G-Blue-Prepaid-Smartphone%2F692138281%3Fathbdg%3DL1800&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayPhoneDeals2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart dropping its price to a jaw-dropping $99&lt;/a&gt; for Metro by T-Mobile customers. It has some fancy features like a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. This deal is only valid online and in-store through November 28th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple gets hit by its second fine by Italian regulators in a week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LBjlGki4acR-qyFFzjYAvxHqBlo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70194294/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GXTk4k"&gt;Apple and Google have each been fined €10 million (around $11.3 million) by Italy’s competition authority for not properly obtaining a user’s consent before using their data for commercial purposes, the &lt;a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150"&gt;AGCM has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Both are accused of not correctly informing users when their data will be used in this way, preventing customers from being able to give their informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czayeN"&gt;In a statement, Google said it disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal. “We give people simple controls to manage their information and limit the use of personal data, and we work hard to be fully compliant with the consumer protection rules,” a spokesperson said. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L8CeWr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google plans to appeal the fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuoWwD"&gt;This is the second time Apple has been fined by the Italian regulator this week, after it and Amazon were &lt;a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/I842-"&gt;hit with fines totaling over €200 million&lt;/a&gt; (around $225 million) on Tuesday for restricting who’s allowed to sell Apple and Beats products on Amazon’s Italian store. A 2018 agreement between the two companies meant that only certain resellers are allowed to sell the products on Amazon.it, the regulator said, adding that this broke EU competition rules. Alongside the fine, both companies were told to end the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tX38vC"&gt;Both Apple and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italys-antitrust-fines-amazon-apple-more-than-200-mln-euros-alleged-collusion-2021-11-23/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they plan to appeal Tuesday’s fines. Apple said that agreements like these are in place to guarantee that customers are buying genuine products. Amazon called the fine “disproportionate and unjustified” and added that its deal with Apple benefits Italian customers who “can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store,” and are “benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTlQVp"&gt;A €10 million penalty is unlikely to register on Apple or Google’s balance sheet. Apple recently reported making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;$83.4 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;in revenue last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Google made $65.1 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Veyh3n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 26th 7:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Google’s statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AR headset coming next year with ‘Mac-level’ power: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52E4BL2LL_2XTn0yF_OhrTyf0Xw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70193990/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6OEZ2"&gt;Apple’s first AR headset will be released in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to a research note from analyst Ming-chi Kuo seen by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apples-ar-headset-to-launch-in-2022-with-mac-level-computing-power-will-operate-without-the-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo predicted back in March that the headset would be released sometime next year, and is now also providing more technical information on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6hy6W"&gt;The headset will have two processors, according to Kuo, one with “the same level of computing power as M1” and one lower-end chip to handle input from the various sensors. For example, Kuo says that the headset has “at least 6-8 optical modules to simultaneously provide continuous video see-through AR services.” The headset is also said to have two 4K OLED microdisplays from Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aNFxyl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2wOXUe"&gt;Kuo cites the headset’s “Mac-level (PC-level) computing power,” its ability to be operated untethered, and its wide range of applications as factors that will differentiate it from competitors. Various reports on the device have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;disagreed&lt;/a&gt; as to whether it will be wholly independent or rely on an iPhone or a separate processor box to stream content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvDtRe"&gt;Kuo seems convinced that it’ll be a standalone platform, however, writing “If the AR headset is positioned only as an accessory for the Mac or iPhone, it will not be conducive to the growth of the product. An AR headset that works independently means that it will have its own ecosystem and provide the most complete and flexible user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Getting something great costs less than $50&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NGkXEr"&gt;Looking for a new TV gadget to stream all of your favorite entertainment? Buying an excellent streaming device is easier now than ever before — and the prices only continue to drop and get more appealing: $50 is the sweet spot if you want a streaming stick or set-top box that can do crisp 4K resolution, Dolby Vision / HDR, and immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. But you won’t even have to spend that much given many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;best Cyber Monday deals&lt;/a&gt; are now live, some of which drop our top picks to as low as $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHTVXg"&gt;Each of the picks below has its own strengths, whether it’s a snazzier interface, better voice controls, or a more comprehensive universal search for digging through all of your services. Depending on your wants, there are several good contenders, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; stands out as the best streaming device for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xj845F"&gt;Pretty much any 4K TV you buy today will come with a batch of built-in streaming apps. But they won’t always have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. So a dedicated streaming device is the best way to guarantee you’ll be able to watch that show or movie everyone’s been talking about. You can spend less money on entry-level Roku or Amazon streaming players, but you’ll be better off with one of our recommendations if you want your purchase to last. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features and fantastic price of the Chromecast with Google TV make it the best streaming stick for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9cOJvp"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best streaming stick for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3U9Abh"&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the home screen on a streaming stick should look like. That’s really the long and short of why the Chromecast with Google TV has taken the crown of best streaming player. With its new Google TV software, the company has taken a content-first approach that feels more focused and refined than what Amazon and Apple have managed in their own attempts to aggregate popular shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr5ZDG"&gt;On a Roku or Fire TV, my instinct is always to head right for the app where I want to watch something. But with the Chromecast, I’m equally happy browsing through Google’s rows of recommendations. The Google TV software always clearly shows where content is coming from — you can pick which streaming apps get factored into these recs — and it also provides helpful information (like Rotten Tomatoes ratings) at the surface level when you’re hunting for that night’s entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XINYdJ"&gt;When you actually hit play, you’re punted over to Netflix or Prime Video or HBO Max just like always, but there’s no avoiding that. In terms of app selection, Google’s got all of the main players covered. You can still cast content to the Chromecast from your phone or laptop, and Google Assistant voice searches consistently work well and showcase Google’s accurate voice recognition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uHgD8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has done the best job figuring out what the software on a streaming device should look like&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKXPL"&gt;Everything about Google TV feels tasteful, from the fonts to the way the background color subtly shifts to match the artwork of whatever content is highlighted. And the universal Watchlist, which lets you put together a list of stuff you’re interested in from various streaming services, is super convenient — especially since you can add to it from the web or your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUEQwj"&gt;But not everything about the Chromecast with Google TV is perfect. The software can feel slow and gets bogged down more often than I’d like, and some customers have &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/07/chromecast-google-tv-data-corrupt-android-cant-load-error/"&gt;encountered significant bugs&lt;/a&gt; that Google has tried to iron out with software updates. More annoyingly, despite the hardware supporting both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, there are still very popular apps like Disney Plus — which delivers both on other platforms — that aren’t doing so on the Chromecast. HBO Max says it does Atmos, but that hasn’t been my experience. Why? Who knows, but these inconsistencies are a mark against Google. And as for the Watchlist, some services like Netflix have already started removing their shows from it. Again, that’s something Google has no control over, but it does lessen the feature’s usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1vJvx"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roku’s Streaming Stick 4K improves on the Streaming Stick Plus by adding Dolby Vision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="z2csvA"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hOCseD"&gt;The best streaming device for people who want to keep it simple &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7O9OD"&gt;It’s hard to really complain about a Roku. The company’s streaming devices are about as simple and straightforward as they come. All of your apps are laid out in a big grid and easily accessible. Roku has tried to touch up and modernize the home screen a bit with new sections like “Featured Free” to highlight content you can stream without any subscriptions, and in recent years the company has also added support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 and, if you have a smart speaker, compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qjIbaE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGj91j"&gt;Roku has pretty much all of the entertainment you could want, but has a history of getting into spats with streaming services. For example, it’s possible that YouTube will be dropped from the platform in early December as Google and Roku remain unable to reach a new deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vpEPv"&gt;Roku’s neutral universal search remains one of the best aspects of the platform, ranking your existing subscriptions and free-to-stream options over purchases and rentals. And the company’s Roku Channel has grown into a legitimate streaming app of its own, offering a mix of ad-sponsored movies, TV shows, and live news for those days when you’re burned out on combing through Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVnPjT"&gt;The Streaming Stick 4K, introduced in 2021, is now the best overall pick among Roku’s hardware when you weigh price and performance. It takes everything that was great about the popular Streaming Stick Plus and beefs up performance a bit, adds support for Dolby Vision HDR, and comes with the latest Roku voice remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4IoeY"&gt;If there’s one area where Roku falls flat, it’s probably voice search. Your voice queries for specific shows or movies should work well enough, but Roku lags Amazon and Google when it comes to natural language interactions. (And forget about using your voice to control smart home gadgets or look up entertainment-related facts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mqu6OJ02NVqztRrNUIgGTb3A18E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541100/DSCF3875_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K offers the most consistent, reliable performance of any streaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JRXodl"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K (second-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWJwP1"&gt;The best streaming device overall experience (for a steep price)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="M2y4K0"&gt;It’s fair to look at the Apple TV 4K as overpriced compared to its competitors, but Apple’s set-top box still has its own set of appealing qualities. The interface is fantastic. It supports Dolby Vision and Atmos across a wide variety of services, has all of the important apps checked off, and also gives you add-ons like Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness Plus (if you pay for them) that you won’t find on other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0yQqy"&gt;Apps sometimes have a higher level of polish on Apple TV and are generally better about taking advantage of everything the box can do. Another benefit of the Apple TV is privacy — to some extent. Apple itself isn’t obsessed with tracking your viewing data in the same way that a company like Roku is, but the streaming apps can still see what you’re doing. I generally think consumers aren’t particularly averse to sharing their streaming habits, but Apple’s privacy practices might matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUc2Xv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7S0fB"&gt;Even with AirPlay now on Roku, the Apple TV still wins out for people deeply invested in Apple’s ecosystem. You can use HomePods as its speakers or connect two sets of AirPods for private listening with audio sharing. You can view the feed from HomeKit security cameras or see who is at the door if you have a HomeKit video doorbell. The Apple TV still makes it easy to tap into content on a Mac in your home, and services like Apple Music and iCloud Photo Library are right there in easy reach on the TV screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0nOC"&gt;And with the 2021 model of the Apple TV 4K, Apple has finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;redesigned the Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; with a much simpler, more intuitive button layout that adds power and mute controls. It’s larger and harder to lose in the couch cushions, too. The second-gen Apple TV 4K is also now more future-proofed as a smart home hub with the inclusion of Thread support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Yh1ylb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUIxeRu3Ap0Ke3UUm9Rd5A54RzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909969/DSCF5782.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is among the first streaming gadgets to support Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6ajwme"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mO4Da0"&gt;The best streaming stick if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iAlxyK"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max is yet another excellent pick in that $50-ish range of streaming gadgets. The upgraded hardware offers speedier navigation, adds support for Wi-Fi 6, and maintains the vast selection of entertainment as Amazon’s other streamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HanEXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885062"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oDfmk8"&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max’s software is similar to the Chromecast in that the home screen takes a content-forward approach instead of just throwing a grid of apps at you. Amazon still tends to showcase (and advertise) its own Prime Video content more prominently than shows and movies from other services, which can get annoying at times. But Alexa voice commands with the remote also work reliably, whether you’re saying “open Netflix” or asking to dim the smart lights in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i6E5A2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351738"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JiAvz9"&gt;There’s also the $120 Fire TV Cube to consider. It’s essentially a hybrid streaming device and smart speaker. Rather than make you press and hold a button to speak to Alexa like with the Stick 4K, the Cube takes a hands-free approach and has beamforming mics that respond to “Alexa” prompts just like an Echo speaker would. It also features something Amazon calls Local Voice Control, which allows it to understand more spoken commands without needing help from the cloud. The Fire TV Cube has a more powerful processor than the Fire TV Stick 4K, making it the fastest of the Fire TV bunch, but the difference isn’t very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pssjk4"&gt;When it comes to their streaming capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube are on equal footing. And you could always put the money you save by going with the Stick toward one of those new sphere-shaped Echo Dots, which will sound far better than the Cube’s tinny built-in speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zkClUu"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia’s Shield TV, the best streaming player for home theater experts and gamers, pictured on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEmAuOHlgj4pGSulYPpS4vSMAlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19324253/DSCF4370.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s Shield TV is a powerful Android TV streaming box that’s popular with home theater enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qJ9DFz"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ktAsFL"&gt;Best streaming device for home theater enthusiasts and gamers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bTK5Wu"&gt;Home theater enthusiasts, gamers, and people who like to tinker with their streaming devices have loyally stuck with Nvidia’s Shield TV and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Shield-Android-Streaming-Performance/dp/B07YP9FBMM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. They can serve as excellent players like any of our other picks, but you can also go more advanced and use them for cloud gaming or set up a Plex media library (in the case of the Pro). GeForce Now and Steam Link probably do more to sell gamers on the Shield lineup versus something like Apple Arcade on the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="useqbH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmo5EB"&gt;The Nvidia Shields currently run Android TV with Google Assistant built in, but it’s expected they’ll eventually get the same Google TV experience that’s on the Chromecast. Nvidia’s AI-powered upscaling can eke out some extra detail from the shows and movies you stream, and I’d rate the included remote control (with backlit buttons, even) as the most ergonomic of them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVfT5g"&gt;But like with the Apple TV, the main hurdle here is the price. The Nvidia Shield TV costs $150, so you’re looking at spending $100 more than devices that offer most of the same functionality. You get Ethernet and a very powerful streaming device for the added premium, and you can push the Shield TV farther and make it do more than just about any of its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="WJAPbS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Friday may be over, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;is here. Thankfully, to make sifting through the sea of endless discounts easier, we’ve rounded up the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best phone deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best Cyber Monday deals available now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, if you’re looking for other sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3x5kdo"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="88R0ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10861652"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id="wXnufN"&gt;The best phones 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fEdsxM"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 2K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="r9nZkH"&gt;Best Android phone under $500 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nicCXJ"&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists. It’s only available from Google’s online store because carriers don’t carry the Pixel 5A, but it’s worth the effort to get this hidden gem of a $450 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kYmA"&gt;The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67). Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a 90Hz screen, or 5G support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="WJAPbS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has arrived, bringing with it an abundance of great discounts. To make sorting through sales a bit more manageable, check our guides to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789359/black-friday-2021-best-phone-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best phone deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best Cyber Monday deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;overall, if you’re looking for other discounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7By4QV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget this holiday season, we’ve got good news: you’re more likely to find mid-range sub-$500 phones available than many of the hottest flagships of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY6SyC"&gt;Due to an unfortunate series of events — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, labor shortage, the pandemic, and global shipping delays — retailers are having a hard time keeping phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 13 Pro in stock; Samsung has been hit particularly hard with supply issues all year. Fortunately, there are many excellent alternatives that are nearly as capable and cost a lot less to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU3Cg6"&gt;Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are also finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with lower prices and more premium features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoCnCZ"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;much harder. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything well at this price point. So prioritize the features that matter most to you, whether it’s 5G compatibility with a particular network, high-resolution screen, low price, best camera, or longevity with software updates. It’s difficult to get straight A’s in every single one of these needs, but if you’re able to tolerate the occasional B, you’ll find a phone you’ll love. We recommend getting an unlocked phone for the best price and portability, but you might find better deals by buying through a carrier and signing up for a wireless plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhy7y"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;If you’re looking for the best budget Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice. You’ll find an all-around good phone with a flagship-level camera, three years of software updates from Google, plus IP67 water resistance — all at a lower price than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuCkqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best iPhone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QjIUAS"&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation) strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YYEN"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today, which also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High-refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, but you won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TvHua"&gt;The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is two years behind the latest and greatest and won’t win any benchmark races. (That would be the A15 chipset in the iPhone 13 lineup.) It’s still plenty performant, though, and it’s often hard to tell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="878itp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bwzf"&gt;the difference between a two-year-old iPhone processor and a brand-new one in use. But why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in comparison to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUd3WA"&gt;Cellular connectivity is limited to LTE, which is fine for now but might be limiting in a few years when 5G networks become more widely available. If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="smYbEU"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LCnMV"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sub-$500 Android phone, the Pixel 5A is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZV88A"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A has a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery, too: a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7mEy"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor. The 5A’s dual rear-facing cameras (main and ultrawide), Snapdragon 765G processor, as well as the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination, were inherited from the 4A 5G and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4bk7u"&gt;Software is another area where Pixel phones shine, and the 5A is no exception. It launched with Google’s own Android 11 OS and has already gotten upgraded to Android 12. The software is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uppsrx"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but you will be able to access the slower but more common, sub-6GHz 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7fhLs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cubsS1"&gt;But there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using in the near future called the C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release: it isn’t being sold through any of the major US carriers, but you can buy it from the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-5a-5g?id=CR6HaBzv0AUAEggeh2gc79AFAA%3D%3D"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;. All in, the Pixel 5A is still the budget Android phone we’d recommend. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best phone display for $500 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qpM5xB"&gt;If you’re looking for the best display for your money, the $500 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great option for future-proofing your phone, albeit at the very top of this buying guide’s price range, but it’s well worth its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpya2a"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now, the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99z3je"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise, everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating are handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIU18y"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="85J3ce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ZNpo"&gt;includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 5A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INZwJl"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by, so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;Best 5G phone for under $300 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpXOg"&gt;At $299, the OnePlus N10 5G brings 5G and some upscale features to a budget phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge4QQF"&gt;While you won’t find a fantastic screen here, its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits and only supports sub-6Hz 5G networks. It launched with Android 10, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XlPkb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4Y1Qv"&gt;OnePlus has released the update to Android 11 already. But that’s it — don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model. OnePlus is offering two years of security updates in addition to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FucmrC"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 5A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB1WYg"&gt;If you prefer Samsung phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth your consideration for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive at $279 and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nicer features, like a higher refresh rate screen, good cameras, and a nicer implementation of Android. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtHJH"&gt;What if both the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G are just beyond your budget, but you still want a 5G-ready phone in this price bracket? Luckily for you, the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; retails for $240 (or lower from carriers) and includes some fancy features as well. You’ll be treated to a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. Yes, it only works on T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz 5G network but will function as a 4G phone on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. For the price, it’s not a bad way to get in on all the 5G action. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S has an usually vibrant screen for its class, thanks to TCL’s television display expertise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best 4G phone under $300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="npapoA"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, and good battery life, all for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRkfu4"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’ vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhlvTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA2h68"&gt;While the 20S’ camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLPoSw"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice that should work on all major 4G networks in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorola’s Moto G Stylus (2021) is a good phone whether you’re a stylus devotee or just style-curious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;6.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Stylus (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;The best budget phone with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MC6Jne"&gt;It’s slim pickings for Android users who want a new budget phone with a stylus. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG exiting the smartphone market this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung pausing (or perhaps ending) its premium Galaxy Note series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only Motorola’s Moto G Stylus left to hold the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y0rd"&gt;Of the Motorola budget devices we’ve tested this year, the Moto G Stylus (2021) offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyyTGB"&gt;It has a big 6.8-inch LCD display at 1080p resolution, good battery life with its 4,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. Thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor and 4GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs just fine with the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="fJsUIu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VEksQ"&gt;occasional hiccup. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44WwOS"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ stylus is built into the device like the Galaxy Note. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;There’s no telling how much longer Motorola will make the Moto G Stylus, so if you want a budget phone with a built-in stylus, you should grab one while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjmzFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885207"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UcHD0D"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="TCL 20SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y23HLKFT4D2eX5y-WPCxRJk6IUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911281/gsin_190125_4797_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Gloria Sin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class .&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. TCL 20SE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The best 4G phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3LcHIR"&gt;There are not many great phones available in the sub-$200 range, but the $190 TCL 20SE is a rare gem of its class. It has a 5,000mAh battery, ample onboard storage, and a beautiful “nano-photoetched” back that makes this budget phone look more expensive than it is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPgkC4"&gt;As the most affordable model of the TCL 20 series, the TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that is quite low in resolution at 720p but delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class — thanks to TCL’s television screen expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbBgrN"&gt;The 20SE’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor is supported by 4G of RAM, where they work well enough together to make &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; mostly playable, albeit with a slight lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7K8RPt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This budget phone looks more expensive than it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeESwB"&gt;Unlike other budget phones in this space, the 20SE comes with a generous 128GB of internal storage, plus a micro SD card slot for even more capacity. In addition, its 5,000mAh battery lasted a whopping 32 hours on one charge, using only Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1o43"&gt;While the 20SE’s 48-megapixel main camera can take great snaps in natural light, it’s not really meant for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfkexN"&gt;All things considered, TCL 20SE is a smart choice for a sub-$200 4G phone, especially If you won’t be using Verizon as your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;However, if you’re on an even tighter budget and need a 4G phone that will work on all the major carriers, you should consider Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787370/moto-g-pure-review-4g-android-budget-phone"&gt;Moto G Pure&lt;/a&gt;. Retailing at $160 for the unlocked version, you may be able to find deals as low as free at some carriers — if you sign up for a plan this holiday season. While the Moto G Pure is slower and smaller than the TCL 20SE, it has a more capable 13-megapixel main camera (f/2.2 aperture) that works admirably in low-light situations. Unfortunately, the G Pure only comes with a paltry 32GB of internal storage, so you’ll need to budget for a microSD card to expand its extremely limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yq4gTc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875340"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s ad-supported streaming plan costs just $1 per month to join</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBjR8hLOMw5B1TYi57QtEviL28w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187122/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lVoLnK"&gt;Black Friday sales are in full swing, and now some popular streaming services are starting to join the party. Through November 29th, both new and returning customers who qualify for the deal can enjoy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;offerid=852731.2655&amp;amp;subid=0&amp;amp;type=4&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12 months of Hulu’s ad-supported streaming service&lt;/a&gt; for just $1 per month. Typically $7 per month — or $84 per year — that equates to a $72 discount or about 85 percent off. While you’ll see an ad popping up every now and then with this plan, you can still access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on your TV, streaming box, tablet, laptop, console, and other devices. Two people are also allowed to simultaneously stream on this plan as well, and you can have up to six users profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7fr8g"&gt;While newcomers to Hulu shouldn’t face any obstacles in signing up for the deal, returning customers can only reap the savings if they haven’t been a Hulu subscriber within the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZwhoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883069"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pkl0rw"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 is selling for its best price yet. Right now, you can save $150 on all configurations. The specific model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;we liked in our review&lt;/a&gt;, which uses an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU paired with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, is just $1,550. Compared to its predecessor, we were particularly impressed by its improved battery life and the faster AMD CPU. Other things to like about this model are its fantastic keyboard and the 3:2 aspect ratio display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijKlae"&gt;For more discounts on the Surface Go 2 and other laptops, check out some early Black Friday deals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796308/microsoft-black-friday-2021-deals-laptops-cyber-monday"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VrIY6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;If the Surface Laptop 4 is a little out of your budget — and you’re a Costco member — you can pick up Apple’s 13.3-inch MacBook Air with an M1 processor, which is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops around&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of costing $950 and up, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/macbook-air-13.3%2522-%25e2%2580%2593-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%252c-7-core-gpu-%25e2%2580%2593-8gb-memory-%25e2%2580%2593-256gb-ssd-%25e2%2580%2593-space-gray.product.100688258.html"&gt;you can get it for $800&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price yet. This model has an eight-core Apple M1 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we gave the laptop a 9.5/10 (one of our highest scores &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;), praising the laptop’s fast performance and excellent battery life. It’s a good all-around option for many and a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even some very light gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZJpWg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bpG75h"&gt;Less than a day after offering Apple’s $179 third-generation AirPods for just $155, Amazon sadly sold out. Thankfully, however, Woot is now offering a similar discount, selling the newest pair of Apple’s true wireless earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAirpods3rdGeneration112321/https://www.woot.com/offers/new-apple-airpods-3rd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $170&lt;/a&gt; instead of $179. It may not be the $15 discount Amazon was offering, but it’s still one of the lowest prices we’ve seen yet on the newly released AirPods, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;our pick&lt;/a&gt; for one of the best wireless earbuds you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="paMk4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7l0C0"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of earbuds that offers solid active noise cancellation (which the newest AirPods mentioned above don’t), Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price"&gt;are a great pick&lt;/a&gt; with “sublime” sound. One of the few problems, though, is their usual $300 price. That’s twice as expensive as the likes of the AirPods, but at least with today’s deal, that is no longer the case. They’re selling for $197 when you pick up the black model. That’s just over a $100 discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bfuBxa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K6hbuX"&gt;Last but not least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785870/verge-merch-store-black-friday-sale-2021-code-cyber-monday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; fans can enjoy 20 percent off&lt;/a&gt; our own merchandise at &lt;a href="http://store.theverge.com/?_ga=2.146931447.191173471.1637596108-392483003.1630346675&amp;amp;_gl=1*11yslyb*_ga*MzkyNDgzMDAzLjE2MzAzNDY2NzU.*_ga_9GXHZT6RVE*MTYzNzc2NzY2NC4yODMuMS4xNjM3NzY4MjQwLjA."&gt;The Verge Merch Store&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEBF &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. We recently revamped our store to commemorate our 10th anniversary, introducing everything from new shirts and hoodies to notebooks and posters, all featuring a variety of witty and creative designs. The Black Friday sale runs through 11:59PM ET on Monday, November 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="xbAOoR"&gt;Here are other notable deals happening now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GYBddk"&gt;Both new and returning customers can enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku"&gt;four months of a subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon’s eBook reading service, Kindle Unlimited, for just $5 instead of $40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ghnIWe"&gt;Walmart is taking $50 off of the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1207219/9383?subId1=VergeDeals112421&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Charge-4-NFC-Activity-Tracker-Black-Black%2F599342265&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit Charge 4&lt;/a&gt;, selling it for $69 instead of $120. The fitness tracker comes with built-in GPS, as well as other perks, including contactless payment and Spotify controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jXyRDH"&gt;Amazon is offering the first discount on the latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tile-1-Pack-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant-Compatible/dp/B09B2NYJ3T?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tile Slim tracker&lt;/a&gt;, which is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. Typically $35, you can buy it for $28 instead. This product launched last month, and it offers features like water resistance and the ability to locate your smartphone by using the tracker as a remote. &lt;/li&gt;
