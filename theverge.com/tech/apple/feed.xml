    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents involved in the case once belonged to LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/14/apple_google_patents/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, but were obtained by Optis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef1C6I"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday but told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that it plans to continue to fight the decision. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate,” the statement reads. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzv9dF"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F07%2Fapple-reports-third-quarter-results&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F15%2F22625796%2Fjury-apple-pay-300-million-patent-dispute-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; record third-quarter revenue of $81.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s controversial plan to try to curb child sexual abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z3Ld4HzH_dTWyXO8gjMRz1XVXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69725913/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple ‘s plan to scan iOS devices for CSAM imagery has proven controversial | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why privacy experts are concerned&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="dc6dr1"&gt;When Apple announced changes it plans to make to iOS devices in an effort to help curb child abuse by finding child sexual abuse material (CSAM), parts of its plan generated backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twOtsC"&gt;First, it’s rolling out an update to its Search app and Siri voice assistant on iOS 15, watchOS 8, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey. When a user searches for topics related to child sexual abuse, Apple will redirect the user to resources for reporting CSAM, or getting help for an attraction to such content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jhnc4"&gt;But it’s Apple’s two other CSAM plans that have garnered criticism. One update will add a parental control option to Messages, sending an alert to parents if a child age 12 or younger views or sends sexually explicit pictures, and obscuring the images for any users under 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX8SA"&gt;The one that’s proven most controversial is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;Apple’s plan to scan on-device images to find CSAM&lt;/a&gt; before they images are uploaded to iCloud, reporting them to Apple’s moderators who can then turn the images over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the case of a potential match. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;Apple says the feature will protect users&lt;/a&gt; while allowing the company to find illegal content, many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;Apple critics and privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt; say the provision is basically a security backdoor, an apparent contradiction to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;Apple’s long-professed commitment to user privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says its iCloud scanning will rely on multiple child safety groups to address privacy fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia0PCmtxH75mxbYkGpWC9GLEEtk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723200/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHOhKl"&gt;Apple has filled in more details around its upcoming plans to scan iCloud Photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) via users’ iPhones and iPads. The company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf"&gt;released a new paper&lt;/a&gt; delving into the safeguards it hopes will increase user trust in the initiative. That includes a rule to only flag images found in multiple child safety databases with different government affiliations — theoretically stopping one country from adding non-CSAM content to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAlWLt"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS and iPadOS releases will automatically match US-based iCloud Photos accounts against known CSAM from a list of image hashes compiled by child safety groups. While many companies scan cloud storage services remotely, Apple’s device-based strategy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;drawn sharp criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some cryptography and privacy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNC7E2"&gt;The paper, called “Security Threat Model Review of Apple’s Child Safety Features,” hopes to allay privacy and security concerns around that rollout. It builds on &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Apple executive Craig Federighi, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623336/craig-federighi-apple-icloud-photos-iphone-ipad-csam-scanning-auditability"&gt;outlined some of the information&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GWcN8"&gt;In the document, Apple says it won’t rely on a single government-affiliated database — like that of the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC — to identify CSAM. Instead, it will only match pictures from at least two groups with different national affiliations. The goal is that no single government could have the power to secretly insert unrelated content for censorship purposes, since it wouldn’t match hashes in any other database.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A venn diagram with one circle labeled “Apple Child Safety Organization #1 hash list,” one labeled “Child Safety Organization #2 hash list,” and the overlap labeled “Apple only uses the intersecting hashes of two or more child safety organizations.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfZtkVvGXvygEumbVZ86p-PnRRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781290/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_3.35.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Security_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3FdB"&gt;Apple has referenced the potential use of multiple child safety databases, but until today, it hadn’t explained the overlap system. In a call with reporters, Apple said it’s only naming NCMEC because it hasn’t yet finalized agreements with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XByiVR"&gt;The paper confirms a detail Federighi mentioned: initially, Apple will only flag an iCloud account if it identifies 30 images as CSAM. This threshold was picked to provide a “drastic safety margin” to avoid false positives, the paper says — and as it evaluates the system’s performance in the real world, “we may change the threshold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqgB8O"&gt;It also provides more information on an auditing system that Federighi mentioned. Apple’s list of known CSAM hashes will be baked into iOS and iPadOS worldwide, although the scanning system will only run in the US for now. Apple will provide a full list of hashes that auditors can check against child safety databases, another method to make sure it’s not secretly matching more images. Furthermore, it says it will “refuse all requests” for moderators to report “anything other than CSAM materials” for accounts that get flagged — referencing the potential for using this system for other kinds of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhTTw"&gt;Federighi acknowledged that Apple had introduced “confusion” with its announcement last week. But Apple has stood by the update itself — it tells reporters that although it’s still finalizing and iterating on details, it hasn’t changed its launch plans in response to the past week’s criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a new Castlevania game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bI9eCXa-GFkTcZnrkrg8Qzu4fsE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721901/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRo2hd"&gt;With the exception of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;an anime series on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, the last few years have been quiet when it comes to the gothic action series &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;. It looks like that’s about to change, though: developer Konami just announced a new game coming exclusively to Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z3fkCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFIiYt"&gt;The new title is called &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s described as “an original side-scrolling action game that features a line-up of classic, well-loved characters from the series’ hit catalogue.” The graphics certainly look like a departure for the series, but there are some notable names on board, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, both of whom have contributed to the series since the iconic &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t have a release date, but Apple says that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ygusmb"&gt;If the name sounds familiar, it’s probably because Konami previously soft-launched a version of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt; in Canada &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;before shutting it down last year&lt;/a&gt;. That iteration was free-to-play with added microtransactions, a feature that is absent from all Apple Arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXzwRr"&gt;The news comes at a fairly busy time for Apple’s subscription games service. Today sees the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a classic RPG from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585353/apple-arcade-tetris-beat-skate-city-tokyo-monster-hunter-stories"&gt;the music-focused &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Craig Federighi says Apple’s child safety scanning will have ‘multiple levels of auditability’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzJYUURQ9UFgjUd0TWsSS-N-4HU=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721417/1232992663.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPKT38"&gt;Apple executive Craig Federighi says iCloud Photos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;plans to scan for child sexual abuse material&lt;/a&gt; (or CSAM) will include “multiple levels of auditability.” In &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Federighi — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — offered new details about its controversial child safety measures. That includes a claim that the iPad and iPhone’s device-level scanning will help security experts verify that Apple is using the system responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZeals"&gt;Like many companies with cloud storage services, Apple will check iCloud Photos images against a list from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), looking for exact matches with known CSAM pictures. But unlike many services, it will run searches on the device, not fully remotely. “Imagine someone was scanning images in the cloud. Well, who knows what’s being scanned for?” Federighi said, referring to remote scans. “In our case, the database is shipped on device. People can see, and it’s a single image across all countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DjUrf"&gt;Federighi elaborated slightly on how this might give people confidence Apple isn’t greatly expanding the database to include material besides illegal CSAM, particularly in countries with restrictive censorship policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMPNRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5anlI"&gt;“We ship the same software in China with the same database we ship in America, as we ship in Europe. If someone were to come to Apple [with a request to scan for data beyond CSAM], Apple would say no. But let’s say you aren’t confident. You don’t want to just rely on Apple saying no. You want to be sure that Apple couldn’t get away with it if we said yes,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. “There are multiple levels of auditability, and so we’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country, as far as what images are part of this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7s92c"&gt;Apple has previously said that it’s only rolling out the system in the United States and that it will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-says-any-expansion-of-csam-detection-outside-of-the-us-will-occur-on-a-per-country-basis/"&gt;consider launching in other countries&lt;/a&gt; on a case-by-case basis. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple will ship the hash database of known CSAM on the operating system in all countries, but it will only be used for scanning in the US. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; further clarifies that there will be an independent auditor who can verify the images involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7QNze"&gt;Federighi also offered more detail on when the scanning system will notify an Apple moderator of potential illegal content. Apple has said before that a single match won’t trigger a red flag — a measure intended to prevent false positives. Instead, the system generates “safety vouchers” for each match and alerts Apple if the number hits a certain threshold. Apple has declined to publicize the exact threshold, saying this could let abusers evade detection. But Federighi says it’s “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFkTE8"&gt;Some security experts have offered cautious praise of Apple’s system and acknowledged the importance of finding CSAM online. But many have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;criticized Apple’s abrupt rollout&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of clarity on how the system worked. In his interview with the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Federighi acknowledged the confusion. “It’s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft’s popular subscription service — which touted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;more than 18 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — has been dubbed the “Netflix of video games,” namely because it provides access to more than a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26epi%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528TnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22622197%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-apple-watch-series-6-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hundred Xbox titles&lt;/a&gt; for a flat, monthly fee. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate takes things a step further, combining Xbox Game Pass with Xbox Live Gold, giving subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on iOS and PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQE5WR"&gt;Typically, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate runs $45. And while &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s ongoing promotion&lt;/a&gt; will knock the price down to $1 for new subscribers, it’s not available for returning players. Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can purchase a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global%2Fbest-pick&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22622197%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-apple-watch-series-6-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-month subscription at Eneba for $30&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. The sale price will fluctuate around $30.85 (with service fees), but if you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;XGPU3VERGE&lt;/strong&gt;, the price should come in just shy of $30 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MdR7AP"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t a direct sequel to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s better off for it. The midrange Chromebook hits all the right marks, while retaining an affordable price tag that becomes even more appealing when you factor in its &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-13-3-qled-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-fiesta-red%2F6448525.p%3FskuId%3D6448525&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;current sale price at Best Buy: $600&lt;/a&gt;. For the money, you get a functional laptop with a gorgeous QLED display, all-day battery life, and a bright, eye-catching finish that’s sure to turn heads no matter where you go (it’s also available in a “mercury gray”). It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, and it comes with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a Core i3 processor, which should be enough for everyday use. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only does the Series 6 boast a wealth of health features and an always-on display, but it comes with built-in sleep tracking and a strong ecosystem of third-party complications, a hallmark no other smartwatch manufacturer has yet to replicate. The watch’s deep integration with the iPhone only bolsters the wearable’s appeal alongside watchOS 7, a mobile operating system built to handle all the basic features we’ve come to expect in a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZaCmI"&gt;Normally $430, you can purchase the 44mm, GPS-enabled &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/b3Do0m"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 at Target right now for $360&lt;/a&gt;, one of the better prices we’ve seen on this particular model in recent months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Eddy Cue’s title to better reflect its turn to services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eddy cue" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jh0tWKaCOCJsN2Sg4SIygIt4zQ0=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717596/2013-06-10eddycue-1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jgwTry"&gt;Apple rolled out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Feddy-cue%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622178%2Fapple-eddy-cue-job-title-update-senior-vp-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small but meaningful update&lt;/a&gt; to senior executive Eddy Cue’s job title on Thursday that features an area of interest the company has long been focused on: services (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/12/eddy-cue-title-change-services-apple/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Eddy Cue is a longstanding veteran at Apple who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265172/itunes-store-at-10-how-apple-built-a-digital-media-juggernaut"&gt;helped build iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and the App Store, but his new title of “Senior Vice President, Services” reflects the company’s increasingly important side hustle, if not outright transformation into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;a media business and subscription peddler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3iqBM"&gt;Prior to Thursday, Eddy Cue was senior vice president of internet software and services, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303073700/https://www.apple.com/leadership/eddy-cue/"&gt;with responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; that included overseeing the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Maps, Search Ads, iCloud, and iWork. His new job description emphasizes Apple’s subscription darlings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6r296t"&gt;Eddy oversees the full range of Apple’s services, including Apple Music, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, the Apple TV app, and Apple TV Plus, as well as Apple Pay, Apple Card, Maps, Search Ads, Apple’s iCloud services, and Apple’s productivity and creativity apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ApPa26"&gt;Apple still makes a ton of money selling hardware and software — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;earning a total of $81.43 billion during the third quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — but its services business has specifically been growing as of late, earning an all-time revenue high of $17.5 billion during the same quarter. Apple’s found major success &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;in streaming hits like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that may have helped, and seems primed to take even bigger, more &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;-sized swings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;with shows like &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mETswq"&gt;Cue’s had a hand in many pies over his time at Apple, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240584/apple-eddy-cue-siri-craig-federighi"&gt;managing Siri for a period&lt;/a&gt; before Apple began to actively compete with Google Assistant. He’s also now infamously known as one of the few executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;who pushed for Apple to bring iMessage to Android&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an email exchange between Cue and senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi that was dug up as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhLGX"&gt;A title change might not mean that much in terms of what Cue does day to day, but it is yet more evidence that Apple’s services business is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RotckP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl1ehU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lvlgv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password 8 on the Mac brings a big redesign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NtDvhQr91Risk3Yk6Mq3T4x1bU=/24x0:2124x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711539/HeroUnlocked.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="URwxbR"&gt;A few weeks after 1Password started rolling out the &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;Windows version of the redesigned 1Password 8&lt;/a&gt;, the company is now &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-mac-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;showing off the Mac version&lt;/a&gt; of the update, which is also available today to try in early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X65Io"&gt;Like the Windows version, 1Password 8 on the Mac features an overhauled design, which aims to make it clearer when items are being shared, who they’re shared with, and better labeling of groups in the sidebar.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-MUEbWlGs5qVyTPSyopWZhNDsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776517/WatchtowerDashboard.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PQjfm6"&gt;There’s also a new search bar, which shows suggestions as you search (similar to Apple’s Spotlight or Alfred), and an updated version of Watchtower, which shows a comprehensive overview of your overall password security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5jp1U"&gt;Lastly, the new app overhauls the editing window, which the company says includes a “new password generator, smart suggestions, and simpler file attachments.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agKgppnnD6WRmE7ghTm4WTwjpfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776518/opm8ea_unlocked.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Uehl"&gt;1Password 8 looks like a fairly sizable update, and users will have to opt in to the early access build to try it out today. &lt;a href="https://1password.community/discussion/122136/"&gt;Instructions are here&lt;/a&gt;, but doing so requires deleting the old 1Password 7 app and then installing the new version. Additionally, while the flashy new features and design look fun, the company cautions that 1Password 8 is “for testing and validation purposes only and is not suitable for business critical environments.” So you might not necessarily want to use it for anything super important just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIDt42"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrwfK9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators target Apple’s App Store exclusivity in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InVLqrBh-kXo9CAONa4Uq094tG4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711309/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zPgcBF"&gt;There’s a new bill introduced in the Senate Wednesday targeting the power dominant tech firms like Apple and Google have over the app store market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXF6EJ"&gt;The bipartisan “&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;,” introduced by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) would ban app stores from forcing developers to use the store’s payment systems. It would also bar companies from punishing developers that offer lower prices on a separate app store or through their own payment systems, along the lines of Apple’s public dispute with Epic Games. Notably, the bill would also make it unlawful for companies like Apple to use non-public data from their stores to build competing products against companies using their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mXlLqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNBQst"&gt;“For years, Apple and Google have squashed competitors and kept consumers in the dark—pocketing hefty windfalls while acting as supposedly benevolent gatekeepers of this multi-billion dollar market,” Blumenthal said in a statement Wednesday. “This bipartisan bill will help break these tech giants’ ironclad grip, open the app economy to new competitors, and give mobile users more control over their own devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOnZMb"&gt;An Apple spokesperson responded to the bill in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday, writing, “Since our founding, we’ve always put our users at the center of everything we do, and the App Store is the cornerstone of our work to connect developers and customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy.” The spokesperson continued, “At Apple, our focus is on maintaining an App Store where people can have confidence that every app must meet our rigorous guidelines and their privacy and security is protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0PBEX"&gt;Earlier this year, the Senate Judiciary Committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;hauled in representatives&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Spotify, Tile, and Match Group, a dating app company, to explain how Apple and Google’s app store policies and fees harm their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4O8gs"&gt;Specifically, Tile’s General Counsel Kirsten Daru said that once Apple decided to make its own competing item-tracking device, the company made it more difficult for Tile products to work on the devices. Match’s Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine also said that app store fees are the company’s single largest expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbX1Ud"&gt;“We have worked toward creating a fairer and more competitive app marketplace for both developers and consumers,” said The Coalition for App Fairness, which counts Epic Games as a member, in a statement Wednesday. “The bipartisan Open App Markets Act is a step towards holding big tech companies accountable for practices that stifle competition for developers in the U.S. and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXe3CQ"&gt;Still, tech-backed think tanks like Chamber for Progress argue that the bill could pose a safety risk for consumers. “This bill is a finger in the eye of anyone who bought an iPhone or Android because the phones and their app stores are safe, reliable, and easy to use,” Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said Wednesday. “I don’t see any consumers marching in Washington demanding that Congress make their smartphones dumber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDz23s"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;creator Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; challenged the app store model with lawsuits Apple and Google, asking for a court-ordered injunction that would have similar effects to the proposed bill. A federal judge is currently reviewing the Apple case to determine whether the company violated antitrust law by implementing these policies. Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;40 state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; have also sued Google over its app store model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjbIYg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8/11/21 at 3:38PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods are on sale again for their lowest price to date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZtjQ8nUeUXb8jxWZ-2HCKGaQVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709202/akrales_190327_3315_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAd3ld"&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are more of a refinement than a revolution, but if you’ve been waiting for the price to come down before jumping on the AirPods bandwagon, now might be the best time to do so. Although they’re often discounted to just shy of $160, Apple’s iconic earbuds and their wireless charging case are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available at Amazon for $130&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the in-ears to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klnFI4"&gt;The latest AirPods lack the noise cancellation and flexible design found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, however, they still manage to deliver satisfying sound quality and dependable battery life. Plus, they’re incredibly easy to use with both Apple and Android devices, even if you do lose the double-tap gestures and a bit of convenience with the latter operating system. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="klTSye"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XAR7O5"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is currently discounting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a range of PS5 exclusives, along with at least one of Sony’s first-party accessories: the PlayStation HD Camera. The simple black-and-white device is built with streamers in mind, and as such, it features dual 1080p lenses, a built-in stand, and a set of software tools that let you crop your background or remove it entirely if you’re utilizing a green screen. It’s not compatible with the PSVR — Sony &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/09/ps4-games-on-ps5-your-top-questions-answered/"&gt;has confirmed as much&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s still a great way to broadcast yourself alongside your gameplay. Right now, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5V8L7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $40&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the Sony peripheral since it launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iG8e1L"&gt;While many of us can understand the appeal of traditional books, there’s no denying the appeal of a device like the Kindle Paperwhite. Amazon’s 10th-gen device is a great way to lug your books around town — whether you own one or 1,000 titles — and comes with a crisp 300ppi, six-inch E Ink panel and support for Audible audiobooks. It’s also waterproof and, unlike most modern devices, lasts for weeks on a single charge, meaning you rarely need to worry about grabbing a power brick before heading out the door. Normally $130,  the 8GB, ad-supported version of the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite---waterproof--ad-supported--10th-generation-%2F-%2FA-75574430"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite is available at Target today for $85&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best deals we’ve encountered on the popular e-reader outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
