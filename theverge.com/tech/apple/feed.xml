    <title>The iPhone 13 may finally get features Android has had for years</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APrmyo"&gt;It’s new iPhone day. And as with any new smartphone announcement these days, we have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;fairly decent idea of what to expect&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks and rumors are more accurate than ever, and though there’s always the potential of a big surprise, the most likely scenario is the iPhone 13 will be what we think it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXjXsF"&gt;Just because the rumors are clear doesn’t mean they’re not exciting, though. This year, the iPhone 13 (we assume that’s the name) will have some new technology in the same design. New designs tend to drive big upgrade cycles, but it’s the second year of the design that usually has the most interesting refinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQuJJ"&gt;We can list them out fairly quickly. There should be four iterations again: a Mini, a regular, a Pro, and a Pro Max. The higher-end iPhones should have an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display, a low-power kind of OLED screen that makes it easier to have a variable refresh rate. The processors will be faster. The MagSafe charging system will be tweaked. There may be new storage options. The camera will be better, with improvements specifically in HDR and Portrait Mode video — plus astrophotography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgAmZ3"&gt;All those specs will translate into some newer, nicer experiences. There’s one in particular I want to focus on: the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiwNKM"&gt;The LTPO display should mean that the iPhone can finally have an always-on lock screen. It should also finally enable smoother transitions as the screen ratchets from some tiny number of Hz to some large number like 120Hz instead of being locked at 60Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlObj2"&gt;Notice the “finallys” in that last paragraph. They’re there because variable refresh rates and always-on screens have been available on Android phones since... forever. In fact, if you run down the rumored features of the new iPhones, many of them appeared first on Android. In addition to high refresh rate screens, there’s better quality wide-angle cameras, huge storage, portrait mode video, and astrophotography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZVR57R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"},{"title":"iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3X0Ms9"&gt;Though the specs may be copied, the question comes back to the “experience.” The cliche with Apple is that it rarely does something first, but instead comes in later with refinements and does it &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;. That cliche exists because it’s often right. You may have been able to turn on portrait mode for video on a Samsung phone since 2019, but believe me, you wouldn’t want to use it for anything important, because it’s bad. Apple’s, hopefully, will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8kodL"&gt;That narrative isn’t always correct, though. In some cases, it just papers over Apple just being straight up late to including a piece of technology. I am open to being wrong, but I hesitate to believe that it’s possible to make an always-on lock screen experience so insanely great that that every one before feels broken. It’s a lock screen you can glance at! There’s only so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKlarI"&gt;An always-on lock screen is also super useful! Being able to quickly see the time, date, and some notification icons is the sort of low-pressure ambient information a phone should be able to provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CmqUr"&gt;Variable refresh rates are a little less useful, but so much nicer. They can preserve battery life by slowing down refresh rates. They can match the screen’s refresh rate to the content (eg. in a movie or a game). And they can make animations and scrolling look so much smoother. And yet, the only notable Apple devices to feature a high refresh rate are its high-end iPads. Meanwhile, every high-end Android phone and many midrangers have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDPDDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does Apple feel competitive pressure to include small, nice-to-have features?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOAVkN"&gt;I’m honestly a little baffled as to why it’s taken Apple this long to make such obviously nice features. One possible explanation — and maybe the most likely — is simply that Apple has felt no competitive pressure to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSKNkN"&gt;On Android, there are so many phones to choose from that the need to differentiate is urgently and keenly felt by every manufacturer. So a feature as minor as an always-on display could make the difference in somebody’s purchasing decision. But I struggle to imagine the person that would choose an Android phone over an iPhone simply because they like glancing down at the time on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4sDXo"&gt;So: why launch a variable refresh rate screen now? It’s gotten to the point where it’s a little embarrassing — many reviews of the iPhone 12 models pointed out this missing spec. And though iOS does still look smooth and feel fast at 60Hz, going to 120Hz has been Android’s brute force way of catching up in those departments. Switching iOS up to 120Hz could push Apple ahead again. So there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some competitive pressure, it just takes a bit longer to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWjTGE"&gt;I also suspect that Apple was simply waiting for component prices to come down and manufacturing yields to go up. The scale at which Apple needs to make phones makes both a requirement. But I feel like if Apple felt a little more competitive pressure, it could have pushed more aggressively to solve those problems sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkL1bU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android vs. Android is a war of tiny differences — iPhone vs. Android is something else entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xI9kyI"&gt;The point here is that there are lots of little features that iPhone users are missing out on simply because they’re not compelling enough on their own to convince people to switch. Under-screen fingerprint sensors on Android phones have gone from mediocre to great in just a few short years. Telephoto lenses are folded into periscopes that run along the lengths of the phone for even longer zooms. Screens are interrupted by only tiny little punch holes for selfie cameras (or, in some cases, not interrupted at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8cgbX"&gt;These are all niceties that aren’t a huge loss if you’re an iPhone user — well worth the tradeoff for the ecosystem, hardware quality, and performance you get with the average iPhone. They come first to Android because the pressure to compete against other Android phones is so intense that any little advantage matters. If there are two new phones on the store shelf that are very nearly the same but one has an always-on screen, well, that’s the one you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABsfZ0"&gt;iOS and Android are not at all the same, though. So when it comes to bringing these smaller hardware features to the iPhone, I can’t help but think that the competitive pressure Apple feels most urgently isn’t the smartphones you see on the store shelf. It’s the iPhone you’ve got in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s ‘California Streaming’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Holds Event Virtually" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YJDjIb6_70pdn3aNO-UrqRaF0PY=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855414/1221930031.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m80YT8"&gt;It’s September, which means iPhone season is just nearly here. The rumor mill has been spinning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;highly anticipated iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, a third generation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and the potential for new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;. A new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;bezel-less iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; is also a possibility, as is the official release of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HiZ05"&gt;Since Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;sent out the invite&lt;/a&gt; for its “California Streaming” event, we’ve been able to take guesses at what hidden meanings there might be to decipher from the night sky and the illuminated Apple logo, but just when does it actually get underway and where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MHCz0z"&gt;What time does the iPhone 13 event start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6Hw1Q3"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event will go live at 10AM PT / 1PM ET today, Tuesday, September 14th. Like all Apple keynotes since the beginning of the pandemic, it will likely amount to a lengthy infomercial recorded and streamed from the Apple Park campus, with everyone from Tim Cook on down presenting. We expect the recording to become available shortly after its debut, too, in the event you miss out on the prerecorded livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UFZ2Pg"&gt;Where can I watch the Apple event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0CHXFL"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22663255%2Fapple-event-iphone-13-live-stream-watch-start-time" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its site&lt;/a&gt;, per usual, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvGOlAkLSLw"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve embedded the YouTube video above, so you can set a reminder or watch live from this very post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGebcM"&gt;Also, be sure to keep tabs on our live blog if you can’t watch the video while at work or if you prefer to follow along with our editors as announcements are made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stop and update your iPhone to iOS 14.8 right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tD4CoZE3XDP5N7N3rFYqvkgwSSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69854057/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vNbyFA"&gt;Apple has released a suite of new updates for &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212804"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212806"&gt;watchOS&lt;/a&gt; to fix a bug that &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/"&gt;security researchers at Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt; say was very likely exploited to allow government agencies to install spyware into the phones of journalists, lawyers, and activists. The researchers say the bug allowed for a “zero-click” install (meaning the target didn’t have to do anything to be infected) of the Pegasus spyware, which is reportedly capable of stealing data, passwords, and activating a phone’s microphone or camera. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;our explainer of Pegusus here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghtgyJ"&gt;Given the severity of the exploit, you should update to iOS 14.8, macOS Big Sur 11.6, and watchOS 7.6.2 as soon as you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDzdFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s update page says it’s “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11sjdQ"&gt;We heard about the exploit in August, &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/bahrain-hacks-activists-with-nso-group-zero-click-iphone-exploits/"&gt;when Citizen Lab reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had been successfully used against phones running iOS 14.6 (released in May). Citizen Lab also said the vulnerability, which it codenamed “ForcedEntry,” seemed to match the behavior of an exploit Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2021/07/forensic-methodology-report-how-to-catch-nso-groups-pegasus/"&gt;wrote about in July&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the security researchers wrote that it was made possible by a bug in Apple’s CoreGraphics system, and happened when the phone tried to use a function related to GIFs, after it received a text message containing a malicious file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY3uHD"&gt;However, even with that info, it could be difficult to pin down exactly what was happening without access to the infected files themselves. &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild"&gt;According to Citizen Lab&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered files while re-analyzing a backup from an activist’s hacked phone. The files appeared to be GIFs sent as SMS attachments, but were actually PSDs and PDFs. (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212807"&gt;Apple’s update notes&lt;/a&gt; say that the issue occurred when processing a maliciously crafted PDF.) Citizen Lab suspected they could’ve been related to Pegasus, so it sent the files to Apple on September 7th. Apple quickly released the software updates patching the bug on September 13th, and thanked Citizen Lab in a statement for “completing the very difficult work of obtaining a sample of this exploit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IweTQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS 14.8 is seemingly only focused on security&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TEuK8F"&gt;Some of Monday’s updates also fix a second security issue with WebKit for iOS and macOS Big Sur (it isn’t mentioned in the release notes for Catalina). While it’s unclear if it’s related to NSO’s exploits — its discovery is attributed to “an anonymous researcher” instead of Citizen Lab, and it’s in a different part of the system — Apple still says that it “may have been actively exploited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWQTAy"&gt;Such an urgent security issue explains why we’re seeing a new update to iOS just a day before an Apple event, where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;expected to announced new phones&lt;/a&gt; that will probably never run this version of the OS. Still, there have been rumors about an iOS 14.8 release &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/09/ios-14-8-release-date-information-rumor/"&gt;since early August&lt;/a&gt;, but given that Monday’s release seems to only deal with the security issues discovered in September, it’s possible we’ll see at least one more iOS 14 release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="55m3eu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keep your devices up-to-date&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLzesV"&gt;CoreGraphics’ PDF rendering seems to have been problematic recently when it comes to security. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212601"&gt;iOS 14.7 also included a fix&lt;/a&gt; for a seemingly separate issue with the system, which could also lead to arbitrary code execution. WebKit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;recently had&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;few updates&lt;/a&gt; to fix security issues that Apple says “may have been actively exploited.” When news of the CoreGraphics exploit broke in August, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was working on improving security for iOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaocFK"&gt;All of this serves as a reminder about how important it is to keep all your devices up-to-date. While you hopefully never find yourself on the bad side of a government using advanced spyware, it’s still a good idea to make sure that your device isn’t vulnerable to widely-reported security exploits. Thankfully, Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/06/07/apple-introduces-android-fragmentation-with-ios-15/"&gt;planning on letting&lt;/a&gt; users install security updates for iOS 14 without having to upgrade to iOS 15, which could be useful for any future fixes. For the time being, though, get all your devices updated as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1LRoB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 13th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added quote from Apple’s statement thanking Citizen Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $850 once you add it to your cart, where additional savings will automatically apply. This matches the all-time low for this popular entry-level laptop. The 512GB configuration is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in all three colorways for $1,100, a discount of $150 that automatically applies at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRJZQQ"&gt;Although retailers like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are selling the base 256GB MacBook Air and upgraded, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; model at regular price, we have seen them drop the pricing in the past to match Amazon’s discounts. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — bringing it down to $1,150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded version of the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is also $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532652589677821#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for a final sale price of $1,350.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in two configurations at Amazon: one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999, and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. Amazon is currently offering the space gray configuration with an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FZV45H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $2,285&lt;/a&gt;, a $114 discount. There are other configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,645 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up the 256GB model for a historical low of $600 (discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpqfyJ"&gt;As for the 512GB model, we have seen retailers such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; offer it for $100 off its usual $899 price point, but there are currently no sizable discounts to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hasn’t decided whether to appeal the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd07Y2G1J0y_cyh8iC04BbcEFWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852281/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyYrSd"&gt;Apple is still weighing whether to appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;last week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;antitrust ruling&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. In a call with reporters, a representative said Apple was still evaluating its legal options and had not made a decision about its next steps. The position contrasts sharply with Epic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it intends to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpwrPk"&gt;Apple reiterated a position it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;took last week&lt;/a&gt;, casting the ruling as a near-total victory. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dismissed nine of Epic’s 10 claims, including ones that would have required iOS to allow third-party app stores and payment processors. She ordered Epic to pay damages for breaching its developer contract. Apple also doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;return Epic’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the iOS App Store, and it can choose to terminate other Epic-affiliated developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3O8ah"&gt;Apple hasn’t taken a position on whether it will ban any Epic-related apps beyond &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Asked for comment, a representative said Apple is still looking at its options regarding Epic’s future on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm8ccl"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite"&gt;Epic said Apple&lt;/a&gt; might cut off support for the widely used Unreal Engine on iOS — a nuclear option in the conflict between them. That seems theoretically possible now, but Apple has publicly taken a measured tone so far, saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;“welcome” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back into the App Store&lt;/a&gt; if it removed its non-Apple in-app purchase option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XsB9s"&gt;While Apple won most claims, it was found to be violating California’s Unfair Competition Law with its anti-steering rules. A court order will require it to let developers link to alternate payment options outside their apps, although they still need to use Apple’s in-app purchase system within them. That order will take effect in December if Apple doesn’t appeal and win a delay of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtwMqZ"&gt;For now Apple says it’s studying how it could change its rules to comply with the order, which it characterized as line-editing Apple’s terms of service. But unsurprisingly, it doesn’t have any answers to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What comes next for the App Store?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i46PCnuYdn54rk3JYSgtw-kZ6-0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852010/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vxzkF"&gt;On September 10th, a verdict finally arrived in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and it has left the App Store model in a precarious state. Epic wanted to do away with the system entirely, breaking Apple’s control over software distribution on iOS — but the ruling stopped well short of that. Instead, we got an ambiguously worded injunction that seems to open the door to developers skirting Apple’s commission system — or at least making it easier to use non-Apple payment methods outside their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2bJ1Y"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, Apple pushed to cast it as a victory — and Epic seemed sure it had lost. It’s understandable: until we see how Apple reacts and how the court looks on Epic’s recent appeal, it’s hard to know for sure what the injunction will actually mean. The ruling could be a significant leak in Apple’s carefully controlled ecosystem. But for that to happen, Epic and its allies will need a lot to break in their favor, both inside the courtroom and out. There are still lots of places for Apple to fight, and lots of ways to pare back developers’ small glimmer of a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLtFXm"&gt;Here are the four most important questions from those fights, the questions we’ll be watching particularly closely in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LUEC9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much freedom does this ruling actually give developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jos2mP"&gt;For all the complexities of the case, the actual order issued by the court is simple. It zeroes in on a single sentence in Apple’s App Store guidelines, which Apple is now forbidden from enforcing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfyla"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIjpkc"&gt;The one thing that’s clear is that developers have to be allowed some way to forward users to outside payment systems. But as my boss Nilay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;points out here&lt;/a&gt;, the “buttons” clause is ambiguous and could let developers make those systems look a lot like Apple’s official option, even if they open Safari or another app for the actual payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ePca6"&gt;Enforcing that interpretation will take a lot of legal work from developers and a lot of developer-friendly rulings in court. From the other side, there will be lots of opportunities for Apple to chip away at the injunction’s force. It’s hard to say how interested courts will be in defending it. But if they aren’t, the App Store could still be a very risky place for developers using alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMkF8u"&gt;In particular, there’s a real threat that Apple will still be able to impose the so-called Apple tax on whatever new payment system is allowed. In theory, the App Store’s commissions are levied to support the entire store, not just the payment system, and in her ruling, the judge considers the idea of Apple allowing alternate payment methods but requiring the same 30 percent cut via audits or other systems. (My colleague Adi explores this in the seventh section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;her deep dive on the ruling&lt;/a&gt;, under the heading “Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges.”) If that’s borne out in an actual legal order, the door would slam shut on alternate payment systems pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EDQ92r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will Apple change its App Store rules in response to this ruling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wlIOuT"&gt;The other half of the equation is Apple itself, which is almost certainly going to change its App Store rules if the order stands, if only to change the anti-steering clause. The specific rule about referring to outside payment systems is out, but Apple still has broad legal authority to write its own rules for the App Store. So what new rule will the company write to replace the old one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU0qdE"&gt;In particular, there are lots of ways Apple could discourage outside payments without banning them entirely. There’s the commission rate idea we’ve already discussed, but Apple could also place restrictions on how outside payment links are presented. The company could require specific price differentials between Apple’s IAP system and any competitors, and it could require the systems to be presented side by side — whatever the company thinks will pass muster with the court and keep developers using the Apple system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HcdZh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will external payments look like on the App Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vEXiBf"&gt;When the dust has settled on both those questions, developers will be left with some alternatives to Apple’s built-in payment system. It could be a simple button or a maze of links and forms — and a lot will be riding on where external payments land on that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flmTxP"&gt;The specific numbers on this are important, since developers will be balancing the cost of friction against the extra money they get from sidestepping Apple. On the face of it, a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style app will get an extra 30 cents for every dollar of in-app purchases that don’t go through Apple’s system (minus whatever fees the cost of providing the alternative service eats up). But it also seems likely that leaving Apple’s walled garden will add friction to the process, which means there will be fewer overall dollars being spent through the alternate path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McEMuJ"&gt;But how many fewer? If you lose four out of every ten customers by kicking to an outside payment system, then there’s no point putting it in place — but if it’s only two, you’ll still come out ahead. The specific UX details will make an enormous difference in determining that attrition rate: How large is the button? How many extra taps? Can Safari force you to enter in your credit card number each time you make a new purchase? Each extra step will nudge developers back toward IAP, and make Apple’s App Store profits that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UoerZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of the App Store will move to external payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WrL9vF"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s dream in launching this lawsuit was to break Apple’s control over software on iOS. That didn’t happen, and as long as the ruling holds up on appeal, Apple’s control over iOS looks more solid than ever. Under the rules of the injunction, the only way Sweeney can hurt Apple is if developers vote with their feet and leave, taking their commissions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsbZED"&gt;Apple is particularly dependent on big developers like Epic, which have enough profits to pay 30 percent commission rates and generate the bulk of the App Store’s revenue. Crucially, the court’s injunction isn’t limited to games or in-app payments, so there’s no telling how much of the developer base will leave Apple’s payment system. If that happens, Apple could be forced to switch to give up the commission system for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4h2Rx"&gt;So far, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;doesn’t look like that’s happening&lt;/a&gt;. The response from most developers has been noncommittal, and some already seem to think it won’t make sense for them to pursue payments outside the Apple system. But with the actual changes still months away (and already under appeal), it makes sense for developers to wait and see whether the new system is worth pursuing. But after the many possibilities opened up on Friday, it seems hard to believe none of them will be interested in exploring their options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2qn1u"&gt;If you’re an iPhone owner, it’s very possible you’re considering trading up to the latest model, which (when this article was last updated) is likely to be the iPhone 13. However, if your current iPhone is still in good shape, you may be wondering about what to do with it. Should you sell it? Trade it in? Give it away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXGfsW"&gt;Well — any of the above. This guide will walk you through the process of preparing your old phone, and what your best alternatives are for disposing of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y9FVIs"&gt;Are you transferring to a new iPhone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DHovgw"&gt;If you’re transferring to a new iPhone — or even if you’re not — you probably want to back up your phone before you do anything else (see below). Backing up to iCloud is probably easiest — and it also gives you the option of transferring your data either directly from your old phone to your new phone, or transferring your data from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NF8gC"&gt;Once you’ve done that, then go ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20871131/data-transfer-new-iphone-11-pro-max-ios-how-to"&gt;copy all your data to your new phone&lt;/a&gt;. If you want, you can also try going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone.” Depending on the version of iOS you’re running, you may have access to a wizard called “Prepare for New iPhone,” which will run you through all the steps necessary to transfer your data to your new phone. (It will also let you check your phone’s trade-in Status.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is back up to iCloud." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sugnJrj_qQoBajv2ry2xUaLYbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838046/IMG_D79739CF9DAE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is backed up to iCloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtRfDLKH_olAw2egNZ1dIhjsZ5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838053/IMG_D831063B05A8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PMsgrZ"&gt;Back up your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffuR80"&gt;As mentioned above, it’s a good idea to have a current backup of all of your data saved on iCloud, your laptop, or any other local / cloud storage.  Backing up your phone on iCloud Backup is probably the easiest. If it’s been a while and you want to make sure backup is switched on in your phone’s iCloud settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLcQ1"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-iphone-iph3ecf67d29/ios"&gt;back up your iPhone to a computer&lt;/a&gt;: either to your Mac by using your Finder (if your Mac is using a macOS version before 10.15, you’ll use iTunes) or to a Windows PC (again, using iTunes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6qWjaR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge guide to the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17828022/iphone-user-guide-how-to-ios-tips"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3W7ILm"&gt;Wipe your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfFOB"&gt;When you’re sure that all of your data is stored — and you’ve transferred all your data to your new phone — it’s time to wipe your old phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzHI1"&gt;First, you have to make sure you’ve gotten rid of a few identifiable features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="g1y20x"&gt;Then you need to sign out from your Apple ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;	Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;	Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;	You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;	Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper right corner, and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1ucZCq"&gt;Finally, get ready to erase it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone”  and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piUZnlaqfVeSDb64HBCoO6H3iqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838056/IMG_C0157C8B9455_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll get one last chance to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMHILye-QLRmP11cto9ODExlSS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838059/IMG_BB1A5D632ACF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get one last chance to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XBA7Rz"&gt;Clean it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqdesG"&gt;Before you even think of selling your phone, you need to make sure it’s looking its best. Remove the case and / or any stickers, and assess the damage you can see, including scratches or dents, which you’ll have to mention when selling the phone. Then, clean your phone using a screen wipe or screen cleaner. (You might want to leave your screen protector on if it’s in good condition.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZfhwf"&gt;It’s also a good idea to take photos of your phone. You’ll need them for the listing when selling the phone online; in addition, they’re useful in case the recipient reports further damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cNdcWI"&gt;Sell your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tUf4or"&gt;There are a variety of places where you can try to sell your used phone. A few of those are listed here, along with the estimates I got for an iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0Rtla"&gt;The first thing you might think of is to trade your phone in to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This may be especially useful if you haven’t bought your new iPhone yet, and you want to see if you can save a little on your new device. If you’ve already bought your new phone, then you can go to Apple’s trade-in page and see what your phone is worth. Note that in return you’ll be getting a gift card for future Apple purchases. The quote for the iPhone 11 was $390 in trade-in value at the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. An iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB received a quote for $401.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. My iPhone 11 was given an estimated value of $360 (increased to $400 if traded in for specific tech products).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. The iPhone 11 got prices from two vendors; the highest was $455.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YPx3L"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. The average price that an iPhone 11 with 256GB could be sold for was quoted as $543.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;, and the subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/phoneswap/"&gt;r/Phoneswap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appleswap/"&gt;r/Appleswap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/"&gt;r/Hardwareswap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3t6ZHP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, there are other things you can do with it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rx0YPR"&gt;Play it safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t0XZEr"&gt;Most of these transactions take place via mail. However, if you decide to do the transaction in person, it’s safest to meet in a public place — and these days, if you’re at all concerned about infection, to either do it outdoors in a park or other public space, or in a cafe or other indoor venue that follows current safety recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eicK6g"&gt;And if you decide you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;there are other things you can do with it&lt;/a&gt;, including using it as a webcam or letting it be your kids’ first grown-up phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhSxUq"&gt;Whatever you decide to do with your old phone, just make sure you’re happy with your new phone first. You don’t want to have to return that brand-new phone because of problems (or because you just don’t like it) and suddenly find yourself desperately scrounging around for a temporary substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0PHLx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 10th, 2021, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on January 14th, 2020 and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services and websites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2WnJedXB1sVhcLhp4xichPG_Tk=/166x0:1123x638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851117/Screenshot_2021_09_10_7.38.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlLw7g"&gt;Apple’s first fall event is coming up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Tuesday, September 14th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;, right around the time when the company typically introduces its latest version of the iPhone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;Like last year’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, Tuesday’s announcements will be entirely digital, in the slick, over-produced style that’s become Apple’s trademark during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Du1zo1"&gt;Rumors suggest a potentially less dramatic set of announcements compared to the iPhone 12’s radical flat-edged design. It does seem like the Apple Watch and AirPods could get some serious attention, though, even if the iPhone 13 looks more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0h080"&gt;Keep reading below for a roundup of everything we expect to see at the event, including some long-shot surprises Apple could have in store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8833rrFzFziADRLiBLUiwc7W2Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023082/vpavic_4279_20201107_0180.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ewr5Bs"&gt;An iPhone 13 with a familiar design and maybe a new nighttime camera trick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEvbK"&gt;Rumors suggest that the iPhone 13 will look a lot like the iPhone 12 but with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;a possibly smaller notch and high refresh rate displays&lt;/a&gt; on all or most models. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; seem to be in agreement that the new iPhone will receive iterative if helpful changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBVbq"&gt;Those could include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display like Apple uses to provide variable refresh rates on the Apple Watch. The new phone hardware may also include &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/04/rumors-iphone-13-to-feature-larger-wireless-charging-coil-alongside-stronger-magsafe-magnets/"&gt;stronger magnets, a larger charging coil for MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;always-on display&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/iphone-13-fewer-storage-options-and-new-colors/"&gt;new colors and fewer storage options&lt;/a&gt;. A new A-series processor is naturally in the cards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXLloq"&gt;The star of Apple’s iPhones, the cameras, will likely also receive an upgrade with the iPhone 13. Improved performance for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;the ultrawide camera&lt;/a&gt;, better optical zoom for video recording, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates"&gt;ProRes support, and a Portrait Mode for video&lt;/a&gt; have all been rumored. The other possible addition is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/"&gt;astrophotography capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to compete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203782/google-removes-wide-angle-astrophotography-pixel-4a-5g-5"&gt;a similar feature&lt;/a&gt; Google has offered in the past. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840?s=20"&gt;An event announcement video&lt;/a&gt; tweeted by Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak featuring a dramatic pan up to a starry night sky may have added more fuel to that specific fire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g1aETW"&gt;A flat-edged Apple Watch Series 7 with a bigger screen and the same health features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MeuKUr"&gt;While the iPhone 13 is staying consistent, it seems the Apple Watch Series 7 might get a more involved redesign. The rounded body Apple’s used since the introduction of its smartwatch is rumored to be replaced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;with flatter displays and edges&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The change sounds similar to the shift Apple made from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Grz5"&gt;Earlier this year, news broke that Apple was also possibly introducing an entirely separate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;more rugged, extreme sports-friendly version of the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors have coalesced around the iPhone 12-inspired Series 7 since but not this sports version. We’ll have to wait and see if it arrives this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjio0g"&gt;Other improvements to the mainline Series 7 could include a faster processor and overall bigger watches at 41mm and 45mm (up from 40mm and 44mm), thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;a combination of larger displays, smaller bezels, or both&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. It’s not clear if that would impact the compatibility of the many watch bands Apple has sold over the years, but here’s hoping it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yyugr"&gt;Those hardware changes will allow for new watchfaces, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman, but likely not new health features. Despite rumors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532916/apple-watch-series-7-features-blood-glucose-body-temperature-extreme-sports-edition-se-2"&gt;body temperature and blood glucose tracking&lt;/a&gt;, now it seems Apple might leave those additions for future models. Complicating matters further, though, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly resolved production delays&lt;/a&gt; for the new Watch, some versions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?s=20"&gt;could arrive late or in smaller quantities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="F57Mhj"&gt;Third-generation AirPods with some AirPods Pro-inspired looks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="imEUed"&gt;The entry-level third-generation AirPods are also rumored to be in line for a makeover. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;Early word in 2020&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a design that takes cues from the AirPods Pro, minus the earbuds’ swappable rubber tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdxNzc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Further corroboration in 2021&lt;/a&gt; suggests the same. It seems you can expect shorter stems, rounded earpieces, and a squatter wireless charging case that might have a 20 percent larger battery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PineLeaks/status/1435302679014739970?s=20"&gt;according to Pine Leaks&lt;/a&gt;. In general, the new AirPods might finally look a bit less like headphones with the wires cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="qwruU3"&gt;The launch of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, with a few ingredients missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1qfN18"&gt;Apple is expected to announce the launch dates for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey, though the company has confirmed some features will arrive late or in beta form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4DRGp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, which finally brings proper, moveable widgets to the iPad for the first time along with other improvements, will likely arrive in late September with the iPhone 13. Notable upgrades include Focus Modes that create approved notification and app lists for specific settings like work or personal time, a dramatic redesign of Safari (that’s now settled into something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;a bit more familiar&lt;/a&gt;), new FaceTime layouts and audio improvements, a possible future source of controversy in digital IDs, and yet another tweak to multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWlynE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8 is also expected in the fall&lt;/a&gt; with more modest upgrades. Along with support for Focus Modes and new digital keys and IDs, watchOS 8 brings new watchfaces (including a nice photo one), new exercise types (pilates time to shine), and a mindfulness app to Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7omTiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; could come later in the fall (perhaps timed to the launch of a new Mac computer). The new desktop OS continues to pick up features from Apple’s mobile OSes, like support for Shortcuts, AirPlay, and helpful changes to FaceTime and Messages. The most exciting new Monterey feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, allows for seamless control of an iPad with the mouse and keyboard already attached to your Mac. That includes easily dragging and dropping files from iPad to Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNWBKl"&gt;Unfortunately, Universal Control might not be there at launch. The feature has yet to be included in a beta, and Apple has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;announced delays for SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s take on group watch plug-ins and Discord screen sharing that became all the rage early on in the pandemic. Luckily, other features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;previously limited to Apple’s M1-based devices&lt;/a&gt; — like Live Text — are coming to older Intel machines. You win some, and you lose some, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eyTC3Z"&gt;Possibly a longer wait for new iPad Minis, iPads, and Macs of all stripes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7qvE"&gt;It really seems like updates to the entry-level iPad and the long-ignored iPad Mini are happening; the question is when. Apple could reserve the devices for a later event in October rather than hang with a new iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFHF0J"&gt;The new iPad Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;expected to receive the flat-edged design&lt;/a&gt; that’s apparently sweeping through Apple’s entire product line, along the usual processor improvements, a larger screen between 8.5 to 9 inches, no home button, and a Touch ID sensor built directly into the power button. The entry-level iPad changes are expected to be more minor — thinner bezels and body and the inclusion of an A13 Bionic chip, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/20/new-ipad-mini-exclusive-a15-processor-usb-c/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeRsUa"&gt;Even less likely are new Macs, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;a new Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;Macbook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Apple will probably want to schedule some separate time to announce whatever it has planned for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;next version of the M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; and the new designs that could come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0Crt2"&gt;That’s a whole lot of possible announcements, not even taking into account a tease for longer-term Apple projects like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;continued exploration of AR and VR&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to hear about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic has appealed Friday’s ruling in the Epic v. Apple case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSH7yiCuSacSvN4rUhSdE0WOAjQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69848504/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qx655b"&gt;Epic Games has filed an appeal to a Friday’s ruling in its lawsuit against Apple, calling on a higher court to reexamine the case and overturn the judge’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29aZkr"&gt;“Notice is hereby given that Epic Games, Inc.... appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the final Judgment entered on September 10, 2021,” &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal"&gt;the document reads&lt;/a&gt;. Few details are given about the legal basis for Epic’s appeal, but it is likely to continue to press on the federal antitrust allegations dismissed by the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIsOt"&gt;At trial, Epic argued Apple had a monopoly because of how it requires developers to use its payments system for in-game purchases. But Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled Friday that Epic should pay damages to Apple for violating rules around its in-app purchasing system, while undoing Apple’s most restrictive rules on steering customers to alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG3pML"&gt;Most notably, the judge found that Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;failed to make the case&lt;/a&gt; for Apple as a monopoly in the mobile gaming marketplace, which she ultimately found was the relevant market for the company’s claims. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” Judge Rogers wrote — but said the antitrust claims failed in part “because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first iPhone with 1TB of storage is reportedly coming Tuesday</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IJGCgc"&gt;Days before Apple’s California Streaming event on September 14th, a new investor report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says he expects the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max to each have a 1TB storage configuration (h/t &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-iphone-13-to-drop-64gb-storage-size-pro-models-to-offer-1tb-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Kuo also says the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will have storage configurations of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, but no 64GB option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybhuHK"&gt;Kuo also said he expects Apple to reveal AirPods 3 at Tuesday’s event, but that Apple will probably keep the AirPods 2 available. He cautions that the iPhone 13 could be affected by supply chain shortages, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;has been previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, but expects there will be limited impact on iPhone 13 shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTkCLy"&gt;Previous leaks and rumors have pointed to an iPhone 13 lineup that will include four models in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;same sizes as last year’s models&lt;/a&gt;. The new phones are expected to have improved cameras that include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618070/apple-2021-iphone-13-camera-features-video-portrait-prores-ai-filters"&gt;video portrait mode and an astrophotography mode&lt;/a&gt;, an improved ultrawide lens and a better optical zoom for video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH8z5A"&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;rumors around the Apple Watch 7&lt;/a&gt; are predicting a faster processor and a new hardware design, including larger screens and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;new watchfaces&lt;/a&gt;. And the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt; iPad Mini is expected&lt;/a&gt; to get a big redesign, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hehdwZ"&gt;The fall event gets underway at 1PM ET on September 14th, and will be a virtual event &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F12%2F22670072%2Fapple-iphone-13-pro-models-1tb-storage-kuo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming from Apple Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
