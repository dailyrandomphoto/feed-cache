    <title>Apple rehires former HomePod engineer to get its software back on track</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sheL58"&gt;Apple has hired a former HomePod engineer, Afrooz Family, to head up the team developing HomePod software, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/apple-hires-new-homepod-software-head-as-it-takes-on-amazon-echo?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which could signal a renewed effort from Apple to make the HomePod more competitive. The company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679870/new-apple-homekit-features-homepod-mini"&gt;HomePod software version 15&lt;/a&gt; in September, bringing some welcome features like the ability to use one or a pair of HomePod Mini speakers as the default with an Apple TV 4K. But Apple’s smart speaker line faces stiff competition, particularly from Amazon’s and Google’s speakers that are equipped with their smart assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPl4RF"&gt;Family left Apple in 2016, where he was a senior audio engineer, to co-found audio company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsyngspace.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22727249%2Fapple-homepod-software-chief-afrooz-family" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Syng&lt;/a&gt; with ex-Apple designer Christopher Stringer. (A &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; article about Syng described Family as the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4a88a13-47c3-4bb4-a627-704fdf0c392b"&gt;“secret weapon.”&lt;/a&gt;) Syng’s claim to fame is its Cell Alpha connected speaker, which offers spatial audio in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439925/syng-cell-alpha-wi-fi-speaker-apple-designer-death-star-triphonic"&gt;Death Star-like design&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes with a steep $1,799 price tag. Family left Syng earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWEIYP"&gt;The first HomePod, which was released in 2018, was lauded for its sound quality but was criticized for its high price, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;Apple discontinued it in March&lt;/a&gt;. The company released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;cheaper and smaller HomePod Mini last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJsjrv"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music might be coming to PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJd5IDl5xln_vvgQMbYd-9yMqaY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996911/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPD4mi"&gt;Spotify has been a music streaming option on the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;since it launched in November&lt;/a&gt;, giving you the option to listen to your favorite music when playing games. Soon, though, the console might get support for another service: Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CNfL8"&gt;The first clue came earlier this week when a Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;posted a picture&lt;/a&gt; of Apple Music appearing in the PS5’s music menu. The option apparently showed up after they made a new account and tried to link it with Spotify. It seems the app didn’t work, though — the Reddit user also shared a photo of a message that said, “This app is playable only on PS4,” which &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; says is a standard error message when an app isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QIB-lyPsDb0MJy9raBtK9bB3kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927945/lji5211pmws71.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link" target="_blank"&gt;u/HOLYWARS1990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Reddit user’s photo of Apple Music on PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XvArdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; said it was also &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"&gt;able to see the Apple Music option&lt;/a&gt; when making a new US account, though it wasn’t able to reproduce doing so. The Apple Music option didn’t appear when I tried making a new US account while writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydz91X"&gt;The inconsistency of the Apple Music option suggests that the Reddit user and &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; may have gotten an early peek at something that Sony and Apple have in the works. The two companies worked together recently on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588577/ps5-sony-apple-tv-plus-six-month-trial-subscription"&gt;Apple TV Plus promotion for PS5 owners&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems there’s a relationship there. Apple brought Apple Music to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231790/samsung-smart-tv-apple-music-app-available"&gt;Samsung smart TVs&lt;/a&gt; last year, showing that it is willing to expand the app’s availability beyond Apple platforms. And the app is appearing just days before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple’s October 18th event&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a potential venue for Apple and Sony to announce that the app is coming to PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdqOap"&gt;Sony and Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pressure mounts on Amazon and App Store discrimination in new bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary&amp;amp;nbsp;Hearing Examining Texas Abortion Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EAgY24Qll4PShIsoqKrUHnwBqfQ=/2x0:4325x2882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69996120/1235582856.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23lhwP"&gt;After months of hearings and negotiations, pressure is growing in the Senate to pass new laws banning online platforms from giving preference to their own products and services over those of their competitors. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced plans to introduce a nondiscrimination bill that could reshape Amazon’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nC5IJK"&gt;The American Choice and Innovation Online Act, led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would prevent platforms like Amazon, Apple, and Google from using their dominance to disadvantage other companies and competitors that use their platforms. In June, House lawmakers voted out a bill sharing the same name from the Judiciary Committee. Klobuchar’s Senate version isn’t identical to the House’s, but shares similar language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EOmJW"&gt;This announcement follows a Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Amazon used marketplace search data to copy popular products and manipulate results favoring the company’s own knockoff products. A Thursday &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also showed that the company places its products ahead of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v09bTW"&gt;For years, third-party sellers have accused Amazon of similar behavior. These accusations were part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;a yearslong House antitrust investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Amazon and other tech giants by lawmakers, spurring the original bipartisan bill in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgMFrj"&gt;“When dominant tech companies exclude rivals &amp;amp; kill competition, it hurts small businesses and can increase costs for YOU,” Klobuchar said in a tweet on Thursday. “My new bipartisan legislation with [Grassley] will establish new rules of the road to prevent large companies from boxing out their smaller competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReUveI"&gt;Outside of Amazon, the bill could also change how Apple and Google run their app stores, banning the companies from giving preference to their own first-party apps and software. Earlier this year, Apple was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered to allow app developers&lt;/a&gt; to send iOS users to payment options outside of those offered by the iPhone manufacturer in a case brought by Epic Games. Google is facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;a similar suit&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2nh35"&gt;As of publication, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1448694019631063045?s=20"&gt;said that at least five Senate Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have signed onto the legislation, including Sens. Cynthia Lummis (WY), Josh Hawley (MO), Lindsey Graham (SC), and John Kennedy (LA). This bipartisan support marks a significant step forward for lawmakers seeking to regulate online marketplaces, showing that both Republicans and Democrats are willing to work together to spur competition in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnFVWe"&gt;“Many ‘critics’ called our bipartisan antitrust bils ‘Democrat bills,’” Buck said in a tweet. “That was false then, and it’s false now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJYHZV"&gt;Despite the measure’s broad congressional support, trade groups like Chamber of Progress issued statements Thursday suggesting that the bill will hurt customer experiences online, not enhance them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ueilx"&gt;“Preventing Amazon from selling Amazon Basics and banning Google’s maps from its search results isn’t going to do anything to make the Internet better for families,” Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress said in a Thursday statement. “This is like calling a car mechanic to fix your laptop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsjtWs"&gt;The Chamber of Progress coalition partners with tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJJNn"&gt;Pressure is mounting for Congress to act on online marketplaces and counterfeit products as well. Last week, House lawmakers introduced &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-117hr5502ih.pdf"&gt;the INFORM Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require platforms like Amazon to verify the identities of high-volume sellers in order to curb the sale of knockoff products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEgpTz"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c81HwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3T9jl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends AirPods Pro repair program for crackling or ANC issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd4XpFdUwrRRGx7eXmiuL17ewU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992754/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro, first released in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRcibj"&gt;Apple has quietly extended a repair program for the AirPods Pro that offers free repairs or replacements for earbuds that have issues with noise cancellation or static. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-extends-airpods-pro-repair-program/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) were first to spot the change to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues"&gt;support page for the repair program&lt;/a&gt;, which now notes that the program covers affected AirPods Pro for three years after their first retail sale, rather than two. The page appears to have been updated at the beginning of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzcWg"&gt;The support program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542846/apple-airpods-pro-repair-recall-program-noise-cancellation-static"&gt;originally introduced in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, one year after the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;release of the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. It meant that Apple’s repair program was introduced at the exact point that the warranty on launch units was set to expire. With the extension of the repair program to three years, AirPods Pro bought at launch should now be covered right up until October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvyRXC"&gt;As a reminder, Apple says it will fix the following issues with the AirPods Pro: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8TjET"&gt;Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dz2WK"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md31O7"&gt;If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you now have a whole extra year to get off your butt and get a free fix as part of the repair program, which, in our experience, often means Apple giving you an on-the-spot replacement pair to take home. To do so, Apple says you should contact its support team or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or else make an appointment at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpNvqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPKFnB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iOS app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days. Last spring, iOS 14.5 introduced a new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency that may have made its users happier but did not endear Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is still available in iOS 15, along with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/"&gt;some new privacy features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The version that first appeared in iOS 14.5 allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you don’t have to do anything; you are automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond, or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out. There have been no such problems reported recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzW1Zi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to acknowledge that iOS 15 has shipped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beif1eQuMH4VMcv6Jati_-qdTfw=/195x0:1503x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991001/Screenshot_2021_10_13_12.58.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Astropad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9Ybrs"&gt;Astropad’s Luna Display is a handy way to turn an iPad or another Mac into a wireless external monitor for Apple’s computers. Now the company has updated its wireless dongles &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-5-0-windows/"&gt;to include support for Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;, a solid step forward for the company after Apple’s Sidecar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;made its functionality a built-in part&lt;/a&gt; of iPadOS and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQL3ob"&gt;Windows support is included in Luna Display 5.0 and requires “Windows 10 64-bit, Build 1809 or later” and at least iPadOS 12.1, according to Astropad. That means modern Windows devices and iPads can work together in a variety of configurations, including using the Apple Pencil along with an iPad as a very expensive drawing tablet for your Windows machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zHLEKudq02qN_7p4fS1SjB3FMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924633/lunadisplaywindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Astropad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad’s touch controls, gestures, and Pencil support all translate over to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EIEzg5"&gt;The company is making Luna Display for Windows available in two types of connectors for plugging into your Windows devices, either USB-C and HDMI. Owners of the older USB-C Luna Display are also able to update to add support for Windows starting today. For what it’s worth, Astropad says the restructuring it did for its 5.0 release also means setting up Luna Display on M1 Macs should be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfXNZZ"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/23/16184080/astro-hq-luna-turns-ipad-into-wireless-display"&gt;first launched Luna Display in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, about two years before Apple “sherlocked” it with the Sidecar feature added in macOS Catalina. Not long after, the company updated Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20920510/luna-display-mac-to-mac-mode-sidecar-sherlocked-apple"&gt;to work wirelessly between Macs&lt;/a&gt; as a response to Apple’s move. “Apple zigs, we zag,” Astropad CEO Matt Ronge &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mronge/status/1184881856598237184?s=20"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRMXdf"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/"&gt;has been fairly open&lt;/a&gt; about its experience of being copied, including suggesting it was &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/blessing-in-disguise/"&gt;a blessing in disguise&lt;/a&gt; when it announced it was testing Windows support in beta (other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124116/apple-developers-sherlocked-blix-bluemail-anonymous-email-feature"&gt;preferred taking legal action&lt;/a&gt;). The Kickstarter for its new Luna Display for Windows dongles &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display-for-windows/posts"&gt;launched on September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; and was successfully funded just an hour later. People clearly want this functionality for Windows, and now Astropad is finally offering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;Luna Display is $129 for Mac or PC, with port options for USB-C, HDMI, and Mini DisplayPort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3N85v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooSC9y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 officially ditches the hidden diagnostic port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUh-TcvuezoCV_LzFTHy5kW7_uk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990785/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d22oPe"&gt;The Apple Watch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt; has been a mysterious part of the wearable lineup since its first model, but the new Series 7 officially ditches the six-pin port entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RqFb0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-watch-series-7-lacks-diagnostic-port/"&gt;First noted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of a port can be seen when you remove the bottom strap from an Apple Watch Series 7 — the company has removed the hidden plate and the port behind it. Intended for internal use for diagnostics, the port wasn’t officially acknowledged on Apple’s website or documentation. But the diagnostic port briefly hinted at the possibility of expanding the Apple Watch with hardware accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suxWRo"&gt;The most famous of these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8676901/apple-watch-secret-port-charges-faster"&gt;was the Reserve Strap&lt;/a&gt;, which attempted to use the port for extending the battery life of the Apple Watch by incorporating extra batteries into a specially made band that would slot directly into the diagnostic port. The port actually offered &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; charging than Apple’s own magnetic cable, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmIBnjNnV8fTl2XKhGyRler4aJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924623/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_3.58.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reserve Strap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xk1iH"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11460712/apple-watch-wristband-reserve-strap-accessory-loophole"&gt;Apple quickly blocked that capability&lt;/a&gt; and Reserve Strap (along with virtually every other attempt at harnessing the port for useful purposes). For the subsequent life span of the Apple Watch, it remained useful for its intended purpose: diagnostics for internal Apple use and repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xP1EOD"&gt;Of course, Apple still needs a way to do diagnostics on the Apple Watch, and appears to be replacing the mysterious port with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mysterious 60.5GHz wireless module&lt;/a&gt; that pairs with a magnetic dock capable of local data transfer for internal use. That’s led to some speculation that Apple is using the Series 7 as a test bed for a future portless iPhone that could use similar technology to replace cables for connecting to a computer. But if years of the useless diagnostic port have taught us anything, it’s that sometimes there’s no greater meaning or utility to be found in proprietary diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDvDWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:17pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added MacRumors sourcing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Safari extensions on your iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxdtPME6LdsDlwMyFZFoxseD6U0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990647/akrales_210917_4760_0330.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OnAPJ1"&gt;One of the handiest types of software in anyone’s quiver is the browser extension: those cool little applets that let your browser do what you want it to do. And one of the nicest things about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is that you can now add extensions to the Safari browser. Even though this is a new feature that launched with the latest iOS version, there are already a number of useful extensions available for you to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasHh9"&gt;What follows is a rundown on how to add extensions to your Safari app — while we’ve illustrated the process using an iPhone, you can follow the same basic directions with an iPad. We’ve also included a sampling of some extensions you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WSYPV"&gt;How to add extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PeMPW1"&gt;Tap on the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Asir3B"&gt;Scroll down to and select Safari &amp;gt; Extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TITo5t"&gt;Any extensions that you’ve already installed will be listed here. Tap on “More Extensions” if you’d like to see what’s available in the App Store. (You can also simply go to the App Store and search on “Safari Extensions.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your settings, go to Safari &amp;amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AD67CZ0fV_CpSxi9R5SxShgnpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924238/makephotogallery.net_1634147611611.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your settings, go to Safari &amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="8nqVoA"&gt;Once you’ve installed your first extension, you’ll see a little “puzzle piece” icon on the left side of Safari’s address bar. Tap that, and the menu that pops up will include your current extensions plus a “Manage Extensions” selection, which lets you toggle your extensions on and off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtOUJLXJMIdbD7qzlHOPGsr-JmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924199/IMG_62BD37855789_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQeRleRBeQ_EwGaNC_62lTg0tr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924201/IMG_04F0290642C7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s7Bn4f"&gt;Some extensions to try&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDDk3"&gt;This is a small sampling of some of the extensions that you can now access via the App Store. While there are not many extensions yet available (compared to the number of extensions for, say, Chrome), it’s a pretty safe bet that there will be lots more to come over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EcWNOu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;Amplosion&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ac8e"&gt;AMP, which is short for “Accelerated Mobile Pages,” is a web format created by Google to optimize search results for mobile browsers. However, if you’d rather not have Google tweaking the webpages you upload, you can use Amplosion to redirect the AMP links that show up in search results into normal mobile links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdDvT0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noir-dark-mode-for-safari/id1581140954"&gt;Noir&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnD0m"&gt;When you’re browsing at night and you’ve set your iPhone or iPad to dark mode, you will often hit a website that is bright enough to make your eyes water. Noir allows you to set a dark mode for all the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2kHdjr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; (subscription needed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSUOV"&gt;1Password is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722617/1password-sharing-link-google-docs-secure"&gt;well-known and respected password manager&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a 1Password user, there’s no question that you’re going to want to add this one to your mobile Safari app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mL3I9c"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-agent-for-safari/id1568262835#?platform=iphone"&gt;Super Agent for Safari&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6RVAs2"&gt;This handy extension automatically fills out a website’s cookie consent forms based on your preferences, which can save you a lot of time and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="avc3ZM"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/web-inspector/id1584825745"&gt;Web Inspector&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJnWA2"&gt;Something for developers: an app that lets you inspect the HTML coding of a website, modify it, debug it, and perform other essential tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 review: time and time again</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A bigger screen and faster charging are nice, but not reasons to upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r78a4Q"&gt;The most important questions to ask about the new Apple Watch Series 7 aren’t about the Apple Watch Series 7, they’re about the Apple Watch you may already have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbnGfL"&gt;That’s a gentle way of saying that if there’s nothing wrong with your current watch, there’s nothing in the Series 7 that should compel you to upgrade. If you’ve been waiting for some key feature before buying your first Apple Watch, I don’t know that it’s here, either. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;wrote very nearly the same thing last year about the Series 6&lt;/a&gt; and I think that’s just what we should expect from the Apple Watch series going forward: iterative updates that will be great when you replace your current watch, but not a reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxqaof"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; great. The larger screen and faster charging are the two headline features and both are welcome. The Apple Watch is in a class entirely of its own right now. Nothing else is as good for iPhone users and nothing like it is available for Android users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rr2QCi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10803240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFtnb290teD_pSpxCtzldF4z6RE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908902/vpavic_211006_4796_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is 20 percent larger on the Apple Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PE3CaZ"&gt;Apple Watch design and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3WRkBW"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 didn’t get the major redesign that had been rumored. Instead, it looks almost identical to previous Apple Watches and maintains compatibility with all previous Apple Watch straps, although there are incredibly subtle changes in its overall size and curves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5lOXW"&gt;There are new color options available, including midnight (which apparently has a hint of blue in it), starlight (a cross between silver and gold), and a dark green. Apple sent me the green one and in most light it just looks gray — but every now and then it’ll pop and look visibly green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="zrbgNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bigger screen isn’t a reason to upgrade on its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The front glass is thicker and more crack resistant, with a “refractive” edge and smaller bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JFRGJH"&gt;The biggest change is the screen; it’s 20 percent larger than the last few iterations of the Apple Watch. It does the thing all screen upgrades tend to do: make the older screen with its larger bezels look small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8gyzF"&gt;When Apple first made the screen bigger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17875882/new-apple-watch-series-4-review-ekg-bands-screen-price"&gt;way back on the Apple Watch Series 4&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it made an appreciable difference in the experience and would even be worth upgrading for. Here, on the Series 7, I just think the screen is really nice and looks better, but isn’t enough to justify an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxje9k"&gt;Apple has kept the always-on screen and says that it is brighter in ambient mode when indoors. That is: the overall max brightness hasn’t changed, but when you’re inside, the screen should look a little less dim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHWO4"&gt;The other design change on the Series 7 is that it’s more durable. The front crystal on all models is thicker and stronger against cracking. (It’s also more refractive, so you can catch a glimpse of some pixels at extreme angles.) The whole watch adds IP6X dust resistance for the first time and maintains the same water resistance to 50 meters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxcE07"&gt;Apple didn’t add any new health sensors to the Series 7. It still tracks heart rate and has a blood oxygen monitor and EKG. None of these sensors should be used for diagnostic purposes as the Apple Watch is not a medical device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9NguEoxluYKwrSjCZzXL_9ZraI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908901/vpavic_211006_4796_0032_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 charges faster but has the same overall battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jUuETH"&gt;Apple Watch charging and battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6hmjtu"&gt;Apple is still targeting 18 hours of battery life on the Apple Watch Series 7. It’s enough to get through a day — maybe two if you turn off the always-on screen and don’t work out. In my tests, those numbers are borne out. I need to charge the Series 7 only a little less often than I need to charge my old Series 5 (which is starting to lose its battery capacity a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlwDN6"&gt;I wish Apple had done more to improve battery life on the Series 7, especially since this is technically a redesign. I would have even taken the same size screen as last year’s model if it had meant getting longer battery life instead. There’s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the Apple Watch’s battery life, but I do wish that it aimed higher like the new iPhones did this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7WklxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Faster charging is nice, but I was hoping for more battery life&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2KC2rF"&gt;Instead, we got faster charging thanks to a redesigned charging puck that also uses USB-C. Lots of people have those wall adapters but may need to pick up a second one (or a multi-charger), since it’s not included in the box. (As an aside, the actual plug part of the Apple Watch charger is longer now, which Apple says is to manage heat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8HzHt"&gt;The charging is faster. Apple claims it’s 33 percent faster than the older cable and that sounds right to me. I have been able to juice up 20 percent in just ten minutes several times and it has been easier to top off to a full charge in the morning while I putter around with coffee and breakfast. It makes it slightly more convenient to use the watch for sleep tracking since it’s easier to fit a quick charging session in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR96Ld"&gt;Still and all, I would have preferred standard Qi charging to faster charging (if I had to choose). Qi charging mats are cheap and plentiful now, but integrating an Apple Watch charger adds cost and complexity. Older Apple Watch chargers will work just fine with the Series 7, but at the slightly slower charging speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMVHZYvkBKwH28N7OxsRRj5YsDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908905/vpavic_211006_4796_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a few Series 7 exclusive features in WatchOS 8, including a keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHHCCf"&gt;WatchOS 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CV85Vt"&gt;There are a few features in WatchOS 8 that are exclusive to the Series 7, ostensibly because its larger screen makes them possible. The watch can fit just a little more text when reading a message, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Umfs96"&gt;The two watchfaces custom to the Series 7 are called “Contour” and “Modular Duo.” The former just puts numbers out on the edges of the screen and would apparently look bad on screens with larger bezels, while the latter allows you to have two full-width complications stacked instead of just one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uxTv"&gt;The larger screen also allows for a new text-entry option: a miniature keyboard. You can tap or swipe on it and as long as autocorrect is doing its thing correctly, it works fine. It’s about as good as any smartwatch keyboard I’ve used, but I still prefer dictating messages via Siri whenever possible. I wish I could compare it to the FlickType app that was kicked out of the App Store in January 2019, but it’s not back (and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22676706/apple-watch-swipe-keyboard-flicktype-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;lawsuit pending&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="VfJzvf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can finally set multiple timers in WatchOS 8 (but not on iOS 15)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0FGiHFxbhMUUAiOXnPFVa00vJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908909/vpavic_211006_4796_0084.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Modular Duo face lets the Series 7 (right) have two full-width complications. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Contour watch face is exclusive to the Series 7." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1izd5PwAiJ8EuI3ro7gZ9xU2PK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908910/vpavic_211006_4796_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Contour watchface is exclusive to the Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3Nlnp"&gt;Those are the Series 7-specific features, but WatchOS 8 has a few more things worth covering. It’s able to auto-detect outdoor bike workouts — and in my testing it managed to do that very well, even when I was hitting stoplights at every block. I wish Apple would make it easier to integrate the Watch’s workout data with cadence or power sensors on a bike, but cyclists are still on their own to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au4ZXk"&gt;Apple says it’s also adjusting your calorie metrics if the watch believes you’re riding an e-bike. There’s no setting for it, it just detects if your heart rate is suspiciously low and your speed is remarkably high as you cruise up a hill. There’s also no indicator in your results if your calorie metrics were adjusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAau3a"&gt;WatchOS 8 has a redesigned photos app and lets you send photos directly from the watch. It has an updated “Mindfulness” app with a “Reflect” feature that gives you some kind of prompt to meditate on, like “Recall a challenge you’ve overcome” and “Think about what sparks your creative energy.” As you can probably tell from the unnecessary scare quotes in the previous sentence, I don’t like it. I think meditation is a deeply personal — and for many people spiritual or religious — thing, and so I recoil whenever I see tech companies reducing the practice down to anodyne apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7h6u"&gt;I’ve left the best for last: the Apple Watch lets you set multiple timers. You can set them in the timer app. You can set them with Siri. You can use Siri to name each timer. You can see all your timers stacked one after the other. It’s magical. It’s wonderful. It’s hilarious that it took until 2021 to make this happen and even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; hilarious that the iPhone itself &lt;em&gt;still can’t do it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXp6kk"&gt;Seriously, though, multiple timers on the Apple Watch is great, especially for cooking. It means I don’t need to stay within earshot of the smart speaker in my kitchen if I’ve got something in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 7 in green." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzI7QElmyePeOV3IGRw5j3oxyGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908899/vpavic_211006_4796_0029.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 in green.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iyi6xQ"&gt;I have said this every year for several years now because it’s true every year: the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch for iPhone users, by far. There are fitness trackers that fulfill niches not filled by the Apple Watch like Garmins for more serious athletes or Fitbits for people who want something simpler. But as a general computer-on-your-wrist, the Apple Watch Series 7 is challenged only by older Apple Watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3zFWYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Still the best smartwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YghhQR"&gt;If you have one of those older Apple Watches, I don’t think there’s anything here that should compel an upgrade. All the new features are very nice but not necessary. If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something that’s bothering you about your current watch, then by all means go for it if you can afford it. Also, while the Series 3 is still kicking around for cheap, I don’t think it’s a great buy anymore. The Apple Watch SE is a better value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIc4JH"&gt;There’s no reason that we should have an expectation of major year-on-year updates for the Apple Watch. These smaller iterations might not be what we’ve been hoping for — a big redesign with much more battery — but that doesn’t make the Series 7 bad on its own merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vaBJsW"&gt;It’s a great watch — again, the best smartwatch. If it’s time for you to replace your watch (or buy your first one), you’ll love it. If it’s not time to replace your watch, it’s not time to replace your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="1A6fiL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10803297"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple exploring AirPods that take your temperature and monitor posture: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cOI7_9H7qLMFVkk_kc1jSClRIuk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988163/akrales_161216_1332_A_0259_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMjpHH"&gt;Apple is reportedly exploring new health-focused features for its AirPods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Features might include using the earbuds to take wearers’ temperature, monitor their posture, and improve their hearing. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that it’s not clear if the latter function differs significantly from AirPods’ existing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;Conversation Boost&lt;/a&gt;” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zGsMO"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, these functions “aren’t expected by next year and might never be rolled out to consumers or the timing could change.” In other words, it sounds like the iPhone maker is just exploring these new health features, rather than actively working on integrating them with products due out in the next year or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJnoTc"&gt;Adding these sensors would make sense for Apple. The company has increasingly marketed its products on the strength of their health and fitness applications, though so far, most of this attention has been focused on the Apple Watch. Reports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; suggested the company was looking into adding various sensors to the wearable, including monitoring blood pressure, temperature, sleep quality, blood oxygen, and blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srnaZf"&gt;Integrating health features into commercial products is tricky work, though, mostly because of the difficulty in meeting the high bar of medical regulatory standards. This inevitably leads to delays. It was &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in June, for example, that the next Apple Watch would add temperature monitoring, but this function never appeared in September’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF0o5J"&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t include much detail about Apple’s plans for the AirPods. Taking temperature from someone’s ear is commonplace, though, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40438857/i-tried-five-high-tech-solutions-that-promised-to-fix-my-terrible-posture-did-they-work"&gt;many posture devices&lt;/a&gt; on the market that use digital sensors to alert wearers when they’re slouching. Apple has already shown it’s interested in using AirPods as a hearing assistant of some sort, though the earbuds are not actually approved for this purpose by the FDA. &lt;/p&gt;
