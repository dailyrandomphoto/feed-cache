    <title>The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s a computer?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ghkmHd"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;a lot of iPad keyboard cases&lt;/a&gt; out there that aim to turn Apple’s tablet into a laptop, but the Kensington StudioDock is something altogether different: it turns your iPad Pro into the world’s tiniest iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAAebO"&gt;This is a serious accessory for people who are serious about iPad productivity. (Yes, they exist.) It’s a dock that lets you use your USB-C-equipped iPad Pro or Air in portrait or landscape orientation while giving it a whole lot more connectivity. Basically, if you ever sit down and work at your desk with an iPad Pro, the StudioDock could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHOLt9"&gt;Well, if you’re happy to spend $399, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHI3wd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10394868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eECvZe"&gt;The StudioDock is mostly made from aluminum and is sturdy enough that you can adjust the iPad’s position without it moving on your desk, making it easy to switch between portrait and landscape modes or tilt the vertical viewing angle. (An iPad Pro in a StudioDock in portrait mode is a great Zoom device, for example.) The build quality of the stand itself is solid, though the plastic back panel does feel a little low rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A7BDm"&gt;On one side of the dock you’ll find a USB-C port and a power button, while the other has an SD card slot and a headphone jack. Around back there’s a barrel connector for power, three USB-A ports, an HDMI port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. There are also two 7.5W Qi wireless chargers integrated into the stand’s base, and (of course) two Kensington security locks. The iPad Pro connects over USB-C and slots onto a magnetic plastic panel that helps support the jack; the dock is available for 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads, though the size of the magnetic panel is the only thing that’s different between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l90EFQ"&gt;Once your iPad is connected with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse hooked up, it’s like having a little desktop computer with a touchscreen — and way more ports than most Mac laptops these days. It’s really quite adorable, if you find things like the idea of wired internet connectivity on a tablet adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87CwfWp9cCdOiHKqtXsAOJ8YXpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374202/DSCF7585.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IE7OZS"&gt;Even if you aren’t using a bunch of accessories, the StudioDock is more comfortable to use at a desk than a laptop simply because it raises the display to a better angle. I’m reminded of a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcover-story%2Fcover-story-2020-12-07&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22333551%2Fkensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; cover&lt;/a&gt; showing a woman at home with her laptop precariously perched on a pile of books. Laptop stands exist, obviously, but not everyone wants to use them, and I like that the StudioDock means you’re not stuck with a redundant keyboard and trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8BXIQ"&gt;A crucial element of this product is that it’s easy enough to move the iPad to and from the dock. It’s still slightly fiddly and in a perfect world I’d want the StudioDock to use the Smart Connector, but since no-one other than Apple and Logitech has ever released products that actually do use it, I assume Kensington had its reasons — bandwidth no doubt among them. One benefit of this design is that it charges the iPad very quickly at 37.5W, so I haven’t had to think about charging it any other way at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r4I7l"&gt;Kensington also sent an Apple Watch charger that attaches to the USB-C passthrough port. It’ll be sold separately after the StudioDock is released. I found it a little plasticky, like the dock’s back panel, but it worked fine. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;already make use of an Apple Watch desktop charger&lt;/a&gt; every day so I didn’t see much need for this, but if you don’t yet have one then this would be a convenient add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFBgmNRbM6vffKbJp5K7g7YuuRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374205/DSCF7586.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NmSN6a"&gt;The wireless chargers, meanwhile, are also a nice addition. You won’t get the fastest speeds out of them, but the ability to charge a phone and AirPods throughout the day is useful and saves space on your desk compared to separate pads. I did notice a slight coil whine noise when devices were fully charged — this isn’t all that uncommon with wireless chargers, but not all of them do it, so it’s worth noting that this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA7rle"&gt;The StudioDock’s HDMI port supports 4K monitors at 60Hz and should be ideal for iPad dual-display setups, but the software isn’t really there yet on Apple’s part. Only a few apps let you show different content on each monitor — the rest of the time you’re dealing with a pillarboxed mirror of your iPad’s 4:3 screen. (One clever way to get around this is an app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shiftscreen/id1498683180"&gt;Shiftscreen&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a browser that lets you run up to four web apps across two displays — useful for things like multitasking in Slack and Asana.) I’d personally need iPadOS to get much better external monitor support before I went all-in on an iPad desktop setup, but if you’re used to using a laptop by itself, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be big enough for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSp4Yn"&gt;That’s how I used the StudioDock most of the time, and it was generally a great experience. I really like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;trackpad support&lt;/a&gt; that was added to iPadOS last year, and it’s great to be able to combine that with a wired mechanical keyboard and still have a ton of connectivity options. I will just say that I would generally rather use the StudioDock than a laptop balanced on a pile of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mnf80AHI0WGnv6HvUWzdjaaAKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374204/DSCF7588.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IxUsrk"&gt;The StudioDock is plainly a niche product, and it does have its quirks. But for the most part, Kensington’s attempt to morph the iPad into a desktop computer actually works. You’d have to be really into the iPad-as-work-machine lifestyle for this to make sense for you, but the StudioDock and iPad Pro combination is a fast, fun computer that does most of what I want it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMfxK"&gt;My biggest hangup is the price. It &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodock%E2%84%A2-ipad-docking-station?utm_source=ktg&amp;amp;utm_medium=landing_page_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ktg_to_store"&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $399.99 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro version, or $379.99 for a model that fits the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. That’s clearly a lot of money to invest into a third-party peripheral — it’s more than some iPads cost alone. And I’d worry about whether it’d work with any future iPad Pro designs, considering the current Pros haven’t had a significant update since their introduction in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QBqSRH"&gt;Those are some pretty big caveats, but if you can get over them, the StudioDock is a great way to work on an iPad. It turns the tablet into a more comfortable, capable, and flexible computer, and I just hope Apple’s software evolves to make this kind of use case even better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues the HomePod, but the HomePod mini will live on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="top of the homepod" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/174-vKAIGR1bUhYwRdDez8RQFhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68959072/jbareham_180202_2266_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dRK1FF"&gt;Apple is discontinuing the original, full-size HomePod and will now focus its speaker efforts on the HomePod mini, the company told &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/?tpcc=ECTW2020&amp;amp;guccounter=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; on Friday evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ETn8m"&gt;Here is what Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OSuvgh"&gt;HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hB7LYG"&gt;The Space Grey model of the full-size HomePod is already sold out on Apple’s online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTNVVt"&gt;The full-size HomePod had great sound quality, but it was criticized for its high $349 price tag &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually dropped the price to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295084/apple-homepod-price-cut-299-smart-speaker"&gt;$299 in April 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and came out with the $99 HomePod mini last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmf5RK"&gt;The move isn’t altogether surprising; sales of the HomePod have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366778/apple-homepod-sales-estimate-600-thousand-units-smart-speaker"&gt;reportedly been low&lt;/a&gt;, and in our review, we felt that the HomePod mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;offered good sound&lt;/a&gt; for its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpyaZy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s MagicMobile pass is a contactless alternative to the MagicBand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1VJ52mPW28fRWK4rlYXvVyv3wM=/48x0:576x352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68956214/mmo012394820394820394823fi_624x352.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who needs a plastic wristband when you can use your iPhone to do the same thing?&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC1KwZ"&gt;In 2013, Walt Disney World resort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3845622/disney-world-magicbands-mymagic-data-gathering"&gt;offered the MagicBands&lt;/a&gt; — a plastic bracelet that made it easy to perform numerous services such as park tickets. And now, almost a decade later, the company is finally making your trip to the most magical place on Earth a little more modern with &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;MagicMobile&lt;/a&gt;, a digital pass accessible through your iPhone and Apple Watch starting later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6nlTg"&gt;As an alternative to spending money on a plastic NFC wristband, the MagicMobile pass will be added to your Apple Wallet. Guests can then use their iPhone or Apple Watch to gain entry into the park. Disney has not said exactly when MagicMobile will officially be available but confirmed Apple devices would get access to the service and features first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwX3sz"&gt;Disney confirmed in &lt;a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/coming-soon-disney-magicmobile-service-a-convenient-new-way-to-experience-walt-disney-world-resort/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the MagicBands will still be an option, and guests can choose which option is more convenient for them or even use both and alternate between the MagicBand and MagicMobile pass. (Disney says it’s introducing new MagicBand colors and designs featuring Disney characters.) The company also notes that MagicMobile will not replace the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fplan%2Fmy-disney-experience%2F%3FCMP%3DILC-DPFY21Q2wo0311210317210005C&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F12%2F22327351%2Fdisney-magicmobile-pass-announced-iphone-apple-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My Disney Experience app&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a digital room key for guests staying at a Disney Resort hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA86QY2DKSwH07ZT7beT5FHyO3Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950940/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8u8rBK"&gt;Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent. Lancaster apparently did this in hopes of gaining publicity for his next venture after leaving Apple. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported on the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nWQN"&gt;“Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,” commented Apple in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We take very seriously this individual’s deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain. We will do all we can to protect the innovations we hold so dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXqLk"&gt;According to Apple’s suit, Lancaster and his correspondent began communicating in 2018 about the possibility of obtaining information; the two then spent the next year in communication. Lancaster then reportedly contacted his correspondent in spring 2019, asking him to investigate rumors of a potential Apple product that could “mean trouble for my startup.” The lawsuit also claims that Lancaster boasted to a third party shortly after that conversation that his media contact would be writing a story on his startup if it hit $1 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpnIE4"&gt;In October 2019, Lancaster reportedly notified his correspondent that he was planning to leave Apple, giving over secret information on Apple products and asking if they wanted “to write a story about a 12-year Apple Design Veteran leaving for an amazing startup?” The correspondent also allegedly asked Lancaster to get additional information on an unannounced project that Apple refers to as “Project X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0Uz1"&gt;Lancaster then submitted his notice of resignation to Apple on October 15th, but kept chatting with his media source — the next day, they allegedly asked for specific documents they wanted Lancaster to get before he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRJhH"&gt;Apple also alleges that Lancaster specifically attended a meeting about “Project X” even after he had submitted his resignation notice, specifically to get more information to pass along to his media contact, despite the fact that he had been instructed by other employees not to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZRmH"&gt;The company also claims that Lancaster used his Apple credentials to download confidential information almost up until his employment ended at midnight on November 1st, 2019. According to Apple, Lancaster logged in from an external location at 10:24PM that day — this time, to get materials that the company says would help his new employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARMU4S"&gt;Lancaster &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started working at Apple in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and spent 11 years working at the company, serving as advanced materials lead and product design architect in his final role there &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;before leaving in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to join Arris Composites, a material design company, as its head of consumer products. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005108/en/Simon-Lancaster-Former-Advanced-Materials-Lead-at-Apple-Joins-Arris-Composites-to-Unlock-Future-of-Consumer-Products"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing his switch to Arris, Lancaster worked on the 13-inch and 15-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar redesigns, along with “unreleased Apple products.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to its lowest price yet at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gp87MpEN52NqscYEa18exklB5S8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948540/dbohn_201109_4283_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XmzMm7"&gt;At $129, Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is an expensive accessory. But if you are looking to buy this charger at a more reasonable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734624700779477900#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has knocked $29 off the MagSafe Duo&lt;/a&gt; today, bringing the price down to $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLZ0eF"&gt;The MagSafe duo is a 2-in-1 charger that allows you to wirelessly charge select iPhones, Apple Watches, certain AirPods wireless charging cases, and other Qi-certified devices. If you plan to buy this charger, keep in mind that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;does not include a USB-C charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, which you will need to buy separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DM0Q7t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you’re an Apple Watch owner who has either a 40mm or 44mm model and you are looking to buy a new loop for your wearable, you’re in luck. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for only $18 with code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPL &lt;/strong&gt;applied at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;We think this is a good deal for a few reasons, most notably because these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally retail for $49 on Apple’s direct website. Additionally, a few colors are not available on Apple’s website that Daily Steals has available, such as a Pride-themed Sport Loop. These Sport Loops also include a one-year warranty through Apple. It’s worth noting, though, that there are more options for the 44mm-sized Apple Watch models than 40mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCHb2t"&gt;This promotional code only applies to one strap in your cart, so if you buy more than one, the code will only adjust the price for one unit. However, we had luck getting this deal twice with two separate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bpArmf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qzizg3"&gt;Best Buy knocked down the price of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734506907090543434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a refurbished pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; to $80. If you are apprehensive about buying refurbished products, Woot is currently selling a brand-new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://sellout.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-wireless-earbuds-13?ref=w_gw_dd_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds in black for only $105&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeIuf9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly denies Parler’s App Store appeal, citing derogatory terms and ‘Nazi symbols’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP8YutyzG6d7B9X6LQEDp11Oglw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944888/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9cLIw"&gt;Apple has reportedly denied social media company Parler’s bid to reenter the iOS App Store, saying its platform hasn’t addressed problems with offensive content. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported the news earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a message reportedly sent on February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVsGFX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple said that Parler’s &lt;a href="https://legal.parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf"&gt;latest community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still didn’t meet its standards. “Simple searches reveal highly objectionable content, including easily identified offensive uses of derogatory terms regarding race, religion and sexual orientation, as well as Nazi symbols,” it reportedly told Parler. “For these reasons your app cannot be returned to the App Store for distribution until it complies with the guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eUzW2M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parler expects and hopes to keep working with Apple”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwnqMt"&gt;Parler’s guidelines ban threats, spam, and some other categories of content. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;right-wing-friendly network’s&lt;/a&gt; policies remain permissive compared to other social platforms, and its stated goal is that “removing users or user-provided content be kept to the absolute minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6lPLq"&gt;That strategy has put it at odds with several major companies. Apple and Google both banned its app from their mobile stores in January, following the January 6th mob attack on the US Capitol. And Amazon took the site offline by suspending its web hosting agreement, saying representatives had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;raised concerns about violent threats&lt;/a&gt; preceding the attack. Parler responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;filing suit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, although it has since relaunched on a different hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnaONX"&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Parler said the network had added significant new filtering mechanisms since the initial ban. “We have since engaged Apple to show them how we’ve incorporated a combination of algorithmic filters and human review to detect and remove content that threatens or incites violence,” said Parler Chief Policy Office Amy Peikoff. “Parler expects and hopes to keep working with Apple to return to the App Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gMbx3"&gt;Peikoff also touted new filtering options that enable users to block racist and gendered attacks out of their feeds. However, the filters are optional, and are consistent with Apple’s claim that derogatory terms and hate symbols remain present on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aW47qi"&gt;While Peikoff maintains that Parler hopes to return to iOS, the company is already taking steps to divest from the platform. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also reports that Parler cut ties with its last three iOS app developers alongside four other employees. The company still maintains an Android app that can be side-loaded from outside Google’s Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;its site relaunched&lt;/a&gt; on February 15th. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KJzwW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9:10 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Added statement from Parler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="adobe signature" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjbjjFADHTq31dc0jvrpDmyryDw=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941923/Adobe-Reader-EchoSign-iPad-Ink_Signature_Tool.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="biDYjK"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldxgQF"&gt;If you’re using a Mac, the process is refreshingly easy — just use the built-in Preview app to create and save your digital signature.  (If you’re using a Windows PC, unfortunately, it’s not quite as simple.) After that, when you open a PDF using Preview, it will be a simple matter of dropping the signature into the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuj5t1"&gt;To create your signature, you first have to have a PDF ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqdcaZ"&gt;Open a PDF document using your Mac’s built-in Preview app. (If you don’t have a PDF document handy, you can create one with your favorite word processor and save it as a PDF file.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTP7Vf"&gt;Open the Markup tool, either by clicking on the “pen in a circle” symbol on the top right of the Preview window or by selecting View &amp;gt; Show Markup Toolbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9tESYh"&gt;Click on the Signature icon (it’s the one that looks like a signature on a line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUzOkY0V_xOxGmA2jcph5CZPuPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357983/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_3.00.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the Signature icon to create your signature via trackpad, camera, or phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOqMsK"&gt;Now, you can create your signature. As you can see from the three buttons on top of the window, you have a choice of three methods: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YZoTUM"&gt;Select Trackpad. Click on the “Click Here to Begin” button in the center of the screen, sign your name on the trackpad, hit any key, and then click on “Done.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tF4TPe"&gt;Write your name on a piece of white paper, select Camera, and hold the paper up to the camera (and on the line that appears across the screen) until you see the signature appear on the screen. (Two notes: first, the signature will appear reversed as you hold it up, but the digitized version will be correct. Also, if there are any other markings on the paper or if the paper doesn’t fill the screen, you are likely to get other markings recorded besides the signature, so you may need to try it a couple of times to get it right.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw8S_766-dKovKfLDHMnZFnJVsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357988/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.26.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you hold your written signature up to the camera, it will appear reversed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DH8G9WgqNgZSplZCnVpDfYeaBYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357992/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.29.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HedzDU"&gt;Select iPhone. If you have an iPhone associated with the Mac, your phone will almost immediately pop up a field on which you can write your signature; your signature will be mirrored on your Mac.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When the signature is captured, it will no longer be a mirror-image" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7c_r1m6Yo-O7GwkqYvJqIRUBFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358000/mysig.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screenshot shows what the signature field looks like on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X2ZS9zUPN0qTZ-lpYuolp4Kh0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358019/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.34.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As you write, the signature will simultaneously appear on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AgSFFf"&gt;With any of these methods, if you need to try again, just hit the “Clear” button on the lower left of the window to get rid of the unwanted signature. Once you’re happy with it, click on “Done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWPnNK"&gt;Now, whenever you want to add your signature to a document in Preview, just click on the Signature icon and click on your signature. It will appear in a box on your document which you can then use to adjust the size and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1t60BhdsgBtpswS5moYEm85nzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358020/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.42.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature will now appear under the Signature icon in the Preview app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMQ-3CcSxEIGPJYSAPS4PQPuK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358021/Screen_Shot_2021_03_09_at_4.46.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the signature to where you want it and make it larger or smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="53mHeR"&gt;And if you want a second signature, just create it in the same way. After that, when you click the Signature icon, you’ll see both signatures and can select the one you want to use. Don’t need one of the signatures anymore? Hover over the signature until you see a small “x” next to it, and click on that to delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $21 on select Nintendo Switch games for Mario Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Mario Odyssey" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x50RGKR90fsJSF3z8stwJIAgJt4=/96x0:1161x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941706/mario.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVmATT"&gt;Today is “MAR10 Day,” and although it is not Mario’s “birthday” (which is September 13th), this day usually has some of the best deals on games published by Nintendo. Nintendo rarely discounts its first-party games, so if you recently purchased a Switch and want to stock up on some games, today is a good day to expand your game library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPa1fQ"&gt;Several retailers — including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mario+bros+Switch+games&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734509568504630408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fcollection%2Fmario-bros" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnintendo-switch-games%2F2636_4646529_4234943&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; — are slashing the prices of some Nintendo games, with up to $21 in savings available.

    <title>Apple reportedly overestimated iPhone 12 mini demand, by a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PX2wXenA5__HmquoXnkOMHZwero=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940493/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwFmuf"&gt;Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 12 mini in the first half of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-slashes-planned-iPhone-12-mini-production-for-1H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Planned production of the smallest iPhone 12 model has reportedly been reduced by 70 percent or more in the first half of this year, making up the majority of a 20 percent cut in total iPhone 12 production. Some suppliers have been asked to temporarily stop producing iPhone 12 mini-specific components, while other parts are being reallocated to the Pro and Pro Max, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCFt4B"&gt;Alongside the iPhone production news, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has pushed back production for two new Apple Silicon MacBooks. Originally due to enter mass production in May or June, the laptops will now be manufactured in the second half of the year. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t reveal which of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; these could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93q6qX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone production is still expected to be up overall compared to 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOTPMS"&gt;Despite the cuts, iPhone production is still scheduled to be up overall compared to 2020. Apple reportedly plans to produce 75 million handsets in the first half of the year, and 230 million phones over the course of 2021. Part of the reason is though to be because Apple was overly aggressive in booking up production capacity in the first place ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage is now creating problems for companies both inside and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqyNCZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report is the latest indication that Apple’s miniature addition to its flagship smartphone lineup hasn’t lived up to expectations. Last month&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUKKBN2A91N0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on analyst data which claimed sales of the 12 mini had made up just five percent of Apple’s smartphone sales in the first half of January. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that as of the end of last year, the mini made up 10 to 15 percent of Apple’s iPhone 12 series orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7HjEh"&gt;Although we liked the iPhone 12 mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;when we reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, overall smartphone demand is trending towards phones with bigger screens. And while the 12 mini also benefits from being cheaper than the other handsets in the iPhone 12 lineup, customers have the option of &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-disappointed/#h-iphone-12-mini-sales:~:text=The%20CIRP%20report%20also%20touches%20on,be%20more%20enticing%20for%20certain%20buyers%3A"&gt;buying previous year’s models&lt;/a&gt; if they want to save money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to block ad tracking on your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7i381_390v3EmPJR4vG1EUJHbKc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68932275/akrales_180620_1777_0259.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jwd5Mq"&gt;In 2019, an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/?utm_term=.f643c2a83a4c"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Geoffrey Fowler described the author’s shock when he discovered just how many of his iPhone apps were collecting and uploading information about his usage while he slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqUHGx"&gt;As we all know by now, data is a huge commodity these days. If you use a phone, laptop, or any type of computing device (unless you’re a security expert or a high-end hacker with access to sophisticated blocking tools), you’re paying for your apps by contributing marketing and other info to the companies that supply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdXttf"&gt;As Fowler’s article demonstrated, iPhone users are not immune to this. Since his article was published, Apple has made some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;laudable changes to its privacy policies&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s still a good idea to take charge of your own data. There are some simple ways to minimize the amount of tracking that app vendors can do and the amount of data they can access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="exJEUb"&gt;Turn off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WBCofK"&gt;According to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223"&gt;Advertising &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/a&gt; page: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="q8RHB4"&gt;Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQYsb"&gt;However, the page goes on to say that contextual data, such as info about your device, its location, your App Store searches, and what you read on Apple News could be collected. You can get around this somewhat by &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074"&gt;turning off personalized and location-based ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qhWD8Y"&gt;To turn off personalized ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WdWeaM"&gt;Select your “Settings” app, tap on “Privacy,” and scroll down to and select “Apple Advertising” (it will be near the bottom of the list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7xqUx9"&gt;Toggle “Personalized Ads” off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYufa7jODsVR4KBYI-5I5otB6oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354741/IMG_DBA61BE67C50_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can toggle off personalized ads from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also toggle off Location Services" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgXwGGyt03lg7-aKZwHOjlkcjEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354742/IMG_B32453FF7846_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also toggle off Location Services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFThlr"&gt;To turn off location-based ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="exNzsg"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services” (at the top of the display).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RGKWdi"&gt;Toggle off “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IuI4ot"&gt;On this page, you can also change several of your apps, such as the App Store or Maps, to allow location access never, ask next time, or while using the app. Also, note that you can still use the “Find My Phone” feature; it will temporarily enable Location Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGtgw9"&gt;If you want to see how effectively your phone is protected, you could try taking the &lt;a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/"&gt;Panopticlick test&lt;/a&gt;, which is offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It monitors device fingerprinting, among other things. I ran it on an Apple iPhone 11 after following the above instructions, and I got a “partial protection” result for blocking tracking ads, blocking invisible trackers, and protecting from fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wLgon"&gt;Lock down Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2syYGD"&gt;If you use the Safari browser on your iPhone, there are several things you can do to make it safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP9Skpg9JRA8To7I-bgYpfkkBp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354806/IMG_6A5B7FC23344_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your iPhone’s Settings, select “Safari.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure, but can also be inconvenient" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U0R5Ln16IilJQLWG23TK8Q4zXJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354812/IMG_06711E4C44E2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enabling “Block All Cookies” is more secure but can also be inconvenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9Lo0v1"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zdMkKN"&gt;Select “Safari,” and scroll down to the “Privacy &amp;amp; Security” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="or38q5"&gt;Turn on “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” (which means advertisers and other third-party content providers can’t track you from one site to another).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oX8nX2"&gt;Turn on “Block All Cookies.” The cookies collected by various websites can contain a great deal of information about how you use the site, what info you put into it, etc. By blocking cookies, you prevent that data from being collected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM4Zf"&gt;However, you will probably make things very inconvenient for yourself. Your visits to sites will not be recorded, so, for example, you may not be able to revisit a playlist or repurchase the same T-shirt you bought last year. Some sites will even refuse entry if you don’t allow them to collect cookies. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fv7b88"&gt;Turn off Background App Refresh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0XgVrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202070"&gt;According to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, the reason to have Background App Refresh turned on is to allow suspended apps (apps that aren’t currently active) to “check for updates and new content.” According to Disconnect, the privacy app company that Geoffrey Fowler cites in his article, it also allows apps to collect marketable tracking data and transmit that data even when you’re not using the app. Interestingly, iPhones ship with Background App Refresh turned on, but it’s not terribly hard to turn off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAlq90"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:6359379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2sishI"&gt;Go to “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EKg5tY"&gt;Select “General.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxM8Zy"&gt;Select “Background App Refresh.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UX9E4h"&gt;You’ll see a list of all the apps that use this feature, and they’re all going to be turned on. Find “Background App Refresh” at the top of the page, and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ITsFC2"&gt;You’ll be brought to a page that lets you enable it for Wi-Fi and cellular data, for Wi-Fi only, or you can turn it off altogether. Select “Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XNsYpK"&gt;If you go back to the previous page, you’ll see that all of the toggles for the various apps are completely gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ahdHe2"&gt;You may want to be selective about which apps can work in the background. Some apps might not work well otherwise. For example, Google Photos won’t automatically back up your camera roll unless this feature is enabled. So you can, if you wish, leave “Background App Refresh” on, and then choose which specific apps you want to toggle off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YLMFr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 8th, 2021, 5:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on May 30th, 2018; several portions have been updated to reflect changes in iOS. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
