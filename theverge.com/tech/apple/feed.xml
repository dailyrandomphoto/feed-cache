    <title>Amazon’s Blink outdoor cameras with floodlight and solar-charging configurations are $50 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blink Floodlight Cam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QuaJYDnSagCLW_DNH5d5uo9ePy4=/40x0:1155x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70426284/Blink_Flood_Light_Cam_1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mZNMmI"&gt;Mondays are for football hangovers, extra strong coffee, and deals. If the weekend brought you grief due to some big playoff upsets, we’re here to ease the pain with great savings on gadgets. What better way to dull the sting of an abysmal 13-10 loss to the sixth seed when you’re supposed to be the favorite to win it all? Put down the cheese and dry those tears with some excellent deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="512vpf"&gt;First up, the latest Blink Outdoor cam with a floodlight attachment is currently just $89.98 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Floodlight-Camera/dp/B094YXVVRF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgub0TC81Bm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50 less than its regular price of $139.98. It comes equipped with a 700-lumen LED floodlight and the Sync Module 2 for connectivity. If you want to make battery anxiety a thing of the past, the Blink Outdoor camera with a solar charger mount is just $79.98 (also $50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Solar-Panel-Charging/dp/B099HXDWZS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cguca3anb1U" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the same camera in a configuration that pretty much ensures you may never swap batteries (though you have to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy your Sync Module separately for about $35&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff1CLA"&gt;If you’ve considered outdoor smart home cameras, you probably encountered the conundrum of going wireless and dealing with limited battery life or going wired and dealing with installation. These cameras from Blink offer a convenient compromise, with battery life that lasts up to two years on just two 1.5-volt AA lithium batteries. They may not offer some of the extra features like person detection or package detection, but they nail the essentials with motion detection and 1080p video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DxE2cw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why does Blink still exist?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22704290/amazon-blink-ring-camera-doorbell-brands-smart-home-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="nDvb7o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10993169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UJHwqo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10993173"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pC2h0U"&gt;The most basic Apple AirPods are still a fine choice in 2022, especially when they drop down to a price as affordable as one Benjamin. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the second-gen AirPods with a wired charging case for $99.99&lt;/a&gt; — saving you about $29 off the usual going rate. The only time that price gets any better is around Black Friday or maybe Prime Day. These AirPods from 2019 have been leap-frogged in performance by the excellent AirPods Pro (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which are currently discounted to $179.99&lt;/a&gt;) and usurped by the newer third-gen model, but they’re still readily available and a worthwhile pickup if you have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac and value the convenience of their excellent connectivity and audible Siri notifications. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dw1Sda"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LD2zi"&gt;Speaking of Apple’s products that perform well for their price and size, the popular &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/homepod-mini.product.100696292.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomePod Mini is just $79.99&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off) at Costco in either white or space gray. This deal is exclusive for Costco members with a limit of three per member and costs another $2.99 for shipping. The HomePod Mini is the diminutive smart speaker from Apple that supports Siri voice commands, easy HomeKit integration for smart home connectivity, and solid audio quality from a small speaker — complete with multi-speaker pairing. It’s the only smart speaker currently on offer from Apple since its larger sibling was discontinued in 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lJE19a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10883175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHnYFX"&gt;If you’re getting started a little early on securing a new TV before the Super Bowl, the deals are slowly beginning to trickle in. The 48-inch LG C1 OLED, one of our favorite picks around for watching movies or sports and playing games, is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED48C1PUB%2FLG-OLED48C1PUB-48-Inch-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-2021-Model&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898743%2Famazon-blink-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-apple-airpods-homepod-mini-lg-c1-google-nest-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,096.99 at BuyDig and comes with an extended four-year accidental damage warranty and $50 Visa gift card&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy it from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324842746233%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAoGTUIR8%252BZ4lujSDlpkPX60tQCoc7kdJ94wOGR9%252Bznn%252B9dKyrdNEuQqNFju%252F%252BFnF81jFyvxTUwGR48Iwn4BhpJ6HpAB1OwwrmEybri0Jo6h21Net8c%252Fu6%252FK28iIbLnH2Y%252BDmhOPJuWNb481GQIyXniGwv0UBxeTRARu2SVhB7EBZFUFpCoc5pr2hcP2SPn5waqUQztsDqbNA5nSjpVLj0rmw%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBM6Lna0dFf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDealsRoundup012422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898743%2Famazon-blink-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-apple-airpods-homepod-mini-lg-c1-google-nest-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s eBay store, that $50 gift card is replaced by a $100 eBay credit&lt;/a&gt; to be used later.

&lt;p id="3b32g9"&gt;We’ve seen a plethora of deals on the Google Nest Hub Max come and go, but today’s hits a new all-time low that even bests Black Friday by an additional $10. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgubPXrLWZA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FGONESHUBCHLK&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F24%2F22898743%2Famazon-blink-outdoor-camera-floodlight-solar-apple-airpods-homepod-mini-lg-c1-google-nest-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig&lt;/a&gt; have the 10-inch camera-equipped smart display for about $170, a savings of $60. That is an exceptional value for the larger Nest Hub with bigger sound output that also works great for video calls. One of the killer features of Google’s displays is the integration with Google Photos, allowing the screensaver to be automatically populated by a shared album — and that experience is maximized with the big display of the Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends in-app purchase exemption for online group and event apps yet again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U44rZ18U7g6Ed8AyBm48Lyz0L4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70423063/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxW3Oj"&gt;Apple has extended its deadline requiring online group and event apps to comply with the company’s in-app purchase policy once again, as announced in a post on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=i71db0mv&amp;amp;1642879522"&gt;the company’s developer’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/22/apple-delays-app-store-rules/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Apps in this category can now use alternate payment options until June 30th, allowing them to skirt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple’s 15 to 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; the company takes out of in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTRWcL"&gt;“In 2020, we chose to support apps and developers that needed to adapt services from in-person to digital as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Apple writes in the post. “Given the recent resurgence of COVID and its continued impact on in-person services, we’ve extended the most recent deadline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z270vJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple first deferred its rule targeting group event apps in November 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0dJM"&gt;Apple introduced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=xqk627qu"&gt;changes to its in-app purchase policy&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020, clarifying apps that provide “one-to-few and one-to-many realtime experiences,” such as online classes and virtual group events, must process payments through in-app purchases. However, the company changed its rules to permit “person-to-person experiences” consisting of just two people, like medical consultations or real-estate tours, to use other payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eU45TI"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;facing criticism&lt;/a&gt; for charging event platforms a commission in the midst of a pandemic, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21595040/apple-developer-in-app-purchase-deadline-online-classes-events"&gt;decided to defer its rule targeting group event apps&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020 and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398338/apple-iap-classes-events-deadline-december-2021-2022"&gt;extended the reprieve until December 31st, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may soon let you transfer your chats from Android to iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_fa6K0moCEDnL4kdB3lx_d2158=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70421195/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LltKLa"&gt;WhatsApp might be working on a feature that lets you migrate your chat history from Android to iOS, as reported by &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-chat-history-migration-from-android-ios-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mtMaU"&gt;The feature was first spotted in the latest WhatsApp beta version 22.2.74 for iOS, and appears to corroborate &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-20-11-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; previous discovery in beta version 2.21.20.11 for Android&lt;/a&gt;. Both updates point towards a feature that may let you transfer your WhatsApp chats from Android to iOS using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios"&gt;Move to iOS app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRDR8NY6aSSsqg_8fQn91Qej9S4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23187939/wa_chat_history_android_to_ios.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WaBetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eZPKQH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; also shared a couple of screenshots that show what the feature may look like. Judging by the images, it appears WhatsApp will ask for permission before starting the transfer process, and will then instruct you to keep the app open and your phone unlocked as it migrates your chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKe9NE"&gt;WhatsApp first started letting users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;migrate their chat histories from iOS to Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; in September, and later extended the feature to support chat transfers from iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747446/whatsapp-chat-migrate-iphone-pixel-android-12"&gt;Google Pixels and other Android 12 devices&lt;/a&gt;. Letting users transfer their chats from Android to iOS would close an obvious loop, but it remains unclear which devices will support the rumored feature, as well as when (or if) it will start rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is $10 off for your first three months </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_9nqWHrIG9OH3EP7eutbM8rVLLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70420349/akrales_181010_2991_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New YouTube TV subscribers can pay YouTube TV $54.99 each month instead of $64.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0ADTn"&gt;Just in time for Super Bowl season, a three-month subscription to the YouTube TV streaming service is a little more affordable. Right now, new subscribers can &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;pay $54.99 each month instead of $64.99 for your first three months&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that would cost you around $195, so that means you’ll pay $165 by the end of this discount period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx08Ii"&gt;That’s still expensive, but it’s a welcome discount for a service that significantly gone up in price within the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109018/youtube-tv-price-change-signup-grandfathered-google"&gt;last few years&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, it’s a solid streaming app if you want many channels on-demand (with DVR capabilities available), presented in a familiar YouTube interface. For this price, you’ll get access to over 85 major channels, covering live sports, news, entertainment, and more. It also includes unlimited recording for up to six accounts, and you can cancel whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNS9ey"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="zz8Pdv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846634/youtube-tv-disney-streaming-channels-dispute-espn-fx"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22878110/super-bowl-lvi-2022-no-4k-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RDiInC"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on3ady"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max over-ear headphones sold for their lowest price ever during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In case you missed out on that deal, you have another chance at saving big today. For the first time since the holidays, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy the headphones in the sky blue colorway for $449 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 shy of their best price ever. That equates to a savings of $100 on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQQ7R"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s over-ear headphones offer excellent sound quality, while boasting great spatial audio features so you can better immerse yourself in a movie or  compatible music. The headphones are comfortable to wear for a long time as well thanks to their breathable knit mesh canopy. While $449 is still quite expensive, this could be a good deal for those deeply embedded within the Apple ecosystem given how seamlessly these headphones can also pair with other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XA9McH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvE4iK"&gt;When we first published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra one year ago, we called it the best Android phone on the market. We were impressed with the huge phone’s excellent camera system, as well as its stunning 6.8-inch dynamic OLED screen that boasts a high refresh rate. We appreciated its lengthy battery life, too, as well as how fast the  Snapdragon 888 processor-powered phone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Raudj"&gt;Though, almost a full year out from its release, we wouldn’t suggest paying $1,199.99 — its original price. However, if you can be swayed by a decent deal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the phantom black, 128GB model for $1049.99 today&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $150. That’s the lowest we’ve seen it sell for since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67VNhH"&gt;Note, Samsung will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Galaxy S22 series&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when, but that means we’ll likely see even more discounts on the Galaxy S21 lineup sooner rather than later. Still, if you can’t wait, this is a good deal for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoP20p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvmHwQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893756/samsung-galaxy-s22-2022-preorders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ab5Gu2"&gt;On the market for a budget-friendly tablet? Amazon is selling its 2020 Fire HD 8 tablets for half-off, with the ad-supported, 32GB base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $44.99 instead of $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you want slightly more RAM and wireless charging, the Fire HD 8 Plus is also 50 percent off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $54.99 instead of $109.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I7pLX"&gt;Regardless of which you buy, both offer a USB-C port for faster charging, and have a faster processor than their predecessors. While app selection is limited to Amazon’s Appstore, that still gives you access to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Zoom, Outlook, and more. If you’re leaning toward the Fire HD 8 Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in his review that you can use the Plus as an Echo Show if you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MP4PNYG/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase Amazon’s wireless charging dock alongside the tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so costs $108, down from $163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fLyTb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="t6bbI0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BXkoFx"&gt;Here are some even more deals to treat yourself to this weekend:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rUrVrp"&gt;Typically $59.99, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F265419191923%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkHzZbW8KkgQEADiqzkcqzSQgmhXsDBMhRufhkwVazKmaFBPeBDG82c%252FRmtwDbnCzhMqvq7yXrDR2PPTZy%252F9vFsysnuyNx5wGB%252FL4xiibIrnlaELM03nhesgW0oaZcTAlOogZvdMHW9b8n6EuttuaZIADxG3YYMFG5WBFm9zHztRfwoxxh3ksNJLLamCrfpuhiw%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMnv6xpNBf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s official eBay storefront is selling wired Xbox One gaming headsets for just $19.99.&lt;/a&gt;  While it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;the latest version&lt;/a&gt;, it should be suitable if you don’t want to spend too much on a headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BNVlyp"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which is compatible with 11-inch iPad Pros (2018 and up) and the fourth-gen iPad Air, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals1212022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-1st-2nd-or-3rd-Generation-and-iPad-Air-4th-Generation-iPad-Not-Included%2F984505060&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for $229 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $70 discount on the keyboard, which you can use to transform your tablet into something that’s more like a laptop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1UA0vo"&gt;The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is once again selling for $19.98 instead of $29.98&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the holidays, which is just $2 shy of its Black Friday price. This model supports &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Key-In-Garage-Delivery/"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, giving drivers the ability to securely drop packages off in your garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CZ6OXg"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pc150-2-pack-20w-usb-c-pd-wall-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy this two-pack of 20W USB-C chargers for $12.99 from Ravpower&lt;/a&gt; when you use the promo code &lt;strong&gt;RT50&lt;/strong&gt; (usually $27.99).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xiqt3Q"&gt;LaCie’s Rugged Mini 4TB external hard drive is on sale, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B01789QMUW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $129.99 instead of $159.&lt;/a&gt; If you need less storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B0058VIWTM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB model is $69.99 instead of $84.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $109.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 less than their typical asking price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668152-REG%2Fapple_mme73am_a_airpods_with_charging_case.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling them for $169&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target has them for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, just $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods.

That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still $59 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in blue at Amazon for $449&lt;/a&gt; — just $20 shy of their best price ever — and in most other colorways for $479. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;buy them in various colors at Micro Center for $449.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re happy to inform you that Apple isn’t requiring verification for education discounts anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIASYa"&gt;At &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;some point in the last month&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and backed up by reports from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-no-education-verification-requirement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/21/apple-education-store-verification-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays’ third-party verification service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y55hu8"&gt;It’s possible that the verification requirement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;spotted by Reddit users&lt;/a&gt;, will return. Apple already has verification processes in place in other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on whether the verification requirement’s removal was temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQhQZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;Customers have also noticed Apple placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. (These limits are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu"&gt;still listed on Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, despite verification being gone.) Given that it’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as a discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change (potentially temporarily) removed a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit — apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have a .edu email address — there was surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvMGC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 4:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the Unidays’ verification seems to have been removed from Apple’s US education store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s 32-inch, curved gaming monitor is on sale at Walmart for $160 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZl33K8GAco_RN48g11EMpFBqro=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416960/Optix_MAG321CQR_Press_Image.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The budget-friendly panel packs a 144Hz refresh rate and 1440p resolution.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGsaOQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 5:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woot has sold through its available stock of the Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWzAGC"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer, one of MSI’s best gaming monitors is now on sale at Walmart. The MSI Optix MAG321CQR normally retails $449.99 but is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Optix-31-5-16-9-QHD-RGB-LED-Non-Glare-Super-Narrow-Bezel-1ms-2560-x-1440-144Hz-Refresh-Rate-Free-Sync-Height-Adjustable-Curved-Gaming-Monitor-Bla%2F866580873%3Fathcpid%3D866580873%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DETq9k2xgFeUvULajDCcvVFd9f8WBYvi8ca8L%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $289.99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This 32-inch curved gaming panel comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to elevate your gaming setup. The Optix lands in a sweet spot by combining a 144Hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution, striking a solid balance between performance and visual fidelity. In addition to the expected HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, the monitor also features a pair of USB-A ports for power and a single port for data. The included stand is height and tilt adjustable, too, and the monitor is compatible with VESA mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xB7jB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="W4EE4l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI Creator Z16 review: thin isn’t everything","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22893308/msi-creator-z16-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LsNspc"&gt;While nabbing an Xbox Series S isn’t as difficult as getting your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days, Microsoft’s pearly white console is still in high demand. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup012122/https://www.woot.com/offers/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-3?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_13" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is hosting a deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its regular $299.99 price tag to $279.99. This isn’t a massive discount by any means but it matches the best price we’ve ever seen for this console. The Series S isn’t quite as powerful as the Series X with some of the key distinctions being a lack of a physical disc drive, less storage space, and a less powerful processor. However, the console is still home to fantastic first-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is compatible with a massive library of last-gen titles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/20/22892969/xbox-games-360-original-backward-compatible-digital-sale-deal-microsoft"&gt;many of which are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCriBu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is on sale right now for $79.99, a healthy $50 off the usual price tag. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, but it’s a decent value for anyone in the market for a TKL model. Just like other TKL keyboards, the Tournament Edition ditches the number pad and dedicated media playback buttons for a slimmer design that presents you with the essentials you need for gaming, in addition to the handy function row and navigation keys. It also uses Razer’s proprietary linear optical switches for smooth and rapid key presses, as well as a standardized keycap layout that allows you to swap out custom keycaps for a more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aeIloN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WwN5hz"&gt;Whether you need something to help keep your floors tidy or just a robotic chariot for your resident feline, the iRobot Roomba j7 is a solid option. Normally $649.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Wi-Fi-Connected-Vacuum/dp/B094NW318F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has recently discounted this model to $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smartest automated cleaning solutions for your home, the j7 can clean on a schedule or handle messes immediately with the help of the Roomba app or Alexa and Google voice assistants. This model also features integrated obstacle avoidance, which allows it to easily navigate furniture and other large objects, but also ensures that it won’t accidentally choke on an errant iPhone charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorc8r"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, however, the j7 features good battery life and is capable of avoiding poop and other pet messes it can’t handle effectively. One small caveat to this otherwise well-rounded robovac is that, unlike the more expensive iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, it lacks an auto-empty base, meaning you will need to empty the bin manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJogxi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="pMIFLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iRobot Roomba j7 Plus vs. JetBot AI Plus: can these robot vacuums pass the poop test?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="o6uTso"&gt;The Roccat Vulcan Pro keyboard represents one of the less conventional designs in the gaming keyboard space. Currently, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Vulcan-Optical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J4HQGZ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab this unique keyboard for $129.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a substantial drop from its usual price of $199.99 and the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard to date. The Vulcan Pro features a full-size layout with dedicated media playback buttons and a remarkably slim chassis. The slim style extends to the keycap design, which rests on top of the switches rather than around them, giving the keyboard the aesthetic of a sci-fi typewriter and providing a more prominent display for the RGB backlighting. One final feature that makes this keyboard unique is the software. The Roccat Neon software (formerly swarm) allows you to add custom typing sounds to your keyboard if you’re feeling nostalgic for that classic clicky sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hFqAze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989321"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Beats Fit Pro get their first major discount and drop to $153 (update: no longer available)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQEt-_8D2BkuiFz7ldNZ8js-RGg=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416262/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro come in black, gray, white, and pink. Today’s deal is on the black and white colorways.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vc0Erx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 1:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro deals at both Amazon and Walmart are no longer available at this time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAAegS"&gt;Time and time again, we see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"&gt;Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless earbuds getting frequent discounts and deals&lt;/a&gt;. In general, if you want to buy any pair of true wireless earbuds — with active noise cancellation or without — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;you should be able to find a deal somewhere&lt;/a&gt;. One holdout that has been elusive up to now was the Beats Fit Pro. These latest models from Apple-owned Beats came out in late 2021 and surprised us with how good they are — even besting the AirPods Pro in the sound quality department. They have held steady at their $199.99 price point the whole time, but now they finally see a discount of about $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hePsYN"&gt;Today, you can pick up the Beats Fit Pro on sale from Amazon and Walmart. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has both black and white colorways for $153.11&lt;/a&gt; (add it to your cart to see the price), while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Fit-Pro-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Beats-Black%2F232379973&amp;amp;subid1=beatsfitprobreakout012122" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has the black model matched at the same price&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has the white model on sale, but its discount is not as sizable. The funkier gray and purple colors remain at full price, but nothing beats black and white in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNqYcD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TESug6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;In our review of the Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Welch found the wing tips to be comfortable over long listening sessions — offering a more secure fit than the AirPods Pro. The sound quality is excellent, and the active noise cancellation and transparency mode are of the same caliber you expect from Apple and the AirPods Pro. The biggest caveats of these earbuds are their more limited functionality with Android phones and their lack of wireless charging. You have to plug the case in via USB-C, which is still nice to have in lieu of a Lightning port. At this discounted price, it’s easier to overlook these flaws, and if you use Apple products, you get all the conveniences of the H1 chip and deeper OS integration and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5a1d"&gt;Though Legendary’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made waves last summer by debuting on HBO Max and quickly becoming one of the platform’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/godzilla-vs-kong-opening-weekend-analysis-1234943958/"&gt;top performing features&lt;/a&gt;, the next time we see the titanic monster and his fellow kaiju, they’ll be calling new streamer home: Apple Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ucS26"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/apple-tv-lands-epic-godzilla-and-titans-original-television-series-based-on-legendarys-monsterverse/"&gt;Apple Plus announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has greenlit a new live-action series set in Legendary’s Monsterverse from co-creators Chris Black (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) and Matt Fraction, writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;run that the recent Disney Plus series heavily draws from. Along with Black and Fraction, Toho’s Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita and Safe House Pictures’ Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell are set to executive produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Legendary&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary’s Monsterverse logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l3eVgs"&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, the new untitled series is said to feature Godzilla, a number of the Titans, and yet another human family whose interpersonal dramas audiences are &lt;em&gt;meant &lt;/em&gt;to care about even though the literal monsters are what everyone’s really interested in. According to Apple, the new human family at the center of this show will have  deep, mysterious connections to Monarch, the mysterious organization that’d been studying Godzilla and the Titans while also working to hide the creatures’ existences from the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hR1GdZ"&gt;Considering how humans have pretty consistently dragged the Monsterverse’s features down in the past, the series is going to have to find a way to legitimately make their plots here feel like more than distractions from the good stuff (read: monster fights). But depending on which monsters show up and how they fight, it might be worth slogging  through a little bit of ground level human humdrum when the show debuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJdsV"&gt;Currently, there’s been no word on when the new Monsterverse series will begin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlAz14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 21, 10:55 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this post misidentified Monarch as the organization that drove the Titans to fight in Godzilla vs. Kong. Apex, the corporation Monarch partnered with in the film, was actually responsible. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirBuddy 2.5 for macOS adds better Bluetooth control for some non-Apple headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvv2vF9wZ1fkFO0fYhG0UJrcE2o=/550x0:2950x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413541/Proximity_Engine_2___No_Text.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 has a new “Proximity Engine” v2 that should detect and hand off peripherals faster. | Image: Buddy Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN1n5y"&gt;A new version of AirBuddy for macOS Monterey is available starting today, adding the option to quickly shift some non-Apple Bluetooth headphones and other devices between Macs and iPhones. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18200945/airbuddy-mac-app-connecting-airpods-bluetooth"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt; AirBuddy app for macOS that launched in 2019 was a simple solution to let AirPods interface with your Mac just as seamlessly as they already did on iOS devices — complete with the animated pop-up many iPhone users are accustomed to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1q72T"&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 takes advantage of new under-the-hood macOS Monterey changes to enable things like low battery notifications, switching from transparency mode to noise-canceling on AirPods that are not even currently outputting sound from the Mac, and easy control over automatic switching between devices. This version also lets power users take advantage of more actions in the Shortcuts app and create automation (to check battery level or quickly connect and disconnect) and profiles. A complete list of the actions that can be performed is published on the &lt;a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/AirBuddy25ReleaseNotes"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HPCDyS"&gt;AirBuddy now works with some third-party devices in macOS Monterey, such as the Sony WF and WH series headsets. These devices don’t have Apple’s W1 or H1 chip, so functionality is limited. They are only shown while connected to the Mac, but can be pinned to the list for quick connection. Battery alerts can also be configured for such devices, as long as they provide battery information to macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="EYd2is"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This one was a “never gonna happen” item on my list, until Apple decided to start showing battery information for some third-party Bluetooth devices in macOS Monterey   &lt;a href="https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB"&gt;https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1483524849565941767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJoC6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was provided a beta release to try out the new features, so we installed it on a Mac running the latest version of macOS Monterey and another Mac running macOS Big Sur (both systems are M1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T_2AlmF8OyQaqczJBTyPe89D4cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182482/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_12.31.03_AM.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKTGX"&gt;I had access to a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds and some LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/29/9217709/samsung-level-u-earbuds-review-neckbuds"&gt;neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; and was able to add them to my devices in AirBuddy on macOS Monterey. Unfortunately, this and some other features did not work in Big Sur since this is a beta release specifically designed for Monterey. The developer plans to release AirBuddy 2.5 for older macOS versions next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84xQTYHJ0XG_jhz18JnZvXu6Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182572/Image_1_20_22_at_1.46_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Tone HBS800 neckbuds also worked!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ4gWQ"&gt;The hero feature of the new AirBuddy is a faster connection switch using what developer Guilherme Rambo (a former &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; writer) is calling Proximity Engine 2.0 — “a complete overhaul of the AirBuddy Bluetooth Low Energy stack that talks to your AirPods, faster and more reliable than ever.” From our testing, AirPods and Beats Solo headsets popped up within a second, which feels faster than how it shows up on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLIdqv"&gt;AirBuddy is not the only app with Bluetooth handoff abilities, but AirBuddy feels more like an OS feature and not an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXKmy8jmvOLQmreIuzPBQewL8hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182418/IMG_1475.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Beats Solo with W1 chip show up just like it would on iOS. For context on why it appears as the Club Collection blue color, I transplanted the parts of the broken Beats Solo 3 into the body of the special edition Space Gray Beats Solo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4L2Lhy"&gt;For me, the most useful feature is easily handing off the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad to a second Mac (available in the previous version of AirBuddy as well). I’m currently working on two MacBook Air M1s, and to swap my Keyboard and external Trackpad between them, I plug a USB-C hub into the computer I want to work on and rely on the Lightning charge cable to re-sync to the other computer. It sounds cumbersome but I’m quick about it. And with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;further delaying&lt;/a&gt; Universal Control (which lets you drag and drop files and windows between two Macs while also using one set of peripherals), AirBuddy is a good wireless KVM-ish type of solution for me, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cut4BOl5EknR-98vedjv95JUgN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182386/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_12.55.54_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A warning for beta users that configured battery alerts may need to be set up again (and assurance that the bug isn’t in the final release). If you’re wondering what Show me a Puppy does, it links to this delightful &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/629448485423385502/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;picture of a zoomy Corgi pup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RaPhpk"&gt;The 2.5 update is available for free to anyone who has purchased AirBuddy 2.0 (as an automatic update on macOS Monterey, with older OSes receiving them next week). For new customers, the price is $9.99 — higher than the minimum $5 charge for the original version but the same price since the 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
