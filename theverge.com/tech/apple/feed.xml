    <title>iPadOS 15 ruined my iPad’s homescreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ediFrrEth4WP4a4mUR1Txvld0dw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897795/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDjasA"&gt;There’s a lot of promise and potential in iPadOS 15. Even with some features like SharePlay missing from the initial release, others like Quick Note and a dramatically simpler approach to multitasking already improve the day-to-day experience of using Apple’s tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeARK"&gt;But Apple sure did manage to bungle the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Us0h3"&gt;As my colleague Chaim mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in his review of iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, the homescreen layout is no longer consistent between vertical and horizontal orientations. I’ve been using the 12.9-inch iPad Pro since 2018, and as of iPadOS 14, the homescreen grid was always 6 x 5 no matter how the iPad was being held. This allowed me to set up dedicated rows for things like photo editing (I edit many of my review photos on the iPad), audio apps, video apps, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Y7qdEYsDxwihGVkkhPjVAB1B28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871871/iPadOS14Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See how icon positioning stayed the same on iPadOS 14? That was nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LvsNsI"&gt;But with iPadOS 15, Apple threw a wrench into all that. When the iPad is in landscape mode, I still get the 6 x 5 layout. But now, as soon as I switch to vertical / portrait, the grid inexplicably changes to 5 x 6, with icons flowing down into the row below them. So much for my attempts at organization and keeping things tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgylnT"&gt;It’s a frustrating change, and it results in a very obvious amount of wasted space at the sides of the screen. The icon spacing in vertical orientation gets almost comical on this large, pixel-rich display if you do drop in some widgets, as you’ll see later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89h7yM"&gt;The best explanation I’ve seen for this reduction in icon density is that it was necessary to support the more flexible widget placement and still keep everything looking somewhat uniform and aesthetically pleasing. It also has to do with how Apple maps out widgets on the homescreen. In his review of iOS and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Federico Viticci surmised that Apple chose to “return to a non-dense grid that allows for both widgets and icons at the same time.” But I’m just not on board. Particularly on iPads, we’re at the point where at least having the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for a more tightly-packed grid would unlock new promise and creativity. Apple still doesn’t even permit empty gaps between icons or widgets. Instead, the company remains weirdly dedicated to its restrictive, always-from-the-top-left placement. -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYVlXj"&gt;I’m sure there are many fantastic widgets out there at this point, and the new XL size — exclusive to the iPad — does open up more possibilities for calendar widgets and other productivity tools. But personally, I just don’t find myself using them often, and I was perfectly okay with the old style of keeping widgets anchored to the left of the main homescreen, where they could be pulled into view when needed and then easily dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7Bo9TghTSuk_fKEwrSbEuWyUSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871872/iPadOS14widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPadOS 14 only supported widgets in the “today view.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ujVpY6"&gt;But then we move on to iPadOS 15. And my first criticism comes right at the start. For some reason, Apple finds it appropriate to plop several widgets onto your iPad’s homescreen immediately after the update, which will throw whatever ordering you had before into disarray. It looks quite bad. Here’s mine on first boot following the iPadOS 15 upgrade, where in portrait we drop from six rows to four... on a 12.9-inch screen… all for the purpose of showcasing widgets:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pgAcDmSv2KTwqXYcaRkjgbuodA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871875/iPadOS15firstboot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homescreen chaos. What a wonderful introduction to a new software update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zhuJxE"&gt;Yikes. What a ham-fisted way of introducing a new feature to customers. Why not just show people a one-time video overlay that &lt;em&gt;explains&lt;/em&gt; these more flexible, put-them-where-you-want widgets instead of wrecking actual homescreens? I’d be irked if some macOS update dumped a bunch of random junk onto my desktop, and I’m similarly annoyed by what Apple’s done here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdruIX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I can’t be the only iPad user to install iPadOS 15 and frown at seeing how its home screen widgets broke up a painstakingly-organized app icon grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Pegoraro (@robpegoraro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/1440091473496707072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRFFgE"&gt;It also illustrates the significant tradeoff that comes with widgets: as soon as you add even one, no matter the size, you’re down to just four rows for that homescreen in portrait mode. On a display as expansive as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that’s brutal. And again, it’s all because of Apple’s fixation with the grid. This is a problem of the company’s own making. At least you can cram a ton of apps into the dock, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="af2GHX"&gt;With a little rearranging, I was able to get back to where things were before — but only in the landscape orientation. As I mentioned earlier, portrait is now limited to a 5 x 6 grid (even when no widgets are present), and there’s no setting to change this back to the old layout. All that wasted space. And for what? This is even noticeable on smaller iPads; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T-UhbAcZd3I"&gt;in his review of the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee couldn’t help but notice the padding on both sides of the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYtdK61eQa2zjm3-9dsMUBgOjhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871888/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_8.58.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UhbAcZd3I" target="_blank"&gt;MKBHD (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the new iPad Mini has wasted homescreen potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9VXBK"&gt;It’s fair to point out that in iPadOS 14, there was wasted screen real estate at the top and bottom of the icon grid when in vertical orientation. But I think it’s far better for familiarity and muscle memory to maintain the same app positioning and layout in both scenarios, so I found that acceptable. This? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lYkfB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPadOS15?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPadOS15&lt;/a&gt; widget and icon placement is absolute madness, especially when changing orientation &lt;a href="https://t.co/wQrFZ7rXYK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wQrFZ7rXYK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Finnen (@danfinnen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfinnen/status/1440039844349034499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz5IAj"&gt;What frustrates me most about the new homescreen is that it’s impossible to make rows for specific purposes, since one icon will always reflow into the next row when you hold the iPad in portrait. Sure, folders exist, but that’s an extra tap. Some have pointed out that iPadOS 15 now allows you to customize different layouts for the homescreen when in portrait or landscape, and it will remember what goes where. But the initial jumbled mess when changing orientations is jarring, and having separate layouts doesn’t fix the issue of icons jumping around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GIR-UTJDerc9Xq59_BdkVltJdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871876/iPadOS15Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With iPadOS 15, the homescreen is 6 x 5 in landscape and 5 x 6 in portrait. (Total icons vary by iPad type and screen size.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="38hdG4"&gt;As of the new update, Apple has also ditched the convenient landscape “today view” that displayed the date and time with widgets underneath — all while keeping your apps in easy reach. Your choices now are to put widgets directly on the homescreen or, if you prefer to keep them off, you can swipe right for this blurred slide-over version, which is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, but less elegant:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1C_itHJ5DiQ7TDYRbxGyelyOhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871878/iPadOS15widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nice homescreen today view is gone, but you can still slide in widgets from the left if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lKba"&gt;Some will see this as a very minor inconvenience and carry on with updating to iPadOS 15 for all of the other benefits. Since the App Library is now there, you can even go in the complete &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; direction and load your homescreens up with widgets everywhere and only a few app icons. If that’s you, don’t let me stop you. On the whole, it’s a very good release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5qRVB"&gt;But I’m really hoping in a future software update, Apple will add a setting to restore the old layout that kept everything more consistent. It’d be even better if the company made the grid more customizable on the whole. If we’re letting people choose between new and old Safari designs, why not offer a choice between having more things on-screen or a less dense grid that’s better optimized for widgets? There’s already a “Home Screen and Dock” section of settings, after all. Letting you adjust the grid to your liking is something that Android phones and tablets already get right. It’s not a huge ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2xBhv"&gt;For me, widgets aren’t worth the homescreen looking different based on how I’m holding my iPad. And I’m not alone, with other iPad owners on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-15-we-are-stuck-with-6x5-apps-on-home-screen-now.2299988/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadPro/comments/pskv7t/ios_15_only_5_icons_per_row/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere venting about these changes. Some of them have downgraded back to iPadOS 14.8 until there’s a solution. I’ve now done so for the second time (I needed those screenshots) even if I’ll miss Quick Note, the much-improved multitasking, and other refinements of iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7OWzt"&gt;I don’t know how long I’ll stay on the older software. Once iPadOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/psplhz/i_dont_want_them_to_fix_this_ipados_15/"&gt;a little more polished&lt;/a&gt; or adds SharePlay back in, I might update. But a familiar homescreen that works the way I expect counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqbGbSGmH85GkDjjYs0cJoIf2Gs=/244x0:2545x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897757/Screen_Shot_2017_09_14_at_11.51.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OBqCUT"&gt;The European Commission has announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Given that most Android-powered smartphones now ship with a USB-C port, the proposals could see Apple finally be forced to move to USB-C on the iPhone. Or they might not, as they could instead force Apple to deliver a portless iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSAFOc"&gt;Today’s proposals from the EU only cover wired charging and don’t seek to enforce rules on wireless charging just yet. A spokesperson for the Commission has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that if a device charges only wirelessly, then there is no requirement to integrate a USB-C charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsiayr"&gt;If the European Parliament adopts the proposals, manufacturers will have 24 months to comply with the new rules. That gives Apple a lot of time to create a portless iPhone if it wants to avoid USB-C altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Lightning connector stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBlGYJBs257ZkkwLiaYzRGZVP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1362261/lightningapple.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Lightning connector has existed for nearly 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjoXg"&gt;Apple has notoriously avoided USB-C on the iPhone, despite adopting it on many iPad and MacBook models. While the EU says its proposals are driven by environmental incentives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;Apple has argued&lt;/a&gt; that a switch to USB-C would actually be worse for the environment because it renders hundreds of millions of Lightning accessories obsolete. These arguments might be irrelevant if Apple goes portless, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZOLVj"&gt;Rumors of an iPhone without any ports have circulated for years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage"&gt;Apple had the “courage”&lt;/a&gt; to kill off the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and make it clear wireless was the future for headphones. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;analysts originally predicted&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s iPhone would ship without any ports, ditching the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojIaWa"&gt;That clearly hasn’t happened with the iPhone 13, but it doesn’t mean it’s not far off. The world of wireless charging is increasingly complicated, and interoperability isn’t always guaranteed, but things are moving quickly. The OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, meaning the phone will fully charge in 43 minutes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;Xiaomi also announced&lt;/a&gt; its next salvo in the wireless charging wars last year, thanks to an 80W wireless charger. Xiaomi claims it can charge a 4,000mAh battery fully in just 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LOzlCNU7jLmQ2z3t-6SttSCcSNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9241503/airpower.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPower didn’t work out for Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7SEIJ"&gt;Apple’s experiences with wireless charging haven’t been as impressive, though. Apple’s AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJaFRk"&gt;The new iPhone 13 Pro supports wireless charging over the Qi standard at up to 7.5 watts and up to 15 watts using MagSafe wireless charging. Both of these are still slower than the fast-charge capable cables you can use to charge an iPhone with. Like anything Apple, the company is probably prototyping better wireless charging methods that will follow years after the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJpOT8"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that Apple has no plans to ditch the Lightning port on the iPhone in “the foreseeable future” and could move straight to a portless iPhone that relies exclusively on its MagSafe wireless charging standard instead. “If the ‌iPhone‌ abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt a portless design with ‌MagSafe‌ support instead of using a USB-C port,“ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;said Kuo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro ships with a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gGULFs"&gt;Such a move could be driven by Apple’s desire to protect its MFi licensing business instead of moving to USB-C. Apple makes money off of every Lightning cable and accessory sold by way of licensing fees from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/"&gt;MFi accessory program&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it captures licensing fees on some wireless charging accessories for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHV8aM"&gt;If Apple is able to move to a portless iPhone before the two-year grace period from the European Commission, it could still be on a collision course for future clashes over charging standards, though. While the EU admits wireless charging is “not seen as a replacement for wired charging at the moment because of the efficiency rates of such chargers,” it does leave the door open to look at this technology at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1G4PP"&gt;“It is also necessary to provide the basis for adaption to any future technological progress by introducing a harmonization of the charging interfaces and the charging communication protocols with respect to radio equipment that may be charged via any means other than wired charging, including charging via radio waves (wireless charging),” says the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH9yl"&gt;If Apple continues to support the Qi wireless charging standard, then it could avoid further scrutiny if it does move to a portless iPhone in the future. But if MagSafe comes to dominate, we could be back in an EU battle over charging standards once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 builds in better customer support for in-app purchases</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzJIk2RCj3x6B9wJ7HInOt-S7a8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895058/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqNtaO"&gt;As part of this week’s launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta&amp;amp;1632329842"&gt;also introduced StoreKit 2&lt;/a&gt;, a set of APIs for in-app purchases and subscriptions. The new Swift-based tools could help developers better track and support the purchases their users make instead of relying on third-party solutions like RevenueCat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlDZfh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/"&gt;The kit introduces new APIs&lt;/a&gt; to “determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, quickly get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription with one simple check,” and most importantly, offer a way for users to manage subscriptions and request refunds in-app. Apple is also updating the App Store server API and App Store server notifications so developers can know when a user’s subscription expires in real time and possibly offer a free extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ba86u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Better customer support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMVmx3"&gt;As RevenueCat notes in &lt;a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/meet-storekit-2"&gt;a blog post breaking down Apple’s changes&lt;/a&gt;, StoreKit 2’s features only work when on devices running newer software like iOS 15. Apps that still support older versions of Apple’s OS — and most of them will for quite a while — &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682105"&gt;are encouraged to use the original StoreKit&lt;/a&gt;. This divide could grow over time: Apple is allowing users &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;to stay on iOS 14 and just receive security updates&lt;/a&gt;, and given how long the company’s products last, there’s likely a lot of old iPads and iPhones kicking around. Luckily, StoreKit 2 and StoreKit are interoperable, “purchases made with the original StoreKit API will still be accessible through the new StoreKit 2 transaction and renewal info APIs,” Apple writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfvAi8"&gt;These changes could make it a lot easier to offer traditional customer support for the purchases made inside apps. For Apple, they’re another small enticement for developers to provide some kind of in-app purchase or subscription, which financially benefits the company thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;increasingly contentious 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t let Fortnite back on iOS until the Epic v. Apple verdict is final</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcsPFKxn9iPAteYcqQizaLx-4F8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893640/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVZADu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; will not be returning to the iOS App Store anytime soon, according to a series of emails &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711467888615431"&gt;published on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmQeCW"&gt;Epic’s iOS developer account had been suspended as a result of the company’s intentional violations of the App Store guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which set the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;the companies’ court battle&lt;/a&gt;. But in the wake of the ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the state of Epic’s iOS apps — particularly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XfAoi4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple lied,” says Epic CEO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui7pQh"&gt;The emails published on Wednesday, both on Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-lied-breaks-its-promise-to-allow-fortnite-back-on-ios-under-its-rules"&gt;and an Epic blog post&lt;/a&gt;, indicate Epic Games’ various apps are unlikely to return to the App Store for the foreseeable future. One letter published by Sweeney — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690"&gt;dated September 21st&lt;/a&gt; and sent by lawyers representing Apple — informs the company that Apple will not reinstate Epic’s developer account until the appeals have been resolved, a process that could take years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxmgQT"&gt;“Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic’s developer program account at this time,” the email reads. “Furthermore, Apple will not consider any further requests for reinstatement until the district court’s judgment becomes final and non-appealable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z88lak"&gt;The message accurately notes that Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, concluded Apple is within its rights to terminate any Epic-related accounts it desires from the App Store. Epic has already paid financial damages for breaching its contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oEzEXJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without a working developer account, Epic can’t re-release Fortnite&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fGLng"&gt;The appeals path for &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is still in flux. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has announced its intention to appeal&lt;/a&gt; the portions of the ruling it lost, although the higher court has not yet agreed to hear the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;Apple has stated&lt;/a&gt; that it’s still considering its options for legal appeal. Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679724/tim-cook-epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-employee-meeting"&gt;told employees after the ruling&lt;/a&gt; that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBPok"&gt;Writing on Twitter, Sweeney framed Apple’s refusal as a betrayal of its earlier pledge to reinstate Epic Games once the company assented to follow the App Store guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PghslO"&gt;“Apple lied,” Sweeney wrote. “Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d ‘welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else.’ Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUrBBg"&gt;Apple declined to comment on Sweeney’s tweets, but did not dispute the authenticity of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOXhPu"&gt;The decision appears to scuttle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666146/apple-epic-korea-fortnite-developer-account-rules-response"&gt;Epic’s attempt to return&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to the iOS App Store in South Korea, which recently passed rules requiring alternate payment method support. It also leaves &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; future elsewhere in question. Epic had recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imgoldenyt/status/1437493375297589248"&gt;updated old copies of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on iOS remotely to remove V-Bucks purchasing options, theoretically putting it back in compliance with Apple’s rules. But without a working developer account, Epic can’t re-release the game in any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1A1xf"&gt;Still, the decision to publish the emails publicly shows that Sweeney is eager to keep pressure on Apple, even if it means keeping &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off of iPhones. “We’ll fight on,” said Sweeney on Twitter. “The need for regulatory and legislative action is clearer than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXcevG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Late last night, Apple informed Epic that Fortnite will be blacklisted from the Apple ecosystem until the exhaustion of all court appeals, which could be as long as a 5-year process. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QCD7wogJef"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QCD7wogJef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="lX8aEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9/22 1:29PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include that Apple declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook says employees who leak memos do not belong at Apple, according to leaked memo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Opj4xCjC4g9vz69eJeot9F-nk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69893014/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jxnEY"&gt;Tim Cook sent an email to Apple employees Tuesday evening about an all-hands meeting that leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week. He said the company is doing “everything in our power to identify those who leaked” and noted that “people who leak confidential information do not belong” at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyp52w"&gt;On September 17th, Tim Cook announced during an internal company-wide meeting that Apple would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679772/apple-vaccine-policy-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated"&gt;requiring frequent testing for unvaccinated employees&lt;/a&gt; — but was stopping short of a vaccine mandate. He also said that he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679724/tim-cook-epic-apple-antitrust-ruling-employee-meeting"&gt;“looking forward to moving forward”&lt;/a&gt; after the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. Shortly after the meeting, both pieces of news leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyulCs"&gt;Now, Cook is tying the news to product leaks — which the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601564/apple-leak-phone-cases-cease-and-desist-trade-secrets"&gt;historically gone to great lengths to track down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0ZSS"&gt;Read the full transcription of Cook’s email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ouaDaK"&gt;Dear Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKTVeL"&gt;It was great to connect with you at the global employee meeting on Friday. There was much to celebrate, from our remarkable new product line-up to our values driven work around climate change, racial equity, and privacy. It was a good opportunity to reflect on our many accomplishments and to have a discussion about what’s been on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH1oP9"&gt;I’m writing today because I’ve heard from so many of you were were incredibly frustrated to see the contents of the meeting leak to reporters. This comes after a product launch in which most of the details of our announcements were also leaked to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hDqzA"&gt;I want you to know that I share your frustration. These opportunities to connect as a team are really important. But they only work if we can trust that the content will stay within Apple. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything in our power to identify those who leaked. As you know, we do not tolerate disclosures of confidential information, whether it’s product IP or the details of a confidential meeting. We know that the leakers constitute a small number of people. We also know that people who leak confidential information do not belong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZuzat"&gt;As we look forward, I want to thank you for all you’ve done to make our products a reality and all you will do to get them into customers’ hands. Yesterday we released iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, and Friday marks the moment when we share some of our incredible new products with the world. There’s nothing better than that. We’ll continue to measure our contributions in the lives we change, the connections we foster, and the work we do to leave the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYdPUg"&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVUzUt"&gt;Tim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>iOS 15.1’s first beta suggests we could see SharePlay soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YnyT9jGz12swQUpHyi1jxKduWE=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69891587/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4zR8p"&gt;SharePlay has returned in the iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-1-beta-1-re-enables-shareplay-feature-following-delay/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple delayed the major iOS 15 feature&lt;/a&gt; to “later this fall” instead of having it launch alongside the OS upgrade as planned. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;not the only feature&lt;/a&gt; that’s hasn’t made it to release yet, but it could be a useful one during the ongoing pandemic — it lets you watch videos, screen share, or listen to music with other people over a FaceTime call. Its existence in Tuesday’s new beta could indicate that it could be coming sooner than later, though that’s not a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIWUKs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 15.1 beta also lets users add their COVID vaccine card to the Wallet app, once you’ve first added it to Health. Similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;Google’s version of this feature works&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to get your vaccine info from your medical provider or your state’s healthcare system before you can add it to your phone. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=7h3vwlh5"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; the feature uses the SMART Health Card format, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.commontrustnetwork.org/verifier-list"&gt;supported by a handful of states and some major vaccination providers&lt;/a&gt;. The list includes states like California, Hawaii, New York, and Louisiana, as well as pharmacy providers like CVS, Rite Aid, and Walmart, but you can click the link for the full details. As always, check with your local healthcare provider for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBb0fAMdqijdEosAZ6EFa_PFPzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868514/2048.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add verified vaccine records from certain health providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gO6R9t"&gt;These features showing up in the iOS 15.1 beta don’t necessarily mean they’ll be in the final iOS 15.1 release — after all, SharePlay was introduced during the iOS 15 beta, but was later removed. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F21%2F22686897%2Fios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still say&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will ship “later this fall,” and there’s only so much time left for that (plus, it would be a bit odd if it was removed from &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; beta). The vaccine card feature will be included in an “upcoming software update,” according to the company, so it’s possible it’s further out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdzwDB"&gt;It also may be a bit before we see iOS 15.1, given that iOS 15 was just released yesterday (iOS 14.1 &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;came about a month after&lt;/a&gt; iOS 14). But if this early beta is any indication, it could be bringing some nice new features with it when it does show up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get iOS 15 right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4621G9VcG1A83UwdytSuZtJWvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890176/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvuWwU"&gt;iOS 15 is finally here, and while it can’t be called a revolutionary update, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;enough cool new features&lt;/a&gt; that you may not want to wait until Apple notifies you that the update is ready. It’s easy enough to get the update without waiting, though. Here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JN0zOp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;Your phone is backed up&lt;/a&gt;, right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdmYBQ"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7duHTw"&gt;Give it a moment. If the update is ready for you, it may appear on your update screen. In that case, tap on “Install Now.” You’ll probably be asked for your passcode and will have to agree to Apple’s “Terms and Conditions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NwBlhb7wPAfb-e43zShyRdsfrgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867904/IMG_0B14C4232371_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your update to iOS 15 may be waiting for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Apple updates macOS Safari with a new look, but you can turn off the big changes  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClwxmS1tx6h35I4zaLj-NSLsmnU=/72x0:3033x1974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69889701/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_10.13.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f7yYKY"&gt;Apple has released a redesigned version of Safari for macOS Big Sur and Catalina. The update, announced as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, was released the same day as iOS and iPadOS 15, bringing the web browser’s new look and features across Apple’s platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhGyTy"&gt;To update to the new Safari 15, you can go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Software Update, where it should automatically refresh and show up. Unlike updates to macOS, you shouldn’t have to reboot your computer after updating Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifbP7h"&gt;The development behind this version of Safari has been interesting. The full OS update that it was originally a part of, which also brings features like Universal Control and Quick Notes, isn’t here yet, but Apple decided to ship the new Safari anyway. For those who have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;upgraded to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a good thing — it means that you can immediately use tab groups across all your devices. The update &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F21%2F22686070%2Fapple-macos-safari-tab-groups-redesign-change-back" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also includes features&lt;/a&gt; like better tracking protection and automatic switching to HTTPS for sites that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K1ya7BytHYBoR43IHnYVerGzVSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867613/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.13.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s original vision for Safari 15, which has been toned down slightly over the beta period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pPxAad"&gt;While the Safari update brings new features, it also brings a new design. Apple’s made several changes to it since it was announced (though not as many as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;it’s made to Safari for iPhone&lt;/a&gt;), tweaking it to be less starkly minimal. Looks-wise, it’s still a major change from Safari 14, but there are preferences that you can tweak to walk back some of the more distracting changes. If you don’t want websites to be able to change the color of your tab bar, you can go to Safari’s preferences &amp;gt; Tabs, and uncheck “Show color in tab bar.” If you want your tabs to be on their own row, you can switch from Compact mode to Separate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7gw4O1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10765531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BhnTyGRWTeUiCyHZHXIlGTEjqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867568/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.50.16_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “I prefer the old Safari” config.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CBUpAT"&gt;Unchecking “Automatically collapse tab titles into icons” turns the tab bar into a sort of carousel when you have too many of them. I certainly don’t prefer it, but it’s an option if that’s your sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhpaRgyCNx2coIns0bGV37hs-JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867576/Screen_Shot_2021_09_21_at_9.52.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unchecking the “automatically collapse tab titles” box hides the true chaos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux5zvl"&gt;While Safari 15 takes a bit to get used to (I'm still getting over the learning curve myself), Tab Groups is a great feature to share between my iPhone and computer. Safari 15 also comes with the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212816"&gt;usual host of security updates&lt;/a&gt;, though none seem too severe. After you update, be sure to let us know what you think of the new design — is it a breath of fresh air or just another refresh that you’ll grudgingly get used to?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M7RUpi_d1NvC6dms8FN9DTfueyo=/35x0:1925x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888574/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Ninth_Gen_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new iPad launches on September 24th at the same starting price as the last-gen model: $329.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFnM4H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only Apple device launching on September 24th — and we’re not just talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;2021 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;new entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; during its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, which comes outfitted with a new front-facing camera, a faster processor, and double the base storage. But are the improvements enough to justify an upgrade from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;last year’s iPad&lt;/a&gt;, or even picking it over its predecessor should you find the 2020 model on sale? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtWRe"&gt;To answer those questions, we’ve put together a comparison outlining the similarities and differences between the 2020 iPad and the forthcoming model, ahead of our official review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q5ZEcA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"},{"title":"The Apple rumors were wrong","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZ_LWLoLuu5J6bEtDlAoP8QPgW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859056/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Connect_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad features a 12MP front camera, which should allow for improved visuals during calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bRdkia"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TjCqm6"&gt;A 12MP ultrawide front-facing camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zXb2Or"&gt;Greater storage capacity, with base storage starting at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6T2vb"&gt;The A13 Bionic chip, replacing the A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DN1aVS"&gt;A True Tone display that adjusts color temperature to match your environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="QRGUCd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TR4t1L"&gt;Undoubtedly, one of the biggest selling points of the new iPad is its front-facing camera, which is a higher resolution than the 1.2MP camera found on the 2020 model. On paper, the this should translate to better video quality, whether for videoconferencing, livestreaming, or other activities. The newer model also provides support for 1080p recording at 25fps and 30fps, while the 2020 version only supports 1080p at 30fps. Additionally, the newer iPad can “follow” the subject as they move around the frame thanks to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;new Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, once reserved for the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyVT2g"&gt;There are also some notable improvements when it comes to the display, storage capacity, and performance. Unlike last year’s model, the latest iPad sports twice the capacity at 64GB and 256GB storage variants instead of 32GB and 128GB. In addition, thanks to Apple’s True Tone technology — something Apple introduced in 2016 with the first-gen iPad Pro — the display on the new entry-level tablet can adjust its color temperature to match your environment. If you’re outside, for example, the display will automatically adjust to be easier on your eyes. Finally, the 2021 model features Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is 20 percent faster than the A12 Bionic chip found in the eighth-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S2BoiQ"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i2kFG4"&gt;The 8MP rear camera with f/2.4 aperture and digital zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAQvQz"&gt;Slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v15Er8"&gt;The overall design — height, width, depth are identical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VrGhsf"&gt;Lightning connectivity (no USB-C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zygx3w"&gt;They both have a headphone jack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P6YCYp"&gt;The list of compatible accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC34dY"&gt;Battery life, which Apple quotes at nine to 10 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Js4ra"&gt;Wi-Fi 5 and optional LTE connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XAYdAe"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oxxrXk"&gt;In most other ways, the 2021 iPad is identical to its predecessor. The improved front-facing camera should mean better video calls, but aside from that, the device sports the same 8MP wide camera with an f/2.4 aperture on the rear, support for HDR, and a digital zoom. Both tablets also feature similar video recording capabilities, offering slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GNifIWvm_UZCunuitsSeh4gspI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859063/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_ProCreate_Pencil_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the 2020 and 2021 iPad feature an LCD display with 2160 x 1620 resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZB6C"&gt;Design-wise, they’re nearly the same, meaning the newer tablet remains compatible with existing accessories like Apple’s Smart Keyboard and still has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a novelty among Apple’s current device lineup and modern devices in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWgK0z"&gt;Unlike the all-new iPad Mini, however, the 2021 iPad still features a home button with a Touch ID sensor and a Lightning port instead of USB-C, a frustrating liner note that’s also applicable to iPhone 13 models. Both are only compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil, too, which isn’t nearly as convenient to charge as the second-gen model released in 2018. While the new model charges wirelessly while magnetically docked to the side of the iPad Pro and latest iPad Air and iPad Mini, the last-gen Pencil still relies on the tablet’s Lightning connector and awkwardly juts out the bottom of the device when charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Deycqe"&gt;Both iPads are available in space gray or silver — no gold colorway this time around — with a 10.2-inch display and 2160 x 1620 resolution. They even weigh about the same; only the Wi-Fi version of the new model weighs a little less: 1.07 pounds, as opposed to 1.08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w74709"&gt;Apple claims battery life is also identical across both devices, with the new iPad offering between nine and 10 hours of battery life, depending upon whether you’re using a cellular connection or Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, the 2021 model boasts twice the storage for the same price. The Wi-Fi-equipped iPad with 64GB of storage now starts at $329 — the same price the last-gen model started at with 32GB of storage. The newer model is also available in a 256GB configuration for $150 more, whereas the 2020 model could only be purchased in either 32GB or 128GB varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEll5t"&gt;As for the operating system, both models are compatible with iPadOS 15. The only difference is that the 2021 iPad comes with it pre-installed — eighth-gen iPad owners will need to download it. That means no matter which model you choose, you’ll be able to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls with Android and Windows users in a pinch&lt;/a&gt;, resize your widgets, filter notifications via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus mode&lt;/a&gt;, and make use of a host of new iPadOS 15 features. With the final release of macOS Monterey later in the fall, you’ll also be able to drag and drop content between devices using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w2Wrqe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: fundamental fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrX4eoQf6IHAkTM73kLYPYG2RUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859204/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_SplitView_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kywy7Z"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2020 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RdQj5g"&gt;It’s still a good tablet, likely with years of support ahead of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXzWg6"&gt;You really dig the gold colorway or the white bezels on the silver model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57ijOI"&gt;Unlike the forthcoming iPad Mini, the latest entry-level iPad is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676532/apple-event-iphone-13-incremental-refinement-upgrade-specs"&gt;more of a refinement&lt;/a&gt; than a notable overhaul. It doesn’t feature a USB-C port or compatibility with the second-gen Apple Pencil, nor does it ditch the home button in favor of an edge-to-edge display. It’s still the most economical tablet in Apple’s lineup, however, and even the incremental upgrades are enough to render it an even better value at $329 than it was before. The faster performance afforded by the A13 Bionic is welcome, as is an upgraded 12MP camera at a time when we’re still all connecting virtually more often than we are in person. It even offers double the storage for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWWBw1"&gt;For some people, the subtle improvements will be enough. But for most? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bU1j6qbU7MsjLoMjDf7M-BCaIkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859274/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Family_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 iPad (second from the right) remains Apple’s most affordable tablet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p9EaqZ"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a new tablet and not just to upgrade, though, the choice gets a little easier when you consider availability. Apple officially discontinued the 2020 iPad with the introduction of the ninth-gen model, and though we routinely saw last year’s model discounted to as low as $300 over the past year, it’s recently been unavailable at nearly every retailer. Even if you wanted to pick up the 2020 model, you can’t, making the 2021 iPad the cheapest Apple tablet you can pick up outside of a used or refurbished model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPFmXm"&gt;If you regularly use your iPad to make video calls or livestream, the new front-facing camera may be enough reason to upgrade — or if you’re really hard-pressed for storage space. Outside that, though, you might be better off waiting for a more substantial refresh to Apple’s entry-level tablet or spending the extra $200 or so on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet equipped with an even faster processor, a larger display, and a USB-C port, along with a host of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
