    <title>Godzilla and the Titans will reunite in new Apple TV Plus Monsterverse series</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5a1d"&gt;Though Legendary’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made waves last summer by debuting on HBO Max and quickly becoming one of the platform’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/godzilla-vs-kong-opening-weekend-analysis-1234943958/"&gt;top performing features&lt;/a&gt;, the next time we see the titanic monster and his fellow kaiju, they’ll be calling new streamer home: Apple Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ucS26"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/apple-tv-lands-epic-godzilla-and-titans-original-television-series-based-on-legendarys-monsterverse/"&gt;Apple Plus announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has greenlit a new live-action series set in Legendary’s Monsterverse from co-creators Chris Black (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) and Matt Fraction, writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;run that the recent Disney Plus series heavily draws from. Along with Black and Fraction, Toho’s Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita and Safe House Pictures’ Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell are set to executive produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary’s Monsterverse logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d6RF7z"&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, the new untitled series is said to feature Godzilla, a number of the Titans, and yet another human family whose interpersonal dramas audiences are &lt;em&gt;meant &lt;/em&gt;to care about even though the literal monsters are what everyone’s really interested in. According to Apple, the new human family at the center of this show will have  deep, mysterious connections to Monarch, the villainous organization responsible for driving Godzilla and Kong to brawl with one another when last we saw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3eVgs"&gt;Considering how humans have pretty consistently dragged the Monsterverse’s features down in the past, the series is going to have to find a way to legitimately make their plots here feel like more than distractions from the good stuff (read: monster fights). But depending on which monsters show up and how they fight, it might be worth slogging  through a little bit of ground level human humdrum when the show debuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJdsV"&gt;Currently, there’s been no word on when the new Monsterverse series will begin production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirBuddy 2.5 for macOS adds better Bluetooth control for some non-Apple headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvv2vF9wZ1fkFO0fYhG0UJrcE2o=/550x0:2950x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413541/Proximity_Engine_2___No_Text.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 has a new “Proximity Engine” v2 that should detect and hand off peripherals faster. | Image: Buddy Software&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN1n5y"&gt;A new version of AirBuddy for macOS Monterey is available starting today, adding the option to quickly shift some non-Apple Bluetooth headphones and other devices between Macs and iPhones. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18200945/airbuddy-mac-app-connecting-airpods-bluetooth"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt; AirBuddy app for macOS that launched in 2019 was a simple solution to let AirPods interface with your Mac just as seamlessly as they already did on iOS devices — complete with the animated pop-up many iPhone users are accustomed to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1q72T"&gt;AirBuddy 2.5 takes advantage of new under-the-hood macOS Monterey changes to enable things like low battery notifications, switching from transparency mode to noise-canceling on AirPods that are not even currently outputting sound from the Mac, and easy control over automatic switching between devices. This version also lets power users take advantage of more actions in the Shortcuts app and create automation (to check battery level or quickly connect and disconnect) and profiles. A complete list of the actions that can be performed is published on the &lt;a href="https://v2.airbuddy.app/AirBuddy25ReleaseNotes"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HPCDyS"&gt;AirBuddy now works with some third-party devices in macOS Monterey, such as the Sony WF and WH series headsets. These devices don’t have Apple’s W1 or H1 chip, so functionality is limited. They are only shown while connected to the Mac, but can be pinned to the list for quick connection. Battery alerts can also be configured for such devices, as long as they provide battery information to macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="EYd2is"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This one was a “never gonna happen” item on my list, until Apple decided to start showing battery information for some third-party Bluetooth devices in macOS Monterey   &lt;a href="https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB"&gt;https://t.co/9qZ1yhZYfB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1483524849565941767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJoC6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was provided a beta release to try out the new features, so we installed it on a Mac running the latest version of macOS Monterey and another Mac running macOS Big Sur (both systems are M1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T_2AlmF8OyQaqczJBTyPe89D4cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182482/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_12.31.03_AM.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKTGX"&gt;I had access to a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds and some LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/29/9217709/samsung-level-u-earbuds-review-neckbuds"&gt;neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; and was able to add them to my devices in AirBuddy on macOS Monterey. Unfortunately, this and some other features did not work in Big Sur since this is a beta release specifically designed for Monterey. The developer plans to release AirBuddy 2.5 for older macOS versions next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I84xQTYHJ0XG_jhz18JnZvXu6Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182572/Image_1_20_22_at_1.46_PM.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Tone HBS800 neckbuds also worked!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ4gWQ"&gt;The hero feature of the new AirBuddy is a faster connection switch using what developer Guilherme Rambo (a former &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; writer) is calling Proximity Engine 2.0 — “a complete overhaul of the AirBuddy Bluetooth Low Energy stack that talks to your AirPods, faster and more reliable than ever.” From our testing, AirPods and Beats Solo headsets popped up within a second, which feels faster than how it shows up on iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLIdqv"&gt;AirBuddy is not the only app with Bluetooth handoff abilities, but AirBuddy feels more like an OS feature and not an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXKmy8jmvOLQmreIuzPBQewL8hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182418/IMG_1475.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Beats Solo with W1 chip show up just like it would on iOS. For context on why it appears as the Club Collection blue color, I transplanted the parts of the broken Beats Solo 3 into the body of the special edition Space Gray Beats Solo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4L2Lhy"&gt;For me, the most useful feature is easily handing off the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad to a second Mac (available in the previous version of AirBuddy as well). I’m currently working on two MacBook Air M1s, and to swap my Keyboard and external Trackpad between them, I plug a USB-C hub into the computer I want to work on and rely on the Lightning charge cable to re-sync to the other computer. It sounds cumbersome but I’m quick about it. And with Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832765/universal-control-apple-macos-monterey-ipad-delay-spring"&gt;further delaying&lt;/a&gt; Universal Control (which lets you drag and drop files and windows between two Macs while also using one set of peripherals), AirBuddy is a good wireless KVM-ish type of solution for me, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cut4BOl5EknR-98vedjv95JUgN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182386/Screen_Shot_2022_01_19_at_12.55.54_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A warning for beta users that configured battery alerts may need to be set up again (and assurance that the bug isn’t in the final release). If you’re wondering what Show me a Puppy does, it links to this delightful &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/629448485423385502/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;picture of a zoomy Corgi pup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RaPhpk"&gt;The 2.5 update is available for free to anyone who has purchased AirBuddy 2.0 (as an automatic update on macOS Monterey, with older OSes receiving them next week). For new customers, the price is $9.99 — higher than the minimum $5 charge for the original version but the same price since the 2.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s head of comms is leaving after less than a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tFaT8eBJvboBnGos5OGy4bVUSq4=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413485/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dedh8I"&gt;Apple is renowned for a culture of secrecy, one that’s managed in no small part by the company’s head of communications. But it’s had a hard time filling that role, with the most recent entrant — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-taps-stella-low-as-new-communications-chief"&gt;Stella Low, formerly Cisco’s PR chief&lt;/a&gt; — now leaving after less than a year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjgpi"&gt;Fifteen-year Apple vet Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261"&gt;according to journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-new-head-of-pr-kristin-huguet?d_id=3072577&amp;amp;ref=bftwfwd&amp;amp;utm_source=dynamic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=bftwfwd"&gt;BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that she’s been promoted effective immediately, as Low leaves to spend more time with her family. The previous comms boss, Steve Dowling, left in September 2019, and Apple left the role open for nearly two years before hiring Low last May. (During that time, long-time Apple marketing and App Store boss Phil Schiller reportedly stood in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5v1V2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Longtime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; PR exec (15 years) Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over as VP, Worldwide Comms of the world’s most valuable company, a very big job given all the regulatory issues, products to come (hello AR glasses &amp;amp; autonomous cars) and the metaverseness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBYobq"&gt;Between Dowling and Low, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;Apple became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, got itself into the (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893546/epic-apple-fortnite-appeal-app-store-restrictions"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and became embroiled in all kinds of scrutiny from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/11/20859972/apple-antitrust-app-store-search-tax-warren"&gt;antitrust enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;app store users&lt;/a&gt;, and its own employees — the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;could maybe bring its fortress of secrecy toppling down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUkbSl"&gt;Apple’s PR chief before that, Katie Cotton, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/11627500/goodbye-to-all-that-today-is-katie-cottons-last-day-at-apple"&gt;set the tone for the company’s communications&lt;/a&gt; for 18 years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794104/apple-is-reportedly-looking-for-a-friendlier-head-of-public-relations"&gt;Apple was reportedly looking for a “friendlier, more approachable” successor&lt;/a&gt; after she left. I’m curious if the company’s relationship with the press will change again now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushes to overturn App Store ruling in opening appeal brief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfiBnPuc2aWphDwXvOUKu6dKoKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413310/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzTaud"&gt;Epic Games has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182876-epic-appeal-opening-brief"&gt;its opening brief&lt;/a&gt; to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn the previous ruling that Apple’s control over the iOS App Store does not qualify as a monopoly. The company first gave notice of it appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but Thursday’s filing is the first time it has laid out its argument at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123RE"&gt;“Epic proved at trial that Apple retrains trade...by contractually requiring developers to exclusively use Apple’s App Store to distribute apps and Apple’s IAP for payments for digital content within apps,” the filing reads. “If not overturned, [the district court] decision would upend established principles of antitrust law and...undermine sound antitrust policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAcyoS"&gt;Epic’s first legal challenge to Apple’s App Store restrictions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;came to a finish in September&lt;/a&gt;, when a district court ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;roll back some restrictions on in-app payments&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise cleared the company of antitrust charges. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;A separate appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been filed to reverse the new in-app payment rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KICvp"&gt;In her ruling, Judge Gonzales Rogers was particularly ambiguous on the question of whether Apple held monopoly power over the mobile gaming market. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” she wrote in the decision. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0wyxZ"&gt;In the appeals brief, Epic seems determined to revisit that question, and draw a clearer link between the iPhone’s success as a mobile gaming platform and a potential monopoly case against Apple. “The district court’s factual findings make clear,”  the filing alleges, “that Apple’s conduct is precisely what the antitrust laws prohibit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL3C3o"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple emphasized the broad scope of economic activity taking place on the App Store, as evidence of its ongoing competitive value. “In its ruling last year, the district court confirmed that Apple is not a monopolist in any relevant market and that its agreements with app developers are legal under antitrust laws,” said Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg. “We are confident that the rulings challenged by Epic will be affirmed on appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G19eu0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included statement from Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai are personally lobbying senators against antitrust legislation: report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wCISDb"&gt;The United States’ biggest tech companies are seriously worried about new antitrust legislation. So much so that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have been personally “calling and meeting with senators,” urging them to oppose the mooted legislation, according to a &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/punchbowl-news-am-1-18-22/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Punchbowl News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that cites “​​multiple Senate aides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZJVRO"&gt;The legislation in question is &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The legislation is currently in its early stages, and is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee today. The bill would need to pass votes from both the House and Senate to become law, but it’s still easy to see why it’s ruffling feathers with Silicon Valley’s biggest beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VJSCyS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The legislation only affects the biggest US tech firms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAJ6oL"&gt;The legislation prohibits online platforms from advantaging their own “products, services, or lines of business” over those of rivals. It applies only to the biggest tech companies: Apple, Amazon, Facebook-owner Meta, and Alphabet’s Google (though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/u-s-antitrust-bill-expanded-to-include-tiktok-tencent-s-wechat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it will be expanded to cover Chinese tech giants TikTok and WeChat, too). These platforms would be barred from behavior like biasing search results in their favor, limiting rivals’ access to platform data, and using non-public data from customers to compete against them (activities that companies including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changed-search-algorithm-in-ways-that-boost-its-own-products-11568645345"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544921/european-commission-google-antitrust-investigation-ad-tech-advertising-services"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are accused of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztjJyh"&gt;Although the exact impact of the legislation is difficult to predict, one aspect that worries Apple in particular is a possible threat to its App Store business model. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;letter sent by the company&lt;/a&gt; to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Apple said that if the bill became law it would be forced to allow users to “sideload” apps onto iPhones and iPads as it does Macs — meaning installing them from sources outside the App Store. Apple says this threatens the security of its users by allowing unvetted apps onto devices, and cuts into one of its main revenue streams (Apple collects up to 30 percent commission on App Store sales). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EZF9j"&gt;In response to Apple’s arguments, a spokesperson for Klobuchar &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The bill does not force Apple to allow unscreened apps onto Apple devices. All of Apple’s arguments about ‘sideloading’ really amount to a desperate attempt to preserve their app store monopoly, which they use to charge huge fees from businesses they are competing against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVoGXM"&gt;Although the Klobuchar-Grassley bill is roundly opposed by tech’s largest companies, smaller players have &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;come out in support of the legislation&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of 35 tech firms recently wrote a letter to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee arguing that the legislation is necessary to curb “the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYvh3v"&gt;“For too long, dominant technology companies have made it difficult for other businesses to compete in the digital marketplace by abusing their gatekeeper status to give themselves and their partners preferential treatment and access on their platforms,” said the letter’s signatories, which include DuckDuckGo, Patreon, Sonos, Wyze, and Yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYg3I5"&gt;It’s not the first time Big Tech’s top executives have personally mobilized against antitrust legislation. Last year, when US politicians were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;considering five new antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546286/apple-tim-cook-nancy-pelosi-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-lobbying"&gt;called Speaker Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; to “deliver a warning” against the impact of “rushed” legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to clean your $19 Apple cleaning cloth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OUWNdpAMJQaWMPg0BN1He4njZkE=/143x0:1859x1144/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410545/MM6F3_AV2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t just throw it in the wash.&lt;/em&gt; | Image of cloth: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fkw4NC"&gt;Here’s the scenario: you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;managed to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s hottest product, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;$19 polishing cloth&lt;/a&gt; meant for cleaning nano-texture screens and other Apple devices. But oh no! Instead of hanging it up with the rest of your priceless artifacts, you accidentally used it to actually clean something, and now it’s &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfully, Apple has bestowed us with a guide on how to make our cloth good as new, and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/19/apple-explains-how-to-clean-its-polishing-cloth-without-buying-a-new-polishing-cloth/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; has brought those instructions to our attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="howto-title"&gt;Are you ready? Here’s how Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210229"&gt;“How to clean the nano-texture glass on your Apple display” support article&lt;/a&gt; describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p6tXWq"&gt;1. Hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxbtus"&gt;2. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJZx08"&gt;3. Allow the polishing cloth to air dry for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vuuGd8"&gt;The instructions have been on Apple’s website for at least a few months, according to the WayBack Machine, but despite a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-polishing-cloth"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/26/apples-cleaning-cloth-is-sold-out-through-january----get-this-instead"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them, I hadn’t come across them. That’s really a shame — other people who also hadn’t known about the instructions might’ve been throwing away their priceless polishers all because of a little grime, wasting $20 simply because the cleaning instructions are buried on a support page instead of being included on a tag, or embossed on the cloth itself. (I would also settle for prime placement on the Apple home page, where all people of the cloth spend their day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0Mv0"&gt;The instructions themselves are also a little disappointing — ultimately, Apple is telling us to wash the cloth like we would any other delicate fabric. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878673/apple-polishing-cloth-in-stock-online"&gt;At least it’s back in stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Plus teases its WeWork series with Jared Leto</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qaqc5gTRluquHR5cZVdYm-1xw40=/0x0:4664x3109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70410005/Apple_TV_WeCrashed_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JTUWwi"&gt;A new trailer gives us a glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming miniseries about the real-life buildup and dramatic downfall of WeWork, the coworking space with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;weirdly bombastic public filing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975831/wework-layoffs-ipo-adam-neumann-softbank"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; thousands of employees while later giving its brash CEO a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926583/wework-founder-adam-neumann-softbank-takeover-payout"&gt;huge golden parachute&lt;/a&gt;. The script practically writes itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urg8uV"&gt;Jared Leto stars as WeWork’s former eccentric CEO, Adam Neumann, while Anne Hathaway takes on the role of his wife, Rebekah Neumann, who served as the company’s chief brand and impact officer and was former CEO of WeGrow. The trailer opens with Leto reimagining a run-down building as a vibrant office space — and then making that vision a reality. Leto and Hathaway are then seen leading a “WeWork” chant in front of a crowd, emphasizing the almost hypnotic energy of the company and its leaders. The company managed to secure a $47 billion valuation before ultimately plummeting to just $9 billion as the company went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1hC4"&gt;The series is based on the &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;Wondery podcast &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is set to debut on Apple TV Plus on March 18th, with new episodes airing every Friday until April 22nd. Last year, Hulu created a documentary that followed the WeWork rollercoaster ride, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22358602/wework-documentary-adam-neumann-hulu"&gt;called &lt;em&gt;WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fe9Z1y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQP4VVuyrY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwKHAI"&gt;Also coming to Apple TV Plus is &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt;, a series that depicts the ultimate balance between work and home. Adam Scott plays Mark Scout, a manager at Lumon Industries, who undergoes a procedure called “severance.” The procedure splits Scout’s (and his co-workers’) personal and work-related memories — when he’s at the office, he has no memory of his home life and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLrnjA"&gt;The trailer shows what seems to be Scout’s verbal acknowledgment of the procedure’s risks. It also previews the robotic interactions that take place between him and co-workers, as well as hints at a darker mystery brewing inside the workplace. &lt;em&gt;Severance&lt;/em&gt; premieres on February 18th and is produced by Ben Stiller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s Boost Charge Pro is a $60 MagSafe puck with a kickstand and braided cable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ymzF4VRYu34a_agF_PV6_giTyo=/0x123:1000x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70408973/webdam.web.1000.1000.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cable is also a meter longer than Apple’s version.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mbMu6O"&gt;Belkin’s new Boost Charge Pro wireless charging pad takes Apple’s MagSafe puck and ... well, makes it “pro” with a 2-meter-long braided cable and a kickstand for propping your phone up to make it easier to see while it’s charging (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/18/belkin-launches-magsafe-charger-with-kickstand/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It also comes in black, a must for any accessory sporting the pro moniker. There is a bit of a catch, though — like many accessories with official MagSafe certification, it doesn’t come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BZjfn"&gt;At $60, which it’s listed at in both the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1087099/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinBoostChargeProNewsPost011922&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPT72ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2-pro-portable-wireless-charger-pad-with-magsafe-special-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fmagsafe-magnetic-accessories%2Fmagsafe%2Fboost-charge-pro-portable-wireless-charger-pad-with-magsafe-15w%2Fp%2Fp-wia004%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F19%2F22890567%2Fbelkin-boost-charge-pro-magsafe-puck-kickstand-braided-cable-expensive-chargers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin&lt;/a&gt; stores, the Boost Charge Pro costs significantly more than &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1087099/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinBoostChargeProNewsPost011922&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXH3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-charger" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s $40 MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, which was already seen as a bit on the pricy side. Yes, you do get that kickstand, and having a longer cable is definitely a plus. But is it really worth an extra $20, especially considering that you may need to budget for a USB-C charging brick, as it’s not included with either option?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ScN-V7xljU_DRjkbjNT6mJtOjDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23178248/HPUC2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll admit it does look good in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C0BeEF"&gt;This is a familiar story with MagSafe; despite the technology launching with the iPhone 12, MagSafe certified charging accessories aren’t particularly common. Amazon is full of MagSafe &lt;em&gt;compatible &lt;/em&gt;wireless chargers that’ll magnetically attach to your phone (some of them even have a kickstand!), but they’re almost certainly going to max out at 7.5W of charging instead of the 15W that MagSafe affords on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt;non-Mini iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. (It’s also worth noting that some Amazon vendors still advertise their charging pucks as being capable of putting out 15W, but the listings usually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;admit that number is only achievable on Samsung phones.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ55d3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The handful of MagSafe accessories that are out have eye-popping prices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JekqBu"&gt;When manufacturers do come out with MagSafe accessories, the prices are often eye-popping. Perhaps one of the most infamous instances is Belkin’s $40 Car Vent Mount Pro with MagSafe, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;&lt;em&gt;is not capable of charging your phone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But Belkin is far from the only company putting out pricy MagSafe accessories — &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/18/mophie-magsafe-travel-charger/"&gt;Mophie just announced&lt;/a&gt; a $150 three-in-one travel charging mat that has a MagSafe phone charger, an Apple Watch charging puck, and a (presumably Qi) charger for AirPods. Apple’s own MagSafe Duo Charger, which doesn’t include that extra AirPod pad, will set you back $130. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0fdA8"&gt;Compared to those products, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1087099/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinBoostChargeProNewsPost011922&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPP82ZM%2FA%2Fmophie-3-in-1-stand-for-magsafe-charger" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mophie’s $90 three-in-one stand&lt;/a&gt; that’s meant to stay at home almost seems reasonable — except for the fact that you have to bring your own MagSafe puck, putting its price in line with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1087099/7613?subId1=VergeBelkinBoostChargeProNewsPost011922&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPU82ZM%2FA%2Fbelkin-boost%25E2%2586%2591charge%25E2%2584%25A2pro-3-in-1-wireless-charging-pad-with-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s similar $150 home charging mat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SuTcSh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging"},{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sVKV2e"&gt;This isn’t to say that MagSafe is bad or that these manufacturers should feel bad. It’s just that over a year since they were first introduced, MagSafe accessories are still quite expensive. And while Belkin’s latest puck doesn’t buck that trend, it is at least nice to have a MagSafe charger with a longer, braided cable that you won’t have to buy a separate stand for. It’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;not as cute as Belkin’s charging tree&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="jisN9F"&gt;If you’re looking to light up your home with smart home tech for less, Philips Hue is selling an E26 starter kit containing &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-ambiance-starter-kit-e26/046677530297#specifications" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four white ambiance smart bulbs and a Hue Bridge for just $59.99 instead of $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time low. These steep discounts come well after Philips Hue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650951/hue-light-tube-gradient-filament-brighter-bulbs"&gt;launched new 1,100 lumen smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s likely offering this steep discount on the 800-lumen bulbs looped into this deal until they’re sold out for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMmVIq"&gt;These popular smart bulbs can be customized with adjustable smart timers, and they allow you to set different hues of white light, with a warmer color temperature to help you relax, or a brighter, cleaner color temp to help you focus. You can also pair the bulbs with your existing setup via the Bridge, which uses the Zigbee protocol, thus allowing you to control it all with the most popular smart home ecosystems, including Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa. The included Bridge allows you to set lighting routines, control varied scenes, and connect up to 50 lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="TxLqqe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sengled’s newest smart bulb can track your heart rate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"},{"title":"All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vtyYaI"&gt;Whether you travel often, or perhaps you just frequently forget where you placed your keys, Apple’s AirTags can be helpful in a variety of situations. These Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth trackers make it easy to monitor and find missing items that they’re attached to by using Apple’s Find My app, which taps into the expansive Find My network, allowing any iOS device within range to send the location of your AirTag to you. Each tracker has the ability to make a chirping sound when requested, and its user-replaceable battery should last for up to a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWF5NC"&gt;Unfortunately, like most Apple products, they’re usually a little costly, which is why today’s modest discount on a four-pack is notable. Typically $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532AM-A-AirTag/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling four AirTags for $94&lt;/a&gt;. It usually costs $29 for each AirTag, so with this deal, you’re spending about $24 per tracker instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="05MRqr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873581"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nop9oI"&gt;For those on the market for a security camera deal, Arlo makes some good-quality devices — one of which is $120 cheaper today. Arlo’s $599.99 Ultra 2 Spotlight wireless security system &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HRSWY37?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is on sale at Amazon for $479.99&lt;/a&gt;, matching its best price to date. The deal includes two security cameras that run on rechargeable batteries and boast an ultra-wide 180-degree lens, which can zoom into objects and record video in 4K with HDR. Other notable features include free local storage from the Arlo Smart hub, colorized night vision, two-way audio, a siren, and support for HomeKit, Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DnSCzW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10984187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Amazon is once again selling the Apple Watch Series 7 at its best price ever. Regularly $399, the green, 41mm GPS model and its matching Sport Band are selling for $339 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrIjyP2Ouw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $60. Best Buy is also throwing in an additional month of Apple Fitness Plus with each purchase. Compared to the previous generation, the Series 7 boasts a larger display than its predecessor, and features IP6X dust and water resistance. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bvNuzB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCyaQB"&gt;Gamers shopping for a new entry-level wireless mouse can get a swell deal on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s G305 Lightspeed in black for just $32.42 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (normally $49.99). That’s just $3 shy of its best price ever and a 35 percent total discount on the lightweight mouse, which sports six programmable buttons, a 12K DPI sensor, and built-in USB receiver storage so you can easily stow it when you need to take it on the go. The peripheral, Logitech claims, is also capable of lasting up to 250 hours on a single AA battery. If you’re not a fan of the black colorway, the white model is on sale for $39.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrJ9Pj6Egg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s5IihW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Smixhg"&gt;Here are some other great tech products you can save on today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8z2tx6"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling the standard edition of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLXaEfFlf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch for just $37.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $56.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hqn2yC"&gt;If you’re on the market for an affordable, basic smart 4K TV, Best Buy is selling the 55-inch configuration of TCL’s 5-Series QLED TV for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgrLTrOrt6G" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 instead of $649.99&lt;/a&gt; right now. The retailer is also offering additional perks with each purchase, including a $50 discount on a Google Nest Hub.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google split with startups over antitrust bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wokii9"&gt;As the Senate Judiciary Committee inches towards passing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;legislation that could loosen Big Tech’s grasp on consumers&lt;/a&gt;, Big Tech is expectedly outraged. Both Apple and Google have written letters publicly opposing new pieces of legislation, while a coalition of smaller tech companies has voiced their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEN952"&gt;The outcry comes in response to two pieces of proposed legislation: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents Big Tech from favoring their services over others, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;Open App Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to promote competition on app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oN5xKr"&gt;Apple’s senior director of government affairs, Tim Powderly, penned a letter, viewed by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL), Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the panel’s ranking Republican, Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and the subcommittee’s ranking Republican, Mike Lee (R-UT), criticizing the legislation. Powderly says the bills, particularly the Open App Markets Act, would be detrimental to the safety of the App Store, as it would allow users to sideload apps, also known as downloading an app from a third-party source. Since these apps exist outside of the Apple ecosystem, they aren’t subject to the same &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-security-overview-sec35dd877d0/web"&gt;safety and security standards&lt;/a&gt; that apps must meet to earn a spot on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eKpApl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cChANh"&gt;“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Powderly writes. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLt3Dx"&gt;Downloading an app from outside the App Store wouldn’t subject them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users choose the kinds of data (if any) that apps are allowed to track. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tim-cook-claims-sideloading-apps-would-destroy-security-and-privacy-of-ios/"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook said&lt;/a&gt; sideloading “would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we’ve built into the App Store where we have privacy nutrition labels and app tracking transparency, where it forces people to get permission to track across apps.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act"&gt;Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi has spoken out against sideloading&lt;/a&gt; as well, stating that it “undermines security and puts people’s data at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OBO7"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;Apple currently collects a 15 to 30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; on any in-app purchases on apps downloaded from its App Store. The company prevents developers from incorporating alternate payment processors for this very reason, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the prevailing issue behind the Epic v. Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885065/apple-netherlands-dating-apps-third-party-payment-options"&gt;Apple recently conceded to the Dutch government&lt;/a&gt; to allow dating app developers to include other payment options, however, the company says it will still take a commission from those purchases, and it’s unclear how much that commission will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GqMZTP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse” and “less relevant” products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hC6OJa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/"&gt;In its own post&lt;/a&gt;, Google made a similar case against the “legislation being debated in the House and Senate,” arguing it would not be able to offer the “best” services to consumers if the antitrust laws pass. Since the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would prevent Google from prioritizing its own services ahead of others, the company claims it may not be able to offer consumers the best online experience, as users may be swayed by other apps that apparently just aren’t as good as Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8AVll"&gt;The company says the legislation could harm “US technological leadership” by giving Americans “worse, less relevant, and less helpful versions of products like Google Search and Maps.” Google also claims it would prevent the company from integrating security features into its apps and services by default, such as its SafeBrowsing service and spam filters in Gmail and Chrome, which block pop-ups, viruses, and malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvQINa"&gt;“We believe that updating technology regulations in areas like privacy, AI, and protections for kids and families could provide real benefits. But breaking our products wouldn’t address any of these issues,” Kent Walker, the president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet explains. “Instead, it would eliminate helpful features, expose people to new privacy and security risks, and weaken America’s technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtGU9O"&gt;Like Apple, Google also charges developers a 15 to 30 percent commission on apps and in-app purchases. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;Dozens of states filed lawsuits against the company&lt;/a&gt; last year, citing that the practice violated antitrust policies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;Epic Games also sued Google in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the company’s payment restrictions on the Play Store constitute a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="exa816"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTLa9I"&gt;But there are still several other voices, albeit a bit smaller than Apple and Google, voicing their support of the legislation. Companies including Wyze, Yelp, DuckDuckGo, and the Tor Project, &lt;a href="https://wesupportsb2992.medium.com/re-s-2992-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act-f49cc61abd87"&gt;posted a letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Chairman Durbin and ranking Republican Grassley to vote “yes” on the American Innovation and Choice Online Act. The companies say that Big Tech’s dominance and “gatekeeper status” have prevented them “from competing on the merits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYeU3J"&gt;“Dominant technology companies can: use manipulative design tactics to steer individuals away from rival services; restrict the ability of competitors to interoperate on the platform; use non-public data to benefit the companies’ own services or products; make it impossible or complicated for users to change their default settings or services or uninstall apps,” the letter states. “These tactics not only harm competition, but also deprive consumers of the innovative offerings a vibrant market would yield.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7XW71"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549025/big-tech-antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google-house-judiciary-jim-jordan"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee passed a package of six similar antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt;, none of which have become law. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to review the bipartisan American Innovation and Choice Online act later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
