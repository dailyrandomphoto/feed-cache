    <title>Tidal now also offers offline listening on the Apple Watch</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Ek5G"&gt;Music streaming service Tidal is now available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, allowing subscribers to stream music directly to Apple’s wearable or download it for offline listening. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; both announced similar offline listening features for the Apple Watch last week. Subscription prices for Tidal start at $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpKOR7"&gt;Tidal has historically sold itself on the quality of its audio streaming, offering features like lossless playback and even hi-res streaming before many of its bigger rivals. But this year, some of its biggest competitors are starting to catch up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify’s lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; is set to launch later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;Apple Music will introduce support&lt;/a&gt; for lossless and hi-res streaming next month. Tidal’s high audio quality won’t translate to its Apple Watch app however. The music service has confirmed audio will be limited to 96Kbps on the wearable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;like Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f8uVMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal is facing renewed competition from Spotify and Apple Music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4wHzl"&gt;The service’s other major selling point is the amount it pays artists in royalties to stream their music. Analysis &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Digital Music News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; puts Tidal’s rates ahead of Spotify, Apple, and Deezer, and it looks like this artist-supporting trend is set to continue after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s financial services company Square recently acquired a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming service for $297 million. Dorsey specifically cited wanting to find “new ways for artists to support their work” as the reason for the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV11Ry"&gt;“Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals and we’ll do the same for artists,” the CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460914149003271"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewwp6Q"&gt;Tidal’s Apple Watch support requires a Series 3 model or later running watchOS 7.1. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flexibits’ contact app Cardhop gets fresh revamp, added to Fantastical subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KBwBLItdssAbe70WYumqc-wRgE=/332x0:2495x1442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338916/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntEZaa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop"&gt;Flexibits&lt;/a&gt; — best known for its popular calendar application, Fantastical — has a new, overhauled version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16488490/cardhop-contacts-app-announced-fantastical-flexibits"&gt;contact management application Cardhop&lt;/a&gt; out today, which updates the app with new features and a fresh coat of paint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okjI9n"&gt;But most importantly, like Fantastical before it, Cardhop is also switching to a subscription model. The contact app is being added for free to the existing Fantastical Premium subscription that Flexibits introduced last year. And to mark that expanded scope, Fantastical Premium is also getting a new name: Flexibits Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rAnGkz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS and Mac calendar app Fantastical is moving to a subscription model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DCOHPu"&gt;The original Mac and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18280578/cardhop-app-contact-management-ios"&gt;iOS versions&lt;/a&gt; of Cardhop previously cost $19.99 and $4.99, respectively. However, similar to Fantastical, Flexibits will now be offering a more limited, free version of both of those applications to anyone, with more advanced functionality (including many of the new features being introduced with the new version of the app) locked to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfNZuv_zi4IjQXJbNHchfh2ibdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536968/cardhop.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0l8s"&gt;Flexibits, crucially, isn’t changing the price of its subscription program to go with the newly added app. Flexibits Premium will still cost $4.99 a month or $39.99 a year for an individual user, or $7.99 per month or $64.99 per year for up to five family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8Z4FH"&gt;Existing Cardhop owners will still be able to access any features that were already present in their existing apps from before the switch to the subscription model without having to pay (also similar to the Fantastical switch). They just won’t get any major &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; features going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNwhgPAJDRHlzRw1gHLZ9GMK9Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536973/Relationships_Family_Tree.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mqKU3I"&gt;Cardhop 2.0 does add a variety of new features, though. There’s a new Relationships mode, which can generate family trees for contacts that you’ve set relationships between or — if you have Google or Office 365 accounts linked — org charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDkunN"&gt;The iOS version of Cardhop has a new business card scanning feature, which does exactly what it says on the can, and there are new widgets for both macOS and iOS that can be customized to add quick links to call, text, or interact with a contact using any of Cardhop’s actions. (Want a link to quickly FaceTime a friend? Now you can.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idww5freXqEprE-bD1SNNdphMoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536965/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_5.22.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SDYFJq"&gt;And given that Cardhop and Fantastical are now bundled together, there are also some deeper ties with the Flexibits calendar app. A new “Invite with Fantastical” action makes it easy to invite contacts (or whole groups of contacts) to events. Scanning a business card also gives an option to quickly follow up with an instant calendar meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrT2Ek"&gt;The new version of Cardhop is available to download now for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple stayed on message while Epic filled out the record</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8klKtHRvaVYWrvOmobOmGIRUsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69336515/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1FSSBv"&gt;Sure, “hot-tubbing” &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; fun, but in a court context, it’s just a judge encouraging lawyers to argue — which is how &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; ended today. Not with a bang but with a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuGmB"&gt;In honor of the trial’s final day, a raft of spare lawyers were in the gallery, representing Epic and Apple. But everyone who spoke to the judge — Epic’s Gary Bornstein and the three lawyers who handled the end of the case for Apple, Dan Swanson, Veronica Smith Moye, and Richard Doren — had their backs to the gallery the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU1n2W"&gt;Throughout the trial, Epic’s general strategy appears to have been to stuff the record as full of evidence as possible — just in case it’s needed on the inevitable appeal. To do that, Epic sacrificed telling a coherent story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4vmxWH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxNHLE"&gt;Apple, on the other hand, was on brand. It had a clear story and it spent the entire trial hammering it home: Apple controls the App Store because the alternative would be a security and privacy nightmare. Whether it was Swanson, Moye, or Doren at the podium, this story didn’t waver, just as it mostly didn’t waver throughout the rest of the trial. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Tim Cook biffed this&lt;/a&gt; by citing a business model and not mentioning security.) Phil Schiller, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;Apple’s marketing guru&lt;/a&gt;, sat at the table with the lawyers throughout the trial; from time to time, I found myself wondering how involved he was in crafting the lawyers’ messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDbVsS"&gt;Both parties agreed that the top two issues of the day were market definition and remedies. Who you will agree with in the end is going to depend on how the market is defined, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt1hH4"&gt;For Epic, we’re talking mobile app stores, and the question of the operating system on the phone is key. After all, even though Samsung and LG and whoever else make phones, from a developer’s point of view that doesn’t matter. You’re making games for Android or iOS. This seems fairly sensible, particularly after Schiller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441304/apple-phil-schiller-epic-iphone-testimony-app-store"&gt;cited extremely minor competition&lt;/a&gt; in his testimony: Amazon’s Fire tablets and Microsoft’s failed Windows phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X57l1x"&gt;It is less clear to me why game consoles should be excluded as competition. Apple, obviously, wants to say there’s a &lt;em&gt;great deal&lt;/em&gt; of competition — but to tell the truth, my initial reaction to this antitrust trial was, “But can’t you just play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on a console?” Epic’s Bornstein mentioned that most consoles aren’t mobile; as the owner of a handheld Nintendo Switch, I strongly disagree! Bornstein had, of course, thought of this — the Switch doesn’t connect to wireless networks, he said, and thus is not truly “mobile.” By this standard, anyone who owns an iPhone that has the functionality for data over the cellular network switched off — perhaps because they are a child and a parent handled this setting, or perhaps because they are just cheap — also doesn’t truly own a mobile phone. That seems incorrect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6o8Lwo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“But can’t you just play ‘Fortnite’ on a console?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0myP52"&gt;Hilariously, Apple’s Swanson pointed out that it is not the ‘90s. What he meant was that we don’t just have one device — multiple devices are much more the norm than they used to be. If all these devices are substitutes for each other, then what does it matter to users if they have to use a PC or a console to get to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;? Some testimony we heard from Apple’s experts earlier in the trial suggested that 80 percent of iOS players were making their in-app purchases elsewhere, Swanson reminded us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARkpvM"&gt;The reason the market definition matters so much is clear: if I agree with Apple’s view that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a game, and the competitive market is basically anywhere I can buy a game, Epic has no case. But if I agree with Epic’s view that the relevant market is mobile app distribution, then Apple’s refusal to allow any apps that aren’t in the app store on the iPhone is pretty unquestionably monopolistic. This is where Epic’s failure to tell a clear, simple, and coherent story sets its case back. Even if I agree that Apple has at times deliberately hamstrung its competition — and I do agree with this, otherwise there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;no green bubbles on iMessage&lt;/a&gt; — I still can’t say in simple language why consoles aren’t an acceptable substitute for gaming on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipjXDh"&gt;But leave that aside. I’m not the judge, after all! And Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that it was possible Epic’s proposed remedy — allowing other app stores onto the iPhone and allowing side-loading of apps — &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt; consumer choice. After all, she suggested, people are generally aware of Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem and are choosing it on purpose. Besides, she noted, the cost of apps in Google’s store was roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF8g7z"&gt;Well, Epic’s Bornstein said, that’s because it’s a duopoly. There is only one place in the record where Apple concerns itself with pricing pressure: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418828/apple-app-store-commission-30-percent-phil-schiller-2011-epic-lawsuit"&gt;a 2011 email from Schiller&lt;/a&gt;, asking if at some point Apple may have to lower their commission. Apparently, pricing competition still hasn’t caused Apple to lower its commission, unless a lawsuit counts as “competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zYgfwN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This line of questioning suggested that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="batGhH"&gt;See, Apple’s small developer program, which dropped the commission for certain studios, seemed to be the result of &lt;em&gt;this lawsuit&lt;/em&gt; more than anything else. (“The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Gonzales Rogers said last week&lt;/a&gt;.) This skeptical line of questioning suggested, at least to me, that Gonzales Rogers agreed there isn’t competitive pressure on Apple’s pricing. That’s probably welcome news for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nsP7c"&gt;The day’s other hot topic was remedies — if Apple does indeed have a monopoly and is acting anti-competitively with it, what should be the outcome? Epic wanted to prohibit the restrictions that make the App Store the sole option for downloading apps on iOS — which would mean allowing both side-loading and other game stores on the iPhone. Epic also wanted to get rid of the requirement that in-app transactions for digital goods must use Apple’s in-app purchase processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBo2lk"&gt;To Apple, this just meant that Epic wants to use Apple’s IP — like developer tools — without paying for it. After all, Apple’s Doren pointed out, the company could have only allowed its own apps on the iPhone, as it did with the very first one (which was promptly jailbroken so other apps could be loaded, but never mind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gq9539"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers seemed skeptical about the remedies. Besides the IP question, which there was a healthy back-and-forth about, she asked Epic’s Bornstein to cite some cases where courts required businesses to totally change their business model. Well, there’s Microsoft, Bornstein said. Yes, but that case had been brought by the government, and Epic is not the government. In fact, Gonzalez Rogers said, Epic hadn’t shown her a single comparable antitrust case where the kind of ruling Epic was requesting had been granted by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gtNJV"&gt;Setting aside the fact that I am not a mind reader nor a judge, what I heard in court today didn’t sound like a win for Epic. Yes, the record is stuffed full of times Apple behaved badly. But the question isn’t whether Apple has always behaved well. I walked out of court feeling Apple had the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYxTTz"&gt;Of course, all the evidence Epic crammed on the record may serve them beyond an appeal. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Amy Klobuchar has said she’s watching this trial closely&lt;/a&gt;. So even if Epic loses this battle, its strategy may win the war — by creating new antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.6 now available with new Apple Podcasts subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ynrvr-lLBWkVE-FcWLjMfyREk2g=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334814/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFiP3s"&gt;Apple is releasing its latest iOS 14.6 update today, and it’s largely focused on audio improvements. This new OS update will allow Apple Music subscribers to enable lossless audio or Dolby Atmos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;once it’s available next month&lt;/a&gt;, and it also debuts Apple Podcasts subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnw8CA"&gt;Podcasts users can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscribe to content&lt;/a&gt; in the app for extra perks like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. Apple is also improving the Podcasts app with the ability to mark all episodes as played, recover old episodes, and remove downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6cqHT"&gt;iOS 14.6 includes a number of other quality-of-life improvements. If you’re an AirTag owner, iOS 14.6 includes the option to add an email address as a contact method for when the item tracker is in lost mode. There’s also Apple Card Family sharing, with support for up to five people to share an Apple Card for purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8fYXO"&gt;As always, this latest version of iOS also includes some fixes and security improvements. Apple has fixed an issue with the Apple Watch not unlocking an iPhone correctly, problems with reminders as blank lines, call blocking extensions not appearing in settings, reduced iPhone performance during startup, and Bluetooth issues during calls.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after future update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOtKaw-P1xfh2CUMir5x-DtzEic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328285/jbareham_180202_2266_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier will require external devices like a USB DAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSkBY0"&gt;Apple uses the document to tout its “commitment” to providing customers with the best possible listening experience. It talks up both AAC — claiming that the format has become “virtually indistinguishable from the original studio recording” as encoding methods have evolved — and its Apple Digital Masters initiative. I continue to think that Apple is much more excited about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos mixes coming to Apple Music than anything to do with lossless itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8J91M"&gt;The document also reiterates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;what Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the AirPods Max: when listening to audio via the Lightning-to-3.5mm cable, the company says it’ll sound fantastic, but it won’t technically be “lossless” due to an analog to digital conversion that occurs in the cable. Apple again confirms that lossless quality will be exclusive to Apple Music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YM2kOC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I redownload my iTunes purchases in lossless?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7OrM"&gt;If you subscribe to Apple Music, you can redownload music in lossless only from the Apple Music catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vYKo36"&gt;The straightforward answer to the question as written is really a flat “no,” but obviously Apple wants to nudge people towards its subscription service. Apple Music will offer over 20 million songs in lossless quality at launch in June, and that total will reach over 75 million by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLa-l7Gi7acAzhS7HlzqN7CSsE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328196/1233030839.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point of view is one of the most important issues of the century, and safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built upon,” he explained to an Apple attorney, echoing countless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;iPhone ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. “Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people tools to circumvent that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VthQ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhsVpC"&gt;Supporting side-loaded apps would remake iOS, and it’s much easier for Cook and Apple to outline the potential downsides. Giving users control creates risk, and Cook argued that people choose iOS specifically so they won’t have to make risky decisions with sensitive data. “We’re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services,” he said. “I just don’t think you replicate that in a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNnDYU"&gt;Epic mustered its own arguments: people can still choose to keep their phones locked down, and they might want to access stores with even more carefully curated apps or even better privacy controls. It’s previously accused Apple of hypocrisy, pointing out anecdotal failures to catch specific apps (like a game called &lt;em&gt;Ganja Farmer: Weed Empire&lt;/em&gt;) that violate App Store guidelines. “It’s not 100 percent. It’s not perfect. You will find mistakes being made,” Cook said when Apple’s counsel asked about those incidents. “But if you back up and look at it in the scheme of things, with 1.8 million or so apps on the store, we do a really good job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WXYt"&gt;Luckily for Apple, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t demonstrated much interest in completely opening up iOS. She’s asked a steady trickle of questions about in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering provisions&lt;/a&gt;, and the structure of individual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;apps like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely about third-party app distribution or sideloading. (One of those rare incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;seemed critical&lt;/a&gt; of Epic, too.) While Rogers’ questions don’t necessarily indicate how she’ll rule, there’s a fairly conspicuous lack of requests for more detail or clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h78mEu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azAogS"&gt;But losing mandatory in-app purchase commissions would still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;be a big blow&lt;/a&gt; for Apple. Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately. He was also, however, a little blunter about Apple’s own interests. “IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission” — for payment processing, but also customer service and the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Without in-app purchases, “we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess.” If Apple let developers tell users about other payment methods, Cook said later, “we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUlxWp"&gt;Apple called an expert yesterday to describe how its multibillion-dollar research and development costs help developers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/21/6746613/first-games-ios-8-metal-graphics-available-download"&gt;through APIs like Metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15725994/apple-mobile-ai-chip-announced-wwdc-2017"&gt;CoreML&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not necessarily sinister for Apple to profit from these investments. But unlike better privacy and safety features, higher profit margins don’t directly improve consumer welfare, the key standard in antitrust trials. Judge Rogers ended Cook’s testimony with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;some of her most interesting questions yet&lt;/a&gt;, grilling Cook on whether in-app game purchases — like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; V-Bucks and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; gold — were effectively subsidizing the rest of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cicn8i"&gt;Rogers doesn’t seem to personally &lt;em&gt;like &lt;/em&gt;video game microtransactions; she’s mused multiple times about potentially predatory impulse buys. But it matters that she singled out games. Epic has pushed to make this suit cover all App Store purchases, while Apple has been trying to limit it to digital video game sales. (That’s why witnesses spent so much time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;trying to define a game&lt;/a&gt;.) Cook’s interrogation suggested that even if iOS stays intact and “gamers” are the only audience in question, Apple still has battles left to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7k5orjsovbwa93KfYhmNRG8TLQI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327773/bfarsace_200407_3962_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g3kM5"&gt;It’s safe to say that no company in existence today that has more than a couple of employees can exist without a knowledgeable IT support person or team. When you’re trying to run a website, create a solid technological structure, and keep things running even at the most stressful of times, a strong IT support team can make sure that things don’t go completely haywire at the worst time — or, if it does, that somebody is there to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1VUdX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is certainly no different, and so we asked one of the members of Vox Media’s IT team — Eric Arredondo, IT administrator — to tell us a bit about himself and his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="us5hNN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10508485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qsKelo"&gt;What do you do for Vox Media?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cgVAW7"&gt;I am an IT administrator for our IT service desk team. I help manage and support the internal systems, applications, and hardware that keep the company operating. My team’s responsibilities cover a wide range of needs to support our various networks and departments, ranging from hardware asset management like the company computers to employee account creation or email support. Essentially, our work is to help everyone do their best work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="D9ira7"&gt;How has your job changed during the pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1QUdA1"&gt;Our general mission has remained the same, for the most part, but supporting our company entirely remotely has brought up new challenges. We definitely ship a lot more than ever, supporting our company’s current work-from-home environment and trying our best to give the same level of service as we would in the office. We try to help supply any equipment necessary for users to get their work done and emulate the office experience at home as best as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaxvAb"&gt;Interestingly enough, it’s sometimes the small things that used to take a few minutes to do in person that have proven to be the most challenging. For example, in the old times, I could just walk over to a user’s desk and assist right away, whereas now it’s much more hands-off, talking a user through troubleshooting over Slack or Zoom. Additionally, in the office, we can control the network that the team connects to and utilizes — it’s easier than dealing with each user’s own respective ISPs and router issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbjLwc"&gt;We’ve always been a pretty remote-friendly company, though, which helped my team with the transition to fully remote work. It’s definitely made us more efficient than ever, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KENpFn"&gt;What hardware tools do you and your colleagues use? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9a8j"&gt;Generally, everything we need to do can be done via our computers, with most of our admin work being done via software or SAAS (software as a service) apps. I work on an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeEricArrendoIT052121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, and while I have a desk with a monitor and such, I’ll generally work all over my apartment, sometimes from the backyard. I do have a loud mechanical keyboard, a &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron K2&lt;/a&gt;, that sits at my desk with fun lights and a lot of key travel. It’s something I probably wouldn’t have put my office neighbors through, but at home, I’ll happily type on a loud, clicky keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yyQ8iK"&gt;
&lt;div id="BTAq9c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ayQuqT"&gt;
&lt;p id="4yshO3"&gt;I also use an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJ2R2LL%2FA%2Fmagic-trackpad-2-silver&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeEricArrendoIT052121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Magic Trackpad 2&lt;/a&gt;, as I prefer it to an external mouse, and use a &lt;a href="https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand360.html"&gt;Rain Design mStand360&lt;/a&gt; to prop up my computer at my desk. I could probably do with a more supportive desk chair, but I sit in a Supreme director’s chair in my WFH office, mostly because I like how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B73LZs"&gt;My label printer, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DYMO-LabelWriter-Thermal-Printer-1755120/dp/B002M1LGJ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dymo LabelWriter 4XL&lt;/a&gt;, has also been getting a lot of use during the pandemic, in regards to the aforementioned shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Xzbt6x"&gt;
&lt;div id="c4CjWG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10508786"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="aSKUdf"&gt;
&lt;p id="1dSQZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What software tools do you and your colleagues use? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zIiFd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is probably the obvious one, along with Gmail and other Google Workspace services. Aside from using those tools ourselves, we also serve as admins in those environments with elevated management permissions, providing support and guidance to the various users and teams who use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He1ikY"&gt;We use &lt;a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; as our ticketing service, using it to manage all the various requests we get from across the company. Another tool we utilize is &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/"&gt;JAMF&lt;/a&gt;, a hardware management tool we have installed on all company computers, and that is useful for widespread asset management, pushing out software and policies, as well as installing our various security tools remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6pSC2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone wanted to get into IT, how would you suggest they go about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOXEZ3"&gt;I got my training, experience, and certifications originally from my retail work. But there are a lot of online resources that can help you get an idea of what modern companies expect from a technology perspective, and what skills can be developed, such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itpro.tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22444109%2Fit-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ITPro.tv&lt;/a&gt;, an online learning center for IT standards and certifications, as well as tutorial videos on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lynda.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22444109%2Fit-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lynda (now called LinkedIn Learning)&lt;/a&gt; or even Youtube for specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NCVSs"&gt;The job is pretty evenly split between technical knowledge and customer service, so you also have to be really good at talking to people, being able to support and guide with both empathy and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s excuse for no AirTag in Siri Remote: it’s too thick to easily lose in your couch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDODHZJGTumbrLb4XbxSIy9WYxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69326700/DSCF3923.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0Qos8"&gt;We have poked a &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; amount of fun at the Apple TV’s Siri Remote over the years, and we’re pleased to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;it’s finally fixed&lt;/a&gt; — except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;the headsmacking decision &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to stick the company’s AirTag UWB locator technology&lt;/a&gt; into one of the few gadgets absolutely, positively guaranteed to get lost in your couch cushions someday. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPSKR"&gt;Today, Apple VP Tim Twerdahl &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;answered that burning question&lt;/a&gt; in perhaps the most unsatisfactory way imaginable: simply, that the new TV remote’s thick enough you shouldn’t need to worry about that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMTTIH"&gt;Here’s the whole exchange &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;between Twerdahl and &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup’s &lt;/em&gt;Patrick O’Rourke&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38EvNI"&gt;Q: Was there ever any thought to adding some sort of AirTag-like technology in the Siri remote? I’m always losing the remote in my couch cushions and it seems like it would be a great idea. Did Apple not bother because the ‘Find My’ network is more designed for use outside of the home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l66XrV"&gt;Twerdahl: We are super excited about AirTags and what we’re doing with U1, and part of that power is the Find My network and the fact that we can leverage a billion devices around the world to help you find stuff. To your point, that is the most powerful out of the home. With the changes we’ve made to the Siri Remote — including making it a bit thicker so it won’t fall in your couch cushions as much — that need to have all these other network devices find it seems a little bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXgDT3"&gt;I would have perhaps bought “we tried it and it drained the battery too quickly” or “we finalized the Siri Remote before AirTags were ready” or even “it cost too much to hit our target price.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml2s0N"&gt;But thickness? My Roku remotes got swallowed by my couch cushions &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt;, and those thick suckers had AA batteries and full-size headphone jacks inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CMm1d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch says&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s right about one thing, though — compared to the original Siri Remote’s thinness, it’s an improvement where couches are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook faces harsh questions about the App Store from judge in Fortnite trial</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78jNcW"&gt;Apple called CEO Tim Cook to conclude three weeks of testimony in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple — &lt;/em&gt;and with the end of the trial approaching, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers engaged Cook in a surprisingly tense exchange over Apple’s business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eenHBa"&gt;Rogers noted that most of Apple’s App Store revenue comes from games, and she asked Cook why developers can’t use other payment methods to sell in-app purchases, or at least tell users they can make those transactions elsewhere. “If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ghs6I"&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8dhc5"&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="me8v4C"&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pdOXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwpJQ"&gt;But Rogers didn’t sound convinced. She asked why Apple wouldn’t take a cut of something like a banking app transaction: “You don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.” When Cook said it was because Apple specifically charged for digital goods sales, Rogers noted that Apple itself had defined that rule — saying it was a deliberate choice of business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuVPpw"&gt;“I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="welc1v"&gt;She also said it didn’t sound like Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;recent App Store price drops&lt;/a&gt; were motivated by competition — just fear of regulation and lawsuits. “The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” said Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dx3UEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cook says Apple’s commission covers tech, customer service, and a giant user base&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yodJ6"&gt;Cook replied that after Apple had lowered some commissions to 15 percent, Google did the same, indicating that there was competition, but the judge was dismissive of this argument. “I understand perhaps that [was the issue] when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrBGnO"&gt;The heart of the issue, for Rogers, seems to be a survey that indicates 39 percent of developers were “somewhat” or “very” dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. “How is that acceptable, and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?” she asked Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8kR4H"&gt;Cook said that sometimes, developers’ and users’ needs conflict — and Cook emphasized in his earlier testimony that Apple puts users first. But he acknowledged that he didn’t regularly get surveys on developer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70gzES"&gt;We won’t know the verdict of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; for weeks or months, and there’s one day of arguments left in court. The exchange with Cook doesn’t necessarily tell us how Rogers will eventually rule, and it certainly doesn’t mean Epic will get some of its bigger demands met. It does suggest, however, that Rogers is seriously considering Epic’s argument that Apple has too much control over one specific part of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYF5bM"&gt;You can find the full exchange between Rogers and Cook below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bCJKd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;At the beginning of your testimony, you indicated that you wanted to focus on users. I’ve seen evidence that a significant portion of revenue from in-app purchases comes from gamers. Have you seen evidence to that effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udVoFP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I have, your honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8dSZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And it’s incredibly significant — compared to all other users, revenue is coming from gamers more than anyone else, am I right in my current understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdYBsZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The majority of the revenue on the App Store comes from games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PI8oVX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And in-app purchases in particular, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="766va2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wao55I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The other thing you said is that you want to give users control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juPrX9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. For their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xskhWD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So what is the problem with allowing users to have choice, especially in a gaming context, to have a cheaper option for content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unMSkU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think they have a choice today. They have a choice between many different Android models of smartphone or an iPhone, and that iPhone has a certain set of principles behind it, from safety and security to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4y6hk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But if they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option? Or at least the information that they can go and have a different option for making purchases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIQXzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whMFY9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But you could also monetize it a different way, couldn’t you? I mean, that is, the gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLxXaM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The bulk of the apps on the App Store are free, so you’re right that there is some sort of subsidy there. However, the way I look at that, Your Honor, is that by having such a large number of apps that are free on the store, it increases the traffic to the store dramatically, so the benefit somebody gets is a much higher audience to sell to than they would otherwise if there weren’t free apps there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGPu0l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So your logic then is that it’s more of a customer base, not an IP, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XOPK7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s both, because we need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcii3J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But let me ask you, so banking apps. I have multiple banking apps, I haven’t paid for them, but I suspect other than the $99, you don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cvuTc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;In the gamers example, they’re transacting on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02eamZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;People are doing lots of things on your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZI2HM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;But this is a digital transaction with an observable change in currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xr423"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s just a choice of a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni40Ij"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve made a choice. There are clearly other ways to monetize, but we chose this one, because we think this one overall is the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Zfxs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s quite lucrative. But it seems to be lucrative and focused on purchases that are being made frankly on an impulse basis — that’s a totally different question, about whether that’s a good thing or not, it’s not really right for antitrust law — but it does appear to be disproportionate. I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bvk7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I view it differently than you do, Your Honor. I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there. We do that with a lot of free apps, so [even if] we don’t collect a commission from them they bring a lot to the table. And then we have the majority of other people that pay 15 percent, and only the people that are really profiting in a major way are paying 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xakG44"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but the 15 percent, right... you would agree with the basic proposition that competition is good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VtTbm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think competition is great. We have fierce competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD5lbN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have competition in those in-app purchases, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meLsrP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I mean somebody could go if they’re a gamer they could go buy it on the Sony PlayStation or the Microsoft Xbox or the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdOVHr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Only if they know, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0LSTm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but that’s up to the developer to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrdELJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And only if they decide to switch in terms of how they do things, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJjt2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Usually people have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17YFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGgxQA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something from a COVID point of view, and then electing to instead of doing something very temporary, to do something permanent. And of course we had the lawsuits and all the rest of the stuff in the back of our head, but the thing that triggered it was, we were very worried about small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkfwFU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, but it wasn’t competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsAWRf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was competition after we did our 15, it was competition that made Google drop theirs to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hcSO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;I understand perhaps that when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMPFJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something for small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDyM1T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So when other stores reduced their price, Steam reduced their price, you felt no pressure to reduce your price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNEa3r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with Steam and their financial model. One of the things that’s missed here is that there’s a huge competition for developers. It’s not just competition on the user side, it’s also with the developer side, in addition to the users. You can imagine that if we had an above-market kind of commission, people just wouldn’t develop for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkopGC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about developers. I’m seeing evidence in the record that there’s a survey of developers — I’m going to share the results of this bar graph that was presented to me. I don’t know how accurate it is, because I looked for the source document and couldn’t find it. But this survey indicated that 39 percent of developers were either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. 36 percent were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied, and 19 percent didn’t go either way, they’re in the middle. So with 39 percent of all your developers dissatisfied, how is that acceptable and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTKhn0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with the document you’re referencing, and so it’s hard to comment on certain specifics. But keep in mind that on a weekly basis, we’re rejecting 40 percent [of apps sent for review], so there’s definitely some friction in the system. But this friction is what produces a curated experience for users, that they love and they can go somewhere and be assured that it’s safe and trusted. So sometimes the developer and the user, their interests don’t intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzMT1n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But it doesn’t seem to me that you feel under pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act to address the concerns of the developers — again, if these numbers are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nVeW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I would look at it in a different way. We turn the place upside down for developers. Look at a complaint that I might get, and look at the amount of time for a change to be made in the company. It’s amazing, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdJOFy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve seen a number of profit and loss statements, and again you see the 100 binders behind me — I don’t recall seeing any other surveys or any other business records showing that you routinely conduct surveys regarding developer satisfaction and that you in fact move or make changes. I take with a grain of salt each side’s anecdotal evidence. What I’m looking for are aggregates. Do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BvpYW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know if we do that. That would be something that Phil [Schiller] would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4r3fT1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You certainly as the CEO then don’t receive regular reports on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoQmq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkM4yM"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
