    <title>Kensington’s $399 StudioDock won’t fit the new, slightly thicker 12.9-inch iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1t1l2OADILkzW4pksRMRx4_UTk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321578/DSCF7579.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmzK2w"&gt;Kensington’s StudioDock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"&gt;high-end $399.99 desktop hub for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; that was released earlier this year, isn’t compatible with the new 12.9-inch model hitting stores today. A representative for Kensington confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2018 and 2020 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ezaBH"&gt;The StudioDock uses a rotatable magnetic mounting plate to secure the iPad when it’s plugged in over USB-C, expanding its connectivity with extra USB-A, ethernet, and HDMI ports. Although the only difference between the StudioDock versions for the 12.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Pro is the size of that mounting plate, Kensington says it won’t be user-replaceable. Instead, the company plans to release an entirely new SKU to fit the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AUaAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NUKh4H"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro should be unaffected, because its dimensions are the same as last year’s model. The 12.9-inch version, however, is slightly thicker because it uses a new, more advanced display with Mini LED technology. Apple itself has warned that its 2020 Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit” the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro due to this difference in thickness, although we found it worked fine in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhUgUb"&gt;No such luck for the StudioDock — you’ll need to buy a whole new one if you want to upgrade your iPad. This wasn’t entirely unforeseeable, and I warned of the possibility when reviewing the StudioDock in March because new iPad Pro models did seem overdue. But the incompatibility is unfortunate for such an expensive product, especially since it was only just released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees call for company to support Palestinians in internal letter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ju6H8FQCl5fE3uiW5xOJRpENqGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319478/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yclD6"&gt;Apple employees are circulating an internal letter calling on Tim Cook to put out a statement supporting the Palestinian people. Nearly 1,000 workers have signed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orkeeG"&gt;The writers, who are part of the Apple Muslim Association, specifically ask the company to recognize that “millions of Palestinian people currently suffer under an illegal occupation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mzm6X"&gt;The move comes on the heels of Israel’s deadly bombing campaign in Gaza, which has killed roughly 227 people, including at least 63 children. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/israel-unleashes-strikes-after-vowing-to-press-on-in-gaza?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the Israeli government approved a unilateral cease fire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqD2tg"&gt;Members of the Apple Muslim Association — an official employee group — say they were inspired to write the note after the company failed to put out a statement condemning the violence toward Palestinians. “We are frustrated and disappointed because once more, many of those in positions of power and influence ... either choose to remain silent or release ineffectually neutral ‘both sides’ statements with regards to the Palestinian situation,’” they wrote. Historically, the company has not been quick to voice solidarity with Muslim employees or support Muslim causes, according to one current worker. (Tim Cook was, however, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump’s Muslim ban). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkmQv0"&gt;The letter was sent Monday. Apple has not yet responded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnm7IX"&gt;Discussions about the violence internally were dominated by pro-Zionist voices, sources said, with Muslim employees and allies trying unsuccessfully to turn the talks toward the plight of Palestinians and Muslim Apple workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="walB4z"&gt;The news comes two days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;a group of Jewish employees at Google&lt;/a&gt; put out a statement calling for the company to protect anti-Zionist speech. Google workers also asked that the company review its business contracts to ensure they do not enable Israeli violations of Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hkAq"&gt;On May 12th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published another internal letter&lt;/a&gt; from Apple employees, calling for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — author of the controversial book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly after publication, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuu0ic"&gt;Here is the text of the full letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uh6DGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10510681"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oqiKra"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s $99 SoundForm Connect Audio lets you add AirPlay 2 to any speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NCSi6XkHZY0XcSiYI0V-uSlEgIc=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319426/SoundForm_Connect.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tcile3"&gt;Belkin’s new SoundForm Connect Audio is a $99 dongle that lets you turn any pair of speakers with either a 3.5mm or optical port into an AirPlay 2-compatible setup. In other words, it’s effectively an Apple version of the (now-defunct) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9412755/google-chromecast-audio-announced-price-release-date"&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8epYR"&gt;As someone who actually likes AirPlay 2, it’s a very interesting concept, especially if you have older speakers or an audio setup that you’d like to get wired into the rest of an AirPlay system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkMrZm"&gt;Setup is simple: just plug in the SoundForm Connect Audio to power (over USB-C, thankfully), and then plug in a 3.5mm headphone jack or optical cable from your speaker system’s input port. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72RwgbepqBRSJrJ4u6w8U-eCTeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529134/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu0wFg"&gt;Unfortunately, the SoundForm Connect Audio does come with a pretty hefty price tag for what it does. The Chromecast Audio used to cost $35, which made it a pretty nice option for hooking up an old speaker to your multiroom audio setup. An Echo Dot (which is also a full-fledged smart speaker) can be hooked up to anything with a headphone jack to use with Alexa and costs $40 to $50 — not counting Amazon’s frequent sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XdsgH"&gt;But the SoundForm Connect Audio costs $99 just to add a speaker to an AirPlay 2 setup. That’s between two to three times as much, or as much as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-00357561%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea’s entry-level Symfonisk&lt;/a&gt; bookshelf speaker (which also offers AirPlay 2 support). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3WLl"&gt;Still, given that there hasn’t really been a solution for this kind of setup since Apple discontinued the AirPort Express (which offered similar functionality for the original AirPlay standard), the SoundForm Connect Audio is better than nothing. But the relatively high price means it’ll likely only be useful for owners of more expensive speaker setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0yGhD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fadapters%2Faudio-video%2Fsoundform-connect-audio-adapter-with-airplay-2%2Fp%2Fp-auz002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundForm Connect Audio&lt;/a&gt; is available to preorder now from Belkin’s website, with orders shipping later in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new privacy ad imagines Thanos-snapping your stalkers out of existence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRQCgvfwt6mkNNe6ISXkydwj5Ak=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319196/vlcsnap_2021_05_20_12h43m26s445.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xs6JLW"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; feature in iOS 14.5 doesn’t seem to be a difficult concept to grasp; initial estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;as many as 96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are leaping at the chance to tell their apps, “No, you can’t track me across the internet.” Now, Apple is taking a victory lap with a full ad campaign, too, one that turns the feature into a selling point for the iPhone and furthers the attempt to pitch itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;as the only tech company you can trust&lt;/a&gt;. And, if you ask me, its new ad spot “Tracked” is just about perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jjBXj"&gt;Just give it a watch above. Who wouldn’t want to Thanos-snap ad trackers into dust? It’s no wonder Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;thinking long and hard about following Apple’s lead&lt;/a&gt; with an anti-tracking feature of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1qIbzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"},{"title":"Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Can Apple live up to Apple’s privacy ads?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/22/21076245/apple-icloud-backup-encryption-loophole-privacy-ads-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dmdztJ"&gt;Critics claim these moves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;will make the internet more expensive&lt;/a&gt; and potentially harm small businesses, and they are updating their apps to warn you about that — as well as the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436944/twitter-ad-tracking-ios-14-5-app-transparency"&gt;that ads might be less relevant&lt;/a&gt; if you opt out. But that’s a tough sell compared to the privacy fears that exist these days, and it’s hard to argue with Apple’s idea that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;users should get to choose for themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The company also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXl5OL"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its own ad platform and apps don’t track users and that the App Tracking Transparency prompt applies to its own apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8dqqJR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ihw_Al4RNno?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>MagSafe PopSockets are here: we tested to see if they stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqlNFFCpe7-xJ9TASP5mQEOavfE=/13x0:4887x3249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319172/DSCF2173.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is bulkier than the regular PopGrips, but is easy to take off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxHvXB"&gt;MagSafe PopSockets are finally here, after the famous phone handle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225701/popsockets-magsafe-accessory"&gt;announced  they would be coming in January&lt;/a&gt;. The PopGrip for MagSafe sells for $30, which is two to three times more expensive than the adhesive versions, but the bigger question that people have been asking since the announcement is whether they’ll be as trustworthy. I decided it was time to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NcqiV"&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is a retractable grip for your phone (as the name implies) that can also work as a stand for watching video or a hands-free video call. PopSockets has made versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopGrip-Swappable-Phones-Tablets/dp/B07P29XQR4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt; for years now (and if you’ve got a collection of fun design tops, this will still work with those), but they’ve traditionally used an adhesive to attach to your device. The MagSafe version uses Apple’s system of magnets that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;it introduced on the iPhone 12 models&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with everything from the iPhone 12 Mini to the gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6swZQw"&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/METISINNO-MagSafe-Socket-Compatible-iPhone/dp/B08RDBZH6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some attempts by third parties&lt;/a&gt; to make MagSafe mounts that you can stick to your iPhone, then stick a PopSocket to, but the PopGrip for MagSafe is an integrated, first-party version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vb2ojW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UrbXV"&gt;PopSockets makes it clear on the box that this shouldn’t be used with bare iPhones, and it’s easy to see why: the iPhone’s glass back doesn’t provide a lot of grip. But sometimes the question with accessories isn’t “what do the directions say” but “can I get away with using it like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obBI70G9XJXgJXiM6dfR0iUhAXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528842/raw_phone_couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYY5rb"&gt;Looks like the answer is no! Listen to PopSockets, and do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use this thing with a bare phone. If you put it on and shake it around a few times you may get lucky and think that it’s fine, but I promise it will come off very easily at some point. Probably while you’re on some sort of perilous precipice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NaThJHHHBX8_5IWRvlmlZTpFHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528854/DSCF2160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a terrible idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yks3rD"&gt;That did make me wonder, though, what would happen if I had a plastic case that wasn’t MagSafe compatible. Would the magnets still reach through, and would the plastic be less slippery than the iPhone’s glass? I can’t answer the second question, because the answer to the first one is absolutely not. It basically just falls off, even with a reasonably thin MagSafe-less case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ct2pov0pujZLr7ES3PnUTOHAiSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528889/Non_Magcase.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIc9Z"&gt;Okay, well let’s give the PopSocket the best-case scenario: how well will it stick to Apple’s silicone MagSafe case, which has both magnets and a reasonably grippy texture?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lgZc9xYyZ9T5MwzGn4UqB0oDUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528870/Silicone_Case_Couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d call that a pass!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="47Zj35"&gt;As you can see, it’s not coming off — at least not until you want to pop it of to, say, wirelessly charge, in which case it’s actually very easy to remove. But maybe it’s just the specific way I was shaking it that let it perform so well. I will admit that I haven’t historically been a heavy PopSocket user, but I’ve been told that people put a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of faith in the PopSocket adhesive. So that made me wonder what was the silliest thing I could do to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; put the MagSafe case / PopGrip connection to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW5Siz"&gt;And obviously the answer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJchhTeDZhM"&gt;was karate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K33n3i4e3YpvbTKRvU-DWpYQZeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528824/karate_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike my form after years of not practicing, my phone is still intact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAYRD"&gt;Make no mistake, if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dislodge the PopSocket from the phone, you can. If I’m holding the phone at a perfect parallel angle to the floor and shaking with all my might, it will eventually come off, but that doesn’t seem like a terribly realistic scenario and it’s been rock-solid in all my other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut0Jkv"&gt;It’s also worth noting that I wasn’t able to test the MagSafe PopSocket with other case materials, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Leather-Case-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5NRTFJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s leather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Clear-Case-iPhone-Pro/dp/B08L5NRTRR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear plastic cases&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s hard to say if it would do as well. But it does seem that, with at least one of Apple’s cases, the MagSafe PopSocket can hang with the adhesive version. And if you use your phone with a non-MagSafe case, or no case at all? Well, you may have to stick with the sticky PopSockets, or buy a MagSafe case if you really want that sweet magnetic removability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BO7UM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEGhukoMXQ3jbIcj5hR2SZQrAt8=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316368/1232992744.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="itNUqx"&gt;Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi had a tricky task in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;explaining why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z65mDK"&gt;Mac computers have an official Apple App Store, but they also allow downloading software from the internet or a third-party store. Apple has never opened up iOS this way, but it’s long touted the privacy and security of both platforms. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;Epic Games sued Apple&lt;/a&gt; to force its hand, saying that if an open model is good enough for macOS, Apple’s claims about iOS ring hollow. On the stand yesterday, Federighi tried to resolve this problem by portraying iPhones and Macs as dramatically different devices — and in the process, threw macOS under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K95LbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iPhones are very attractive targets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hokj"&gt;Federighi outlined three main differences between iOS and macOS. The first is scale. Far more people use iPhones than Macs, and the more users a platform gets, the more enticing that audience becomes to malware developers. Federighi argued iOS users are also much more casual about downloading software, giving attackers better odds of luring them into a download. “iOS users are just accustomed to getting apps all the time,” he said, citing Apple’s old catchphrase: “There’s an app for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0TgRc"&gt;The second difference is data sensitivity. “iPhones are very attractive targets. They are very personal devices that are with you all the time. They have some of your most personal information — of course your contacts, your photos, but also other things,” he said. Mobile devices put a camera, microphone, and GPS tracker in your pocket. “All of these things make access or control of these devices potentially incredibly valuable to an attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnZXcz"&gt;That may undersell private interactions with Macs; Epic’s counsel Yonatan Even noted that many telemedicine calls and other virtual interactions happen on desktop. Still, it’s fair to say phones have become many people’s all-purpose digital lockboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaO4St"&gt;The third difference is more conceptual. Federighi basically says iOS users need to be more protected because the Mac is a specialist tool for people who know how to navigate the complexities of a powerful system, while the iPhone and iPad are — literally — for babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psg99x"&gt;As Federighi put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ttwNKA"&gt;The Mac from the beginning has been part of a generation of systems where the expectation is you can get software from wherever — you can hand it to your friend on a floppy disk and run it, that’s part of the expectation. But Mac users also expect a degree of flexibility that is useful to what they do. Some of them are software developers, some of them are pros running their unique tools, and having that power is part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUhnG6"&gt;I think of it is as if the Mac is a car — that you can take it off-road if you want, you can drive wherever you want. And that comes with as a driver, you gotta be trained, there’s a certain level of responsibility in doing that, but that’s what you wanted to buy. You wanted to buy a car. With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — can operate an iOS device, and be safe in doing so. So it’s a really different product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDAns"&gt;Federighi expanded on the metaphor a little later, when Apple’s counsel asked if macOS was “safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PwNnbL"&gt;Safe if operated correctly, much like that car. If you know how to operate a car, and you obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes. If you’re not — I’ve had a couple of family members who’ve gotten some malware on their Mac. But ultimately, I think the Mac can be operated safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VTp5"&gt;I find the mental image of slowly, cautiously “driving” a Mac around the internet hilarious, because cars are deadly two-ton metal boxes that crush obstacles at superhuman speeds, while my MacBook starts losing keys if I type on it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRkbD"&gt;If you pair these comments with some earlier statements about macOS, though, it’s a bit less funny. Federighi was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;bluntly critical&lt;/a&gt; of macOS security, saying Apple saw “a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable.” If you used the Mac’s security model on the iPhone, “with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said. “iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today.” It’s a distinctly negative evaluation of open computing systems, implying only&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a relatively small platform could afford that openness without disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzU8Lt"&gt;Federighi took a far broader view of security than Epic’s own expert witness James Mickens. Mickens testified earlier that iOS wasn’t meaningfully more secure than Android, but he analyzed mostly technical threats to the platforms. Federighi focused on scams, phishing, and other apps that target human psychology instead of computer code — many of which pose serious dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIJu8"&gt;Sometimes, though, the protectiveness felt patronizing. When Federighi explained Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming, he focused partly on tangible security issues, like how to grant device permissions for different titles on a single gaming app. But he slipped seamlessly into discussing how the concept would be simply too confusing — that iPhone and iPad owners would be befuddled by the notion of launching a separate game catalog. Apple wants iOS devices to feel trustworthy, but at times like that, it seems more like Apple just doesn’t trust its own users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zagg’s new iPad cases are affordable alternatives to the Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zs1gbbziPIX9enVihJVvr94SiW8=/125x0:875x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315396/zagg_ipad_pro_keys_with_trackpad_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DmLdno"&gt;Zagg has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2Fkeyboards%3Fcj_aid%3D12670080%26cj_pid%3D9173227%26cj_sid%3D%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww%26cjevent%3De4ff189fb8f911eb80f200050a1c0e13&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22444822%2Fzagg-pro-keys-trackpad-keyboard-case-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new selection of iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt;: the Pro Keys with Trackpad, a case with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard; the laptop-style Rugged Book with an adjustable magnetic hinge; and the trackpad-less Pro Keys case (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/19/zagg-pro-keys-ipad-trackpad-case/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50rNSG"&gt;The accessories support several of Apple’s newest iPads, from the M1-enabled iPad Pro on the high-end to the entry level 10.2-inch iPad. Good alternative keyboard cases to Apple’s trackpad-equipped Magic Keyboard are mostly limited to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Mix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, so Zagg’s version is more than welcome, if a bit less sleek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6nqDP"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro Keys with Trackpad has a case that wraps around your entire iPad and a detachable backlit Bluetooth keyboard that also doubles as an adjustable stand when magnetically attached. Along with the trackpad, which can be independently turned off to save battery, the case also includes a built-in protective cover for the Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjpBf1"&gt;Based off Zagg’s photos, it seems pretty thick, but the keyboard case is almost half the price of the Magic Keyboard. The Pro Keys with Trackpad costs $149.99 for 11-inch iPad Pros and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the less powerful 10.2-inch iPad, it costs $139.99. There’s no version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHQI5OeLB3VWqxC-L7Zy-JhLxCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527010/pk_trackpad_detachable_tile.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys with Trackpad case has a detachable keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="41bH6b"&gt;Zagg’s new Rugged Book is much closer to Brydge’s laptop-style keyboard cases. It’s thick, though in this case intentionally, and Zagg claims it has 6.6 feet of drop protection. The keyboard is still a backlit Bluetooth keyboard, but attaches via an adjustable magnetic hinge that should offer more viewing angles. It’s trackpad-free in this case, but the same price as the Pro Keys with Trackpad. The Rugged Book costs $149.99 and works with both the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hU0Rtj3oF1EOmZbAE1HUIwUIqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527012/01_hero_33_3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Rugged Book has better drop protection, but lacks a trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNcc0"&gt;Finally, there’s the Pro Keys case, which is the most stripped down and straightforward of the bunch. Like its name suggests, it shares a lot of similarities in design to the Pro Keys with Trackpad, just without the trackpad. Like Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio cases, the Pro Keys case offers two main viewing angles, but since it’s technically an iPad case and a keyboard cover, you can theoretically stay protected without the keyboard attached. The Pro Keys case costs $109.99 for the 11-inch iPad Pro models and 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the 2018 to 2021 12.9-inch iPad, the Pro Keys case costs $169.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHENkC-F5i9AUce2RpWkkjH_dlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527016/01_hero_33_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys lacks a trackpad, but is also less expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Apple announces a slew of accessibility updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person’s wrist showing an Apple Watch. On the screen of the Watch is an option to end a run, highlighted with a small cursor hovering over it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWKaurK8b9bqtr9jfqXcQwibWgI=/100x0:880x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312971/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_2.42.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch with the Assistive Touch cursor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3hyNc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a variety of new and updated features for people with disabilities today. Beginning May 20th, customers can use the new SignTime sign language interpreter service to contact AppleCare and retail customer care through their web browsers. Software updates later this year to iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS will bring improved options for Assistive Touch, VoiceOver, hearing aid support, and background sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inBvEa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe everyone should have the tools they need to change the world. Accessibility is a fundamental right, and we’re always pushing the boundaries of innovation so that everyone can learn, create and connect in new ways. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GAAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x"&gt;https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1395074896791674885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzzyD6"&gt;The new SignTime service is launching first in the US, UK, and France, and offers remote interpreter access for American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. People can also use the service in Apple stores to get interpretation without booking it in advance, potentially preventing the hassle of wrangling an interpreter on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GElgH8"&gt;People with limb differences will be able to use Assistive Touch on watchOS, which should enable them to use Apple Watch without touching the screen. (Apple did not verify which Watches this will work for.) Apple says the Apple Watch can detect muscle movement and tendon activity through its built-in sensors, allowing users to control a cursor on the watch screen, answer calls, access notifications, and more by making various movements and gestures. (You can see it in action in the video &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg8fFG"&gt;iPadOS will support third-party eye-tracking devices, allowing people with low mobility to move a cursor with their gaze and perform actions by holding eye contact, rather than tapping the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGGMmo"&gt;VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, will be updated to include more details in images. According to Apple, it will allow people to navigate images with text and data tables by rows and columns, and describe people and objects in images. People will also be able to add image descriptions with Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OSdE9"&gt;Apple plans to upgrade the Made for iPhone hearing devices program, too, with support for bidirectional hearing aids. Users will also be able to upload their hearing test results to Headphone Accommodations to more easily customize how the feature amplifies sounds and adjusts different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three smiling Memojis, showing one with a cochlear implant on the left, one with nasal oxygen tubes in the center, and one with a soft helmet on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xafYxYSX8o60kVdNupxHnTZbpls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526096/apple_gaad21_new_memoji_05192021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/e1e4026d-01e3-40da-bea5-aee0f1e19a09" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UCeQKs"&gt;For neurodiverse people (or anyone who likes white noise), Apple is introducing Background Sounds that can be incorporated with other audio and system sounds. They include “balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds” that can be set to play continuously and mask distracting or overwhelming noises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emW7wY"&gt;Other features Apple is planning for later in the year include the ability to use mouth sounds like clicks or pops instead of using physical buttons, the customization of display and text size settings in individual apps, and new Memoji options with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKugC"&gt;Companies large and small always have room for improvement when it comes to making their products accessible, but Apple has generally been a leader in the space. These updates hopefully signal a continued commitment to designing with disabled people in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDofnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qKNPY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The level of Mac malware is not acceptable, says Apple’s Craig Federighi at Epic trial</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjuVel"&gt;The antitrust case between Apple and Epic continued today, and it brought Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, to the stand. Federighi’s mission was pretty clear from the outset: to extol the security benefits that come with iOS’s walled-off ecosystem and warn of the dangers that would come with breaking the App Store model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTIwUX"&gt;But in building that argument, Federighi also made some surprisingly blunt concessions about security on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGp6j"&gt;“If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said in the testimony. “And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XqAfB"&gt;Federighi made the claim as part of a broader argument for why iOS could not adopt the same software model as macOS, which allows for alternate software sources like the Epic Games Store. But in making the case for iOS security, the software chief ended up painting a bleak picture of security on the desktop platform. The full exchange is presented in context below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncbts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; There are multiple stores on the Mac. So, if that can happen on the Mac, why should we not allow the same stores to exist on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2e1B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Federighi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s certainly how we’ve done it on the Mac and it’s regularly exploited on the Mac. iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today. And that’s despite the fact that Mac users inherently download less software and are subject to a way less economically motivated attacker base. If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac. And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS. Put that same situation in place for iOS and it would be a very bad situation for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g1xvsS"&gt;Federighi also cast the difference between the two platforms in unusual terms, describing the desktop platform as something akin to a car. “If operated correctly, much like that car, if you know how to operate a car and obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes,” he said when asked directly whether macOS is safe. “If not, I’ve had a couple of family members who have gotten some malware on their Macs.” macOS allows software to be downloaded and installed from the web, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-your-mac-from-malware-mh40596/mac"&gt;Apple advises customers&lt;/a&gt; that restricting this functionality to the App Store is “the most secure setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiPm6h"&gt;In contrast, Federighi presented iOS as a child-safe version of the less restricted macOS. “With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — are able to operate an iOS device and be safe in doing so. It’s really a different product,” Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriuCU"&gt;Federighi’s testimony comes in the final days of the trial, with much of the remaining time devoted to testimony from Apple executives. CEO Tim Cook is expected to take the stand on Friday, with closing statements from both sides given on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple asks court to rule iOS is not an ‘essential facility’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cfvrvd"&gt;After two and a half weeks in court, Apple is taking aim at one of the central elements of Epic’s antitrust case. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20761616-apple-motion-to-dismiss-essential-facility-claim"&gt;In a filing Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt;, Apple asked the court to dismiss one of the 10 counts alleged in the initial complaint, arguing Epic had failed to establish any evidence for the charge that Apple had violated the essential facilities doctrine by failing to provide access to software distribution tools on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cptEsS"&gt;“At trial, Epic adduced no proof in support of this claim,” Apple’s filing reads. “On the contrary, Epic’s principal expert expressly disclaimed any opinion on essential facility, and (in response to a direct question from the Court) rejected the notion that iOS should be treated as a public utility. The Court should enter judgment for Apple on this claim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ccReMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform,’” says the judge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A1oReY"&gt;Filed as a motion for partial findings, Apple is pushing to split off the essential facilities charge from the other nine charges made in Epic’s initial complaint. In essence, Apple believes it can win a quick victory on this specific point. That won’t settle the case entirely since the other nine charges still require a ruling, but it would be an unexpected and embarrassing loss for Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6KoVn"&gt;Epic hasn’t talked about the essential facilities doctrine much in court, and Apple’s lawyers are responding in part to vocal skepticism from the court. On May 12th, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers specifically confronted Epic about the weakness of its evidence for the charge. “I’ve heard quite a bit of evidence throughout the trial regarding how big Apple is and how anticompetitive it is,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1392558985643970564"&gt;Gonzalez Rogers said&lt;/a&gt;. “It sounds to me like what Epic is saying is ‘We want Apple to allow us to deal on their platform. And there are only two of these platforms, and because there are only two platforms, all these competitors can’t succeed without access to these platforms.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdqrB"&gt;Epic’s counsel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392558958972391424"&gt;clarified that&lt;/a&gt; it had “not abandoned that theory” — but it hasn’t substantially raised it in the days since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8WYHR1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” argues Epic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7qpA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_facilities_doctrine"&gt;The essential facilities doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is a long-standing element of antitrust law that prevents dominant firms from using bottleneck services to box out competitors. &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/224/383/"&gt;In a foundational example from 1912&lt;/a&gt;, a railroad consortium prevented competitors from offering passage to and from St. Louis by denying access to switching yards around the city. The Supreme Court ruled that the arrangement was an illegal restraint of trade, establishing that companies must provide reasonable use of facilities that are essential for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnUoX"&gt;In its complaint, Epic argues that app distribution on iOS is the same kind of bottleneck, charging that Apple has used its control over the iOS platform to prevent Epic and other competitors from offering competing app stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQU0Z"&gt;“Apple controls iOS, which is essential to effective competition in the iOS App Distribution Market,” the complaint argues. “Through its denial of its essential facility, Apple maintains its monopoly power in the iOS App Distribution Market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKEwJA"&gt;But Apple is now countering that Epic has reasonable access to iOS through the App Store itself — and that iOS customers are plainly not essential to the operation of its business since the company has been broadly successful without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QIGvj"&gt;“Epic’s own experience, as established by the trial evidence, confirms that there is nothing ‘essential’ about iOS,” Apple’s filing reads. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was a success before it was made available on the App Store, and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s revenues from iOS (prior to its removal) accounted for just 7 percent of its total revenue. And native apps are not the only way Epic can reach iOS customers—it also is free to distribute its products (including by selling V-Bucks) to iOS customers over the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbx0cb"&gt;Apple’s motion asks for a hearing on the issue on Monday, May 24th — or “as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court.”&lt;/p&gt;
