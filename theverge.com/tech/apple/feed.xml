    <title>The new Apple TV 4K lets you play any TV audio through a HomePod</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnB1aCr1PINh7qb269C4LjovO0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324126/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIl6l"&gt;Apple might have discontinued the original, full-size HomePod smart speaker, but the company is continuing to add new functionality to it. The latest one relies on you also buying the new, second-generation Apple TV 4K, however. If you own both products, there’s now built-in support for HDMI ARC and eARC, which lets the HomePod play audio from other devices plugged into your TV — not just an Apple TV streaming box. Gaming consoles should work; same goes for Blu-ray players or even another streaming gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv22Xu"&gt;The feature can be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/play-audio-from-tv-inputs-homepod-apple-tv/"&gt;enabled in the “video and audio” area&lt;/a&gt; of the Apple TV settings menu. There you’ll see a field labeled “Audio Return Channel (beta),” where you can tell the Apple TV to route all television audio through HomePod speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNZn0V"&gt;I haven’t tested this yet, so I can’t speak to any latency issues that could negate its appeal for gaming, but it’s nice to see the HomePod gaining new tricks even after Apple has officially brought an end to sales of the product. (You can still find them at retailers including Apple itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fWzyc"&gt;This continued evolution of home theater features is also a hint that Apple could have more speakers in the pipeline. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last month that the company is in the early stages of development on a product that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;combines an Apple TV, speaker, and camera&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the $99 HomePod Mini stands as the lone smart speaker that Apple is actively marketing. Unfortunately, that device does not support the new audio return channel feature described above. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify finally adds offline music downloads on Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2297IVf1kkpldXGU3yLjdO48spc=/410x0:1511x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69322747/Apple_Watch_banner_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdo8Sp"&gt;Spotify is adding the ability to download playlists, albums, and podcasts on Apple Watch to play offline, the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-21/enjoy-more-ways-than-ever-to-use-spotify-on-your-apple-watch-now-with-downloads/"&gt;company announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Users will be able to stream audio in 96kbps, add and delete Spotify content on their phones, and sync with the Watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o43TIr"&gt;“Being able to download music and podcasts complements the existing feature of being able to stream your favorites from the watch, and now you don’t even have to take your phone with you,” the company said in its news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OHlogg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/pr-newsroom-wp/1/2021/05/Apple-Watch-2021-Landscape.mp4?_=1" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OpEGi5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549483/spotify-apple-watch-streaming-music-rolling-out"&gt;Spotify added the ability to stream&lt;/a&gt; music using an Apple Watch in November; until that point, the Apple Watch only worked as a remote for Spotify music playing on an iPhone or other Spotify Connect-compatible device. Spotify first launched its Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18063838/spotify-apple-watch-download-features"&gt;app in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaQy18"&gt;The offline feature will be available starting Friday on Apple Watch Series 3 or later running WatchOS 6.0 or later, with WatchOS 7.1 and up recommended. A Spotify Premium subscription is also required. &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/"&gt;Spotify Premium memberships&lt;/a&gt; range from $9.99 per month for a single account, up to $15.99 per month for a family plan. There’s also a $4.99-per-month student account option available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6etuX"&gt;Another streaming music service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer, beat Spotify to the punch&lt;/a&gt;, adding the ability to download music from its Apple Watch app earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQfU4g"&gt;Also this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;Spotify said it was launching a new feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow Google’s Wear devices to download music and listen offline, without needing an accompanying phone. It hasn’t been released yet, but it’s in the works, the company’s product lead for wearables said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/D_mVOAXcrtc?t=2515"&gt;during Google’s developer keynote&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzPyXQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple TV Siri Remote review: pushing all the right buttons</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got an Apple TV, it’s a must-have upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L7aLVB"&gt;It’s so, so, so much better. But the moment Apple showed off the second-generation Siri Remote, it was obvious that this would be a huge improvement over its detested predecessor. It’s easy to tell which way is right side up when you reach for it. The clickable touchpad area that dominated the upper third of the prior remote has been replaced by a more intuitive D-pad. The Siri button has been pushed to the remote’s right side, almost guaranteeing that you’ll never unintentionally trigger Apple’s voice assistant. And now there’s a proper power button for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFcXYL"&gt;Listing all of these “upgrades” on the new $59 Siri Remote really illustrates just how disappointing the old one that somehow lasted six years on the market was. Before this big redesign, the most Apple did in that time was to try to cure the “which side is up?” confusion by adding a white rim around one of the buttons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442395/at-the-epic-trial-phil-schiller-got-away-clean"&gt;“Can’t innovate anymore, my ass.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFTwoI"&gt;But this? This new Siri Remote is a very good remote. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it’s functional, accessible, and painless to use. If you used those words to describe the original Siri Remote, you’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;in the minority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="domTV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10511307"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OCQTI2"&gt;It feels really nice, too. Apple makes the remote from a unibody aluminum shell that’s taller, heavier, and considerably thicker than the old Siri clicker. It’s slightly narrower than the black remote but still feels larger on the whole — and that’s a positive. The previous Siri remote was so thin that it was easily lost to the deepest reaches of the couch. I don’t see that being as much of a problem with the new, chunkier hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J20Dix"&gt;The Siri Remote is in keeping with Apple’s renewed fondness for hard edges. With the remote gripped in hand, you never really feel the edges on the front, but you do at the back. The back metal is curved, but there’s still a hard edge at both sides. As long as you don’t squeeze the remote too tight, it should prove reasonably comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GEEcVIBgXK-1bw4weScVml5NO6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529635/DSCF3939.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has added power and mute buttons to the new Siri Remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xda5D"&gt;Instead of putting what basically amounted to a trackpad on the top section of the remote, Apple has switched to a much more traditional directional pad. Within that circular D-pad is a touch-sensitive center button that still lets you swipe around content or move in any direction just like you could before. (And yes, you can still play with the subtle movement of app icons on the home screen by gently nudging your thumb around.) But some streaming apps didn’t work perfectly with that input method, so Apple is now including the far more precise D-pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttHtGW"&gt;This choose-your-preferred-navigation method — Apple calls it the “clickpad with touch surface” — has a very short learning curve. Initially, I would inadvertently activate the touchpad when I just meant to move my finger from down to up or vice versa on the D-pad. That didn’t last long, but if it winds up a bigger hassle for you, there’s an option in the remote’s settings menu to assign the center button to “click only,” which gives the D-pad all navigation duties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa8uyQ"&gt;Apple has also come up with a clever jogwheel function that lets you circle a finger around the outer ring to scrub through videos at faster or slower speeds depending on how quickly you’re thumbing around the circle. It’s a direct callback to the days of the iPod clickwheel and does a great job helping you land on an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; moment in a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGfqfNUpkQIqqzKnv6M2f13zTSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529636/DSCF3948_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new clickpad is infinitely better than the prior touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aa0he1F9Qr__5W97w2f4nWIT680=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529710/DSCF3949.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Siri button is now on the side, where you’re less likely to press it accidentally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="12zYjz"&gt;But I must confess something: I had an embarrassing few hours where I couldn’t figure out how to make this work. Eventually, I learned the trick: after pausing a video, you’ve got to rest your finger on the D-pad momentarily before you start circling around it. An animation will pop up in the progress bar (with a little dot that indicates where your finger is) to let you know you’re in jogwheel mode. If you just pause the video and immediately start the circular movement, it doesn’t do the right thing. Don’t be like me and unnecessarily factory reset your Apple TV 4K because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xct7Jj"&gt;The buttons themselves all have a satisfying click and don’t feel the least bit mushy. The clickpad is quieter when pressed than the buttons below it, which are each significantly noisier than any other remotes I had to compare against, be it for a Roku, Chromecast, or otherwise. Again, it’s not a problem unless you’re sensitive to that sort of thing, but you’ll absolutely hear the volume rocker when you’re turning up a certain scene in a movie or show. The Siri button on the side is whisper quiet; you still have to press and hold it down whenever you’re doing a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM0hLg"&gt;You might also have to overcome some muscle memory challenges since the mute button is now where play / pause was situated on the old remote. The “menu” button has been rebadged as “back” but does the same functions as before, which means, in most cases, the new icon makes a ton more sense. The buttons aren’t backlit, but it’s easy enough to memorize them by feel once you’ve used the remote for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBdcQqhgCwpu8-dCcM6PyV6lQFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529631/DSCF3906_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a circular D-pad with a touchpad in the center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EVCHZA"&gt;But as good as the new Siri Remote is, it feels like Apple missed some opportunities that frankly seem like low-hanging fruit. The most glaring is that there’s no way to locate the remote if you’re unable to find it. As I said earlier, the bigger dimensions should make for fewer instances where the remote gets misplaced, but &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way of having it alert you to its location would’ve been nice. “Hey Siri, where’s my remote?” seems like such an easy thing to make happen, but that voice query won’t do you any good or make the remote beep. And unlike Apple’s recently introduced AirTags, there’s no ultra-wideband chip in the remote to help pinpoint its position in a room. If you’re finding that the remote goes MIA constantly, you might just have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;settle for a case&lt;/a&gt; that combines an AirTag with the Siri Remote. But having a simple, straightforward remote locator feature is one area where Roku objectively beats out Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWIcIl"&gt;A less impactful gripe is the lack of an input button for switching between HDMI sources; the Apple TV automatically becomes the active input when you power it on or wake it from sleep. But an input button would’ve at least made life easier for people switching between an Apple TV and an Xbox or PlayStation. As a result, I just can’t quit my LG TV’s remote, much as I wish I could. Most of my devices automatically grab the TV’s attention when they’re switched on, but a button is foolproof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Siri Remote is substantially thicker than the previous one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91i2a-8hNAVdxgdT5m38ROEYGso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529633/DSCF3923.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully it won’t go swimming in couch cushions as often.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13pTzo"&gt;I can complain about buttons being absent, but I can also praise Apple for the same reason: there are no branded shortcut buttons whatsoever on the Siri Remote. Not even Netflix can lock down its own button, whereas you’d be hard-pressed to find another streaming box remote without that logo somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="EcTqGE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10511751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="88lBKt"&gt;The Siri Remote still charges with Apple’s Lightning connector — despite now being thick enough to house a USB-C jack. USB seems more natural for this type of scenario, but what do I know? I’m just one man who’s elated to have a reliable, sensibly designed remote control again. Apple is going to keep doing Apple things. I was not able to test the new remote with third-party charging stands designed for the old one, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that industry catches up with the new design in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AvEaeLXu1kCNhxDZlwfv3vN_huE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529638/DSCF3951.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right choice is clear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y4avp2"&gt;The gyroscope and accelerometer from the previous Siri Remote are history, so you won’t be able to use this one for Apple Arcade games that rely on those sensors. But it’s unlikely many people were gaming with it to begin with; tvOS now supports many third-party gamepads, including the latest Xbox and PlayStation controllers, if you hadn’t heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4IiJSM"&gt;Any way you slice it, the new Siri Remote is a win on every level. It’s inconceivable that we put up with the last one for so many years, but its time has come. And the remote control taking its place is extremely good at doing remote control things. Much as how Apple’s M1 MacBooks would have earned perfect scores if they’d had competent webcams, the Siri Remote would be flirting with perfection if it just had some way of letting you easily find the thing. Or if the buttons were backlit. My review of the new Apple TV 4K is coming soon, but if you’ve already got the last model, this is the only real must-have upgrade to go for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s $399 StudioDock won’t fit the new, slightly thicker 12.9-inch iPad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1t1l2OADILkzW4pksRMRx4_UTk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69321578/DSCF7579.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmzK2w"&gt;Kensington’s StudioDock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"&gt;high-end $399.99 desktop hub for the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; that was released earlier this year, isn’t compatible with the new 12.9-inch model hitting stores today. A representative for Kensington confirmed the news to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying it’s because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2018 and 2020 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ezaBH"&gt;The StudioDock uses a rotatable magnetic mounting plate to secure the iPad when it’s plugged in over USB-C, expanding its connectivity with extra USB-A, ethernet, and HDMI ports. Although the only difference between the StudioDock versions for the 12.9-inch and 11-inch iPad Pro is the size of that mounting plate, Kensington says it won’t be user-replaceable. Instead, the company plans to release an entirely new SKU to fit the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AUaAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22333551/kensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NUKh4H"&gt;The new 11-inch iPad Pro should be unaffected, because its dimensions are the same as last year’s model. The 12.9-inch version, however, is slightly thicker because it uses a new, more advanced display with Mini LED technology. Apple itself has warned that its 2020 Magic Keyboard “may not precisely fit” the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro due to this difference in thickness, although we found it worked fine in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhUgUb"&gt;No such luck for the StudioDock — you’ll need to buy a whole new one if you want to upgrade your iPad. This wasn’t entirely unforeseeable, and I warned of the possibility when reviewing the StudioDock in March because new iPad Pro models did seem overdue. But the incompatibility is unfortunate for such an expensive product, especially since it was only just released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees call for company to support Palestinians in internal letter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ju6H8FQCl5fE3uiW5xOJRpENqGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319478/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yclD6"&gt;Apple employees are circulating an internal letter calling on Tim Cook to put out a statement supporting the Palestinian people. Nearly 1,000 workers have signed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orkeeG"&gt;The writers, who are part of the Apple Muslim Association, specifically ask the company to recognize that “millions of Palestinian people currently suffer under an illegal occupation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mzm6X"&gt;The move comes on the heels of Israel’s deadly bombing campaign in Gaza, which has killed roughly 227 people, including at least 63 children. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/israel-unleashes-strikes-after-vowing-to-press-on-in-gaza?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the Israeli government approved a unilateral cease fire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqD2tg"&gt;Members of the Apple Muslim Association — an official employee group — say they were inspired to write the note after the company failed to put out a statement condemning the violence toward Palestinians. “We are frustrated and disappointed because once more, many of those in positions of power and influence ... either choose to remain silent or release ineffectually neutral ‘both sides’ statements with regards to the Palestinian situation,’” they wrote. Historically, the company has not been quick to voice solidarity with Muslim employees or support Muslim causes, according to one current worker. (Tim Cook was, however, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump’s Muslim ban). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkmQv0"&gt;The letter was sent Monday. Apple has not yet responded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnm7IX"&gt;Discussions about the violence internally were dominated by pro-Zionist voices, sources said, with Muslim employees and allies trying unsuccessfully to turn the talks toward the plight of Palestinians and Muslim Apple workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="walB4z"&gt;The news comes two days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;a group of Jewish employees at Google&lt;/a&gt; put out a statement calling for the company to protect anti-Zionist speech. Google workers also asked that the company review its business contracts to ensure they do not enable Israeli violations of Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hkAq"&gt;On May 12th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published another internal letter&lt;/a&gt; from Apple employees, calling for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — author of the controversial book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly after publication, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuu0ic"&gt;Here is the text of the full letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uh6DGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10510681"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oqiKra"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s $99 SoundForm Connect Audio lets you add AirPlay 2 to any speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NCSi6XkHZY0XcSiYI0V-uSlEgIc=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319426/SoundForm_Connect.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tcile3"&gt;Belkin’s new SoundForm Connect Audio is a $99 dongle that lets you turn any pair of speakers with either a 3.5mm or optical port into an AirPlay 2-compatible setup. In other words, it’s effectively an Apple version of the (now-defunct) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9412755/google-chromecast-audio-announced-price-release-date"&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8epYR"&gt;As someone who actually likes AirPlay 2, it’s a very interesting concept, especially if you have older speakers or an audio setup that you’d like to get wired into the rest of an AirPlay system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkMrZm"&gt;Setup is simple: just plug in the SoundForm Connect Audio to power (over USB-C, thankfully), and then plug in a 3.5mm headphone jack or optical cable from your speaker system’s input port. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72RwgbepqBRSJrJ4u6w8U-eCTeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529134/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu0wFg"&gt;Unfortunately, the SoundForm Connect Audio does come with a pretty hefty price tag for what it does. The Chromecast Audio used to cost $35, which made it a pretty nice option for hooking up an old speaker to your multiroom audio setup. An Echo Dot (which is also a full-fledged smart speaker) can be hooked up to anything with a headphone jack to use with Alexa and costs $40 to $50 — not counting Amazon’s frequent sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XdsgH"&gt;But the SoundForm Connect Audio costs $99 just to add a speaker to an AirPlay 2 setup. That’s between two to three times as much, or as much as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-black-00357561%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea’s entry-level Symfonisk&lt;/a&gt; bookshelf speaker (which also offers AirPlay 2 support). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3WLl"&gt;Still, given that there hasn’t really been a solution for this kind of setup since Apple discontinued the AirPort Express (which offered similar functionality for the original AirPlay standard), the SoundForm Connect Audio is better than nothing. But the relatively high price means it’ll likely only be useful for owners of more expensive speaker setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0yGhD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fadapters%2Faudio-video%2Fsoundform-connect-audio-adapter-with-airplay-2%2Fp%2Fp-auz002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22446088%2Fbelkin-soundform-connect-audio-airplay-2-adapter-dongle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundForm Connect Audio&lt;/a&gt; is available to preorder now from Belkin’s website, with orders shipping later in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new privacy ad imagines Thanos-snapping your stalkers out of existence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRQCgvfwt6mkNNe6ISXkydwj5Ak=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319196/vlcsnap_2021_05_20_12h43m26s445.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xs6JLW"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; feature in iOS 14.5 doesn’t seem to be a difficult concept to grasp; initial estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/"&gt;as many as 96 percent of US users&lt;/a&gt; are leaping at the chance to tell their apps, “No, you can’t track me across the internet.” Now, Apple is taking a victory lap with a full ad campaign, too, one that turns the feature into a selling point for the iPhone and furthers the attempt to pitch itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282158/apple-services-privacy-credit-card-tv-data-sharing"&gt;as the only tech company you can trust&lt;/a&gt;. And, if you ask me, its new ad spot “Tracked” is just about perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jjBXj"&gt;Just give it a watch above. Who wouldn’t want to Thanos-snap ad trackers into dust? It’s no wonder Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;thinking long and hard about following Apple’s lead&lt;/a&gt; with an anti-tracking feature of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1qIbzV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to&amp;amp;nbsp;use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"},{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"},{"title":"Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444471/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-trial-craig-federighi-ios-security"},{"title":"Can Apple live up to Apple’s privacy ads?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/22/21076245/apple-icloud-backup-encryption-loophole-privacy-ads-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dmdztJ"&gt;Critics claim these moves &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;will make the internet more expensive&lt;/a&gt; and potentially harm small businesses, and they are updating their apps to warn you about that — as well as the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436944/twitter-ad-tracking-ios-14-5-app-transparency"&gt;that ads might be less relevant&lt;/a&gt; if you opt out. But that’s a tough sell compared to the privacy fears that exist these days, and it’s hard to argue with Apple’s idea that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;users should get to choose for themselves&lt;/a&gt;. The company also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXl5OL"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its own ad platform and apps don’t track users and that the App Tracking Transparency prompt applies to its own apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8dqqJR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ihw_Al4RNno?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>MagSafe PopSockets are here: we tested to see if they stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqlNFFCpe7-xJ9TASP5mQEOavfE=/13x0:4887x3249/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69319172/DSCF2173.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is bulkier than the regular PopGrips, but is easy to take off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pxHvXB"&gt;MagSafe PopSockets are finally here, after the famous phone handle company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225701/popsockets-magsafe-accessory"&gt;announced  they would be coming in January&lt;/a&gt;. The PopGrip for MagSafe sells for $30, which is two to three times more expensive than the adhesive versions, but the bigger question that people have been asking since the announcement is whether they’ll be as trustworthy. I decided it was time to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NcqiV"&gt;The PopGrip for MagSafe is a retractable grip for your phone (as the name implies) that can also work as a stand for watching video or a hands-free video call. PopSockets has made versions of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopGrip-Swappable-Phones-Tablets/dp/B07P29XQR4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt; for years now (and if you’ve got a collection of fun design tops, this will still work with those), but they’ve traditionally used an adhesive to attach to your device. The MagSafe version uses Apple’s system of magnets that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;it introduced on the iPhone 12 models&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with everything from the iPhone 12 Mini to the gargantuan iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6swZQw"&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/METISINNO-MagSafe-Socket-Compatible-iPhone/dp/B08RDBZH6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some attempts by third parties&lt;/a&gt; to make MagSafe mounts that you can stick to your iPhone, then stick a PopSocket to, but the PopGrip for MagSafe is an integrated, first-party version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vb2ojW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1UrbXV"&gt;PopSockets makes it clear on the box that this shouldn’t be used with bare iPhones, and it’s easy to see why: the iPhone’s glass back doesn’t provide a lot of grip. But sometimes the question with accessories isn’t “what do the directions say” but “can I get away with using it like this?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/obBI70G9XJXgJXiM6dfR0iUhAXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528842/raw_phone_couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYY5rb"&gt;Looks like the answer is no! Listen to PopSockets, and do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use this thing with a bare phone. If you put it on and shake it around a few times you may get lucky and think that it’s fine, but I promise it will come off very easily at some point. Probably while you’re on some sort of perilous precipice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NaThJHHHBX8_5IWRvlmlZTpFHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528854/DSCF2160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictured: a terrible idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yks3rD"&gt;That did make me wonder, though, what would happen if I had a plastic case that wasn’t MagSafe compatible. Would the magnets still reach through, and would the plastic be less slippery than the iPhone’s glass? I can’t answer the second question, because the answer to the first one is absolutely not. It basically just falls off, even with a reasonably thin MagSafe-less case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ct2pov0pujZLr7ES3PnUTOHAiSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528889/Non_Magcase.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIc9Z"&gt;Okay, well let’s give the PopSocket the best-case scenario: how well will it stick to Apple’s silicone MagSafe case, which has both magnets and a reasonably grippy texture?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5lgZc9xYyZ9T5MwzGn4UqB0oDUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528870/Silicone_Case_Couch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d call that a pass!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="47Zj35"&gt;As you can see, it’s not coming off — at least not until you want to pop it of to, say, wirelessly charge, in which case it’s actually very easy to remove. But maybe it’s just the specific way I was shaking it that let it perform so well. I will admit that I haven’t historically been a heavy PopSocket user, but I’ve been told that people put a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of faith in the PopSocket adhesive. So that made me wonder what was the silliest thing I could do to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; put the MagSafe case / PopGrip connection to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wW5Siz"&gt;And obviously the answer &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJchhTeDZhM"&gt;was karate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K33n3i4e3YpvbTKRvU-DWpYQZeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528824/karate_test.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike my form after years of not practicing, my phone is still intact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAYRD"&gt;Make no mistake, if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to dislodge the PopSocket from the phone, you can. If I’m holding the phone at a perfect parallel angle to the floor and shaking with all my might, it will eventually come off, but that doesn’t seem like a terribly realistic scenario and it’s been rock-solid in all my other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut0Jkv"&gt;It’s also worth noting that I wasn’t able to test the MagSafe PopSocket with other case materials, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Leather-Case-MagSafe-iPhone/dp/B08L5NRTFJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s leather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Clear-Case-iPhone-Pro/dp/B08L5NRTRR?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clear plastic cases&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s hard to say if it would do as well. But it does seem that, with at least one of Apple’s cases, the MagSafe PopSocket can hang with the adhesive version. And if you use your phone with a non-MagSafe case, or no case at all? Well, you may have to stick with the sticky PopSockets, or buy a MagSafe case if you really want that sweet magnetic removability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BO7UM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple wants users to trust iOS, but it doesn’t trust iOS users</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEGhukoMXQ3jbIcj5hR2SZQrAt8=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69316368/1232992744.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="itNUqx"&gt;Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi had a tricky task in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;trial&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;explaining why the Mac’s security wasn’t good enough for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z65mDK"&gt;Mac computers have an official Apple App Store, but they also allow downloading software from the internet or a third-party store. Apple has never opened up iOS this way, but it’s long touted the privacy and security of both platforms. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;Epic Games sued Apple&lt;/a&gt; to force its hand, saying that if an open model is good enough for macOS, Apple’s claims about iOS ring hollow. On the stand yesterday, Federighi tried to resolve this problem by portraying iPhones and Macs as dramatically different devices — and in the process, threw macOS under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K95LbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“iPhones are very attractive targets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u7hokj"&gt;Federighi outlined three main differences between iOS and macOS. The first is scale. Far more people use iPhones than Macs, and the more users a platform gets, the more enticing that audience becomes to malware developers. Federighi argued iOS users are also much more casual about downloading software, giving attackers better odds of luring them into a download. “iOS users are just accustomed to getting apps all the time,” he said, citing Apple’s old catchphrase: “There’s an app for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0TgRc"&gt;The second difference is data sensitivity. “iPhones are very attractive targets. They are very personal devices that are with you all the time. They have some of your most personal information — of course your contacts, your photos, but also other things,” he said. Mobile devices put a camera, microphone, and GPS tracker in your pocket. “All of these things make access or control of these devices potentially incredibly valuable to an attacker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnZXcz"&gt;That may undersell private interactions with Macs; Epic’s counsel Yonatan Even noted that many telemedicine calls and other virtual interactions happen on desktop. Still, it’s fair to say phones have become many people’s all-purpose digital lockboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaO4St"&gt;The third difference is more conceptual. Federighi basically says iOS users need to be more protected because the Mac is a specialist tool for people who know how to navigate the complexities of a powerful system, while the iPhone and iPad are — literally — for babies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psg99x"&gt;As Federighi put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ttwNKA"&gt;The Mac from the beginning has been part of a generation of systems where the expectation is you can get software from wherever — you can hand it to your friend on a floppy disk and run it, that’s part of the expectation. But Mac users also expect a degree of flexibility that is useful to what they do. Some of them are software developers, some of them are pros running their unique tools, and having that power is part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUhnG6"&gt;I think of it is as if the Mac is a car — that you can take it off-road if you want, you can drive wherever you want. And that comes with as a driver, you gotta be trained, there’s a certain level of responsibility in doing that, but that’s what you wanted to buy. You wanted to buy a car. With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — can operate an iOS device, and be safe in doing so. So it’s a really different product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDAns"&gt;Federighi expanded on the metaphor a little later, when Apple’s counsel asked if macOS was “safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PwNnbL"&gt;Safe if operated correctly, much like that car. If you know how to operate a car, and you obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes. If you’re not — I’ve had a couple of family members who’ve gotten some malware on their Mac. But ultimately, I think the Mac can be operated safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="t6VTp5"&gt;I find the mental image of slowly, cautiously “driving” a Mac around the internet hilarious, because cars are deadly two-ton metal boxes that crush obstacles at superhuman speeds, while my MacBook starts losing keys if I type on it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHRkbD"&gt;If you pair these comments with some earlier statements about macOS, though, it’s a bit less funny. Federighi was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444353/mac-malware-not-acceptable-craig-federighi-apple-epic"&gt;bluntly critical&lt;/a&gt; of macOS security, saying Apple saw “a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable.” If you used the Mac’s security model on the iPhone, “with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said. “iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today.” It’s a distinctly negative evaluation of open computing systems, implying only&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a relatively small platform could afford that openness without disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzU8Lt"&gt;Federighi took a far broader view of security than Epic’s own expert witness James Mickens. Mickens testified earlier that iOS wasn’t meaningfully more secure than Android, but he analyzed mostly technical threats to the platforms. Federighi focused on scams, phishing, and other apps that target human psychology instead of computer code — many of which pose serious dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grIJu8"&gt;Sometimes, though, the protectiveness felt patronizing. When Federighi explained Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming, he focused partly on tangible security issues, like how to grant device permissions for different titles on a single gaming app. But he slipped seamlessly into discussing how the concept would be simply too confusing — that iPhone and iPad owners would be befuddled by the notion of launching a separate game catalog. Apple wants iOS devices to feel trustworthy, but at times like that, it seems more like Apple just doesn’t trust its own users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zagg’s new iPad cases are affordable alternatives to the Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zs1gbbziPIX9enVihJVvr94SiW8=/125x0:875x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69315396/zagg_ipad_pro_keys_with_trackpad_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DmLdno"&gt;Zagg has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2Fkeyboards%3Fcj_aid%3D12670080%26cj_pid%3D9173227%26cj_sid%3D%26cjdata%3DMXxOfDB8WXww%26cjevent%3De4ff189fb8f911eb80f200050a1c0e13&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F20%2F22444822%2Fzagg-pro-keys-trackpad-keyboard-case-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new selection of iPad keyboards&lt;/a&gt;: the Pro Keys with Trackpad, a case with a detachable Bluetooth keyboard; the laptop-style Rugged Book with an adjustable magnetic hinge; and the trackpad-less Pro Keys case (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/19/zagg-pro-keys-ipad-trackpad-case/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50rNSG"&gt;The accessories support several of Apple’s newest iPads, from the M1-enabled iPad Pro on the high-end to the entry level 10.2-inch iPad. Good alternative keyboard cases to Apple’s trackpad-equipped Magic Keyboard are mostly limited to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Mix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s Pro Plus&lt;/a&gt;, so Zagg’s version is more than welcome, if a bit less sleek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6nqDP"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, the Pro Keys with Trackpad has a case that wraps around your entire iPad and a detachable backlit Bluetooth keyboard that also doubles as an adjustable stand when magnetically attached. Along with the trackpad, which can be independently turned off to save battery, the case also includes a built-in protective cover for the Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjpBf1"&gt;Based off Zagg’s photos, it seems pretty thick, but the keyboard case is almost half the price of the Magic Keyboard. The Pro Keys with Trackpad costs $149.99 for 11-inch iPad Pros and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the less powerful 10.2-inch iPad, it costs $139.99. There’s no version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SHQI5OeLB3VWqxC-L7Zy-JhLxCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527010/pk_trackpad_detachable_tile.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys with Trackpad case has a detachable keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="41bH6b"&gt;Zagg’s new Rugged Book is much closer to Brydge’s laptop-style keyboard cases. It’s thick, though in this case intentionally, and Zagg claims it has 6.6 feet of drop protection. The keyboard is still a backlit Bluetooth keyboard, but attaches via an adjustable magnetic hinge that should offer more viewing angles. It’s trackpad-free in this case, but the same price as the Pro Keys with Trackpad. The Rugged Book costs $149.99 and works with both the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hU0Rtj3oF1EOmZbAE1HUIwUIqP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527012/01_hero_33_3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Rugged Book has better drop protection, but lacks a trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2pNcc0"&gt;Finally, there’s the Pro Keys case, which is the most stripped down and straightforward of the bunch. Like its name suggests, it shares a lot of similarities in design to the Pro Keys with Trackpad, just without the trackpad. Like Apple’s Smart Keyboard Folio cases, the Pro Keys case offers two main viewing angles, but since it’s technically an iPad case and a keyboard cover, you can theoretically stay protected without the keyboard attached. The Pro Keys case costs $109.99 for the 11-inch iPad Pro models and 10.9-inch iPad Air. For the 2018 to 2021 12.9-inch iPad, the Pro Keys case costs $169.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHENkC-F5i9AUce2RpWkkjH_dlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527016/01_hero_33_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zagg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zagg’s Pro Keys lacks a trackpad, but is also less expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
