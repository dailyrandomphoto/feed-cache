    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Right now, Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods are selling for their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has discounted the earbuds to $89.99 (with delayed shipping), which is less than what we saw them go for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In fact, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently selling for less than they were last month. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $139.99, yet, just like their predecessor, with delayed shipping. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAirPodsdeals1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so. You will, however, be able to get the earbuds in time for the holidays, if you intend to use them as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $169 in-store at Staples until December 18th. If you miss out on that deal, they’re also going for $179 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $179.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $70 discount off the cost you’d pay through Apple directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for around $479 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly going to make more of its own chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqPpYNbvftEmMdmVKKeMhMRR8yI=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282304/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uziLaj"&gt;Apple is reportedly working to design more chip components in-house, with the company said to be establishing a new office with the aim of replacing components that Apple currently sources from Broadcom and Skyworks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/apple-builds-team-in-new-office-to-bring-wireless-chips-in-house"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yzwE"&gt;The new office is said to be in its early stages but will eventually focus on “wireless radios, radio-frequency integrated circuits and a wireless system-on-a-chip,” in addition to “semiconductors for connecting to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12mJgk"&gt;While the A-series and M-series SoCs that contain the CPU and GPU for Apple’s iPhones and Macs get most of the attention, there are tons of additional chips inside those devices, handling things like power management, USB connectivity, wireless charging, and more. As &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22839850%2Fapple-office-develop-chips-in-house-broadcom-skyworks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’&lt;/em&gt;s iPhone 13 pro teardown&lt;/a&gt; documents, Skyworks and Broadcom supply a significant portion of the iPhone’s third-party circuitry — parts that Apple, it seems, would prefer to design on its own to create more bespoke solutions for its hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4HLXA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple wants to rely less on third-party suppliers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ETAvVH"&gt;One of the most prominent examples of third-party chips is the iPhone’s modem, which is currently manufactured by Qualcomm (but had previously been the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;years-long legal battle&lt;/a&gt; that briefly saw Apple switch to using Intel parts). Apple has made no secret about its ambitions to develop its own 5G chips instead of paying for Qualcomm’s chips, either: the company bought Intel’s smartphone modem business in 2019 for around $1 billion and is said to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800144/apple-own-iphone-modem-2023-tsmc-4nm"&gt;looking to switch over&lt;/a&gt; to its own in-house modems for the iPhone as early as 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6uxU8"&gt;That Apple is looking to build more of its own chips may not just be about exercising a greater level of control and hardware integration, though: it could also be about getting a better handle on part supply. Right now, Apple is already feeling the impact of the ongoing global chip shortage with supply issues for parts from suppliers like Broadcom, which forced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;Apple to slash its manufacturing targets back in October&lt;/a&gt;. Building its own chips could help Apple alleviate some of those issues in the future, assuming it’s able to continue to work well with its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UO2mYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Park in Cupertino" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lnpnMzFmSPR6ZAIBNuxzY3gu6ns=/0x0:5149x3433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279002/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date on which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to a letter that CEO Tim Cook sent to staff on Wednesday. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said the company’s date for returning to work, was “yet to be determined,” and he encouraged all employees to get the coronavirus vaccine and booster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HLBgb"&gt;“Our offices remain open and many of our colleagues are coming in regularly, including our teams in Greater China and elsewhere,” Cook wrote. “As we look forward to more of our teams being together again, we will continue to make decisions based on local conditions and will be sure to notify you at least four weeks before beginning the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awDSvn"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKPsQi"&gt;Cook also announced Wednesday that Apple would be giving all employees $1,000. “These funds are intended to help you with your home workspace and can be used as you see fit,” Cook wrote. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy confirmed the $1,000 bonus to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and says it will apply to every Apple employee, including retail workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgiBNs"&gt;An internal message to Apple employees said the $1,000 would appear in their next paychecks, and be subject to tax and withholding. “Keep in mind that when you return to the office, you’ll be bringing your Apple-owned equipment back, so you should consider what you’ll want for your home workspace,” the message reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed, and it’s not the first time Apple has announced such a delay; the company has shifted its pandemic-related return-to-office plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y94C8m"&gt;Cook told workers in the letter that he was “grateful” for their flexibility and resilience. “You continue to prove how much we can accomplish when we take on our challenges with boldness, creativity and — most importantly — together.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpPMjd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 10:54 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Cook’s letter to employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest AirPods are currently cheaper than they were on Black Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-II7Ukqd8GJx6lHJo0VIACbTo5I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70281083/akrales_190327_3315_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are just $89.99 right now at Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQuJMI"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are always a popular gift, but they can be expensive, regardless of which model you opt for. Thankfully, you can currently nab the entry-level model for less than $100, making them a great present for friends and family if you don’t mind waiting until &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcMZA1"&gt;Right now, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling Apple’s second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with delayed shipping for $89.99, matching their lowest price to date. It’s also less than what we saw them for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. The last-gen earbuds may be older and lack the wireless charging case found on the more expensive configuration, but they still offer great wireless performance, reliable battery life, and excellent ease of use, making them a terrific pick for Apple users shopping on a budget. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale at Amazon for $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is the price we saw them going for on Black Friday. Just keep in mind that they may not ship until after Christmas, meaning they’d likely make for a belated gift. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mEO1Uv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10887582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XxOP0O"&gt;Speaking of all-time lows, if you’re on the hunt for a great, lightweight laptop that’s under $1,000, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-Touch-Screen-Ryzen/dp/B08YWX4W7G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; at its lowest price ever. Regularly $999.99, right now you can pick up the 13.5-inch configuration for $877.79, a $122 discount. To get this deal, you need to select the model that comes with a 256GB SSD, an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;6-core CPU, and 8GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRSXAE"&gt;Note this is the smaller, less powerful version of the 15-inch model that comes with the Ryzen 7 4980U chip we tested, which we praised for its excellent battery life and performance. Nonetheless, it’s still a good laptop with a mid-tier processor that’s fine for streaming shows, using social media, and carrying out other everyday tasks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iQHmdq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LnLzf"&gt;Shifting away from laptops to e-readers, Amazon’s kid-friendly Kindle Paperwhite makes for a great holiday gift both children and parents will love. It’s a fun way to get a child into reading that’s ad-free and comes with parental controls, and right now it’s selling at its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7dvdL"&gt;Typically $159.99, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently selling the new Kindle Paperwhite Kids&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a bigger display and a USB-C port, for $119.99 in all colorways and designs. That’s just $5 more than the price we saw on Black Friday. The waterproof e-reader, released only a few months ago, also comes with a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids Plus, which provides access to thousands of kid-friendly books as well as hundreds of Audible audiobooks. Amazon is also throwing in a two-year warranty, so if it breaks, you can return it and the company will replace it for free. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full 2021 Kindle Paperwhite review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="saCmT0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05Un3F"&gt;As we get closer to the holidays, several retailers are selling discounted gaming-related gift cards that can come in handy whether you’re looking for a present or you just want to save some money. Now through December 17th, Costco members can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/nintendo-eshop-%2450-digital-card.product.100431276.html"&gt;$50 digital Nintendo eShop gift card for $39.99&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-%24100-gift-card-digital-download.product.100524149.html"&gt;$100 digital Xbox gift card for $79.99&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which can be applied toward both current and next-gen titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YbomSw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10926235"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kt5FXu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10506009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rALVbI"&gt;If you’re on the hunt for budget-friendly gifts you can still get before the holidays, today’s discount on the new Roku Express 4K Plus may be worth a look. Typically $39.99, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/dp/B0916TKFF2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;streaming stick is going for $24 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is an all-time low and $5 less than the Black Friday price. In comparison to its predecessor, the Roku Premiere, the entry-level 4K streamer comes with a faster processor and increased internal storage. It also offers support for HDR10 Plus and AirPlay 2, while sporting features like dual-band Wi-Fi and the ability to attach a Micro-USB-to-ethernet adapter if you’d prefer a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hzamnT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10925733"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso gets a cute claymation holiday short</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeiJTVfbFLjvpnIAieWa-E0lRk0=/76x0:904x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279055/121521_Ted_Lasso_Animated_Holiday_Short_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOMZTH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22590155/ted-lasso-apple-tv-plus-season-2-review"&gt;Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ended on something of a dark note, but everything is all nice and friendly again in a new holiday short. It’s called “The Missing Christmas Mustache,” and, like many classic holiday specials, it’s rendered in cute and charming claymation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgBvsf"&gt;It features voices of the main cast — including Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/9/1/22652236/ted-lasso-roy-kent-cgi-conspiracy-theory"&gt;definitely-not-CGI Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; — as they search for a missing mustache. It’s only four minutes long, so I won’t spoil too much, only to say you should at least watch to learn a little more about Roy Kent’s eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myJnzA"&gt;If nothing else, it makes up for the poorly-timed Christmas episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; that aired in August — and threw my sense of time and date even further out of whack. And it’s a nice little taste of the show’s wholesomeness while we all wait for season 3 to come to Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;Apple has also reportedly pushed back its plans to return its corporate workers to the office. Its latest plan was to have employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;come back on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; under a hybrid work model, but that plan has been delayed to a “yet to be determined” date, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;’ Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. An email from Tim Cook announced that employees would get $1,000 to spend on their home office, Schiffer reported. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-delays-return-to-office-until-date-yet-to-be-determined?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, retail employees will also receive this bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m6ul"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 5:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Apple delaying its return to the office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltw8Az"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 7:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about retail employees receiving bonus as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yXX3ot"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple delays full office reopening and is giving every employee a $1,000 bonus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838471/apple-delays-office-reopening-date-covid-19"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Swift Playgrounds 4 is live on the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYSvEvjw7Zi-az0QEAAqfGSjwKY=/0x57:2400x1657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278648/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_create_ipad_screen.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWNBaw"&gt;Apple’s Swift Playgrounds 4 is upon us. Announced earlier this year at Apple’s WWDC, the new app allows users to develop apps for iOS and iPadOS directly on an iPad. You can preview apps in real time while you work on them and send them directly to the App Store when you’re done. The program is now live on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492"&gt;App Store for iPad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8rza"&gt;“Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code,” Apple claimed in &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e&amp;amp;1639593362"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s developer website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Swift Playgrounds 4 on an iPad with a white keyboard attached over a white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPSH37UPfXghgDRbCfCE_IAE3SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23099602/12152021_iPad_Swift_Launch_app_ipad_screen.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friendly, colorful interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eRp10i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924120/apple-swift-playground-app-teaches-kids-to-code"&gt;Previous iterations of Swift Playgrounds&lt;/a&gt; have largely been targeted at children. They’re meant to teach beginners how to code in Swift, and they do so through a series of friendly and colorful puzzles. It has not, in the past, functioned as a standalone developer tool — this is the first time that coders will be able to build full apps within the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mfm5p"&gt;Apps for iPhone and iPad are largely built and distributed in Xcode, a famously complicated application that only runs on macOS. Developers have been calling for an iPad version of Xcode for years, and while this isn’t exactly that, it could still help to lower the barrier to entry for new iPhone and iPad developers who want to try out their ideas without investing in a Mac. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE4bW86HfAYrTlwzmeUDjm5YN-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277130/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe brings two more desktop tools to Photoshop on iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpApUXWY0MjymkbAmWE3Ov0u8aE=/59x0:1607x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270870/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.32.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8QGix"&gt;&lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/mobile-2022-1.html"&gt;Adobe has updated Photoshop for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; with two crucial new tools — the smudge and sponge tools, which have been mainstays on the desktop version of the app but absent on mobile until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fbG1H"&gt;The smudge tool (as the name suggests) is used to help blur and blend lines or colors together and comes with the usual settings for adjusting size and strength of the effect, along with a variety of modes (including normal, darken, lighten, hue, saturation, color, and luminosity). The sponge tool, on the other hand, works to help retouch images by saturating or desaturating color, allowing users to fine-tune how vibrant their images and art look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DjKsJrK9ogKA23FoYIW2adXEQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087711/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_2.34.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="12RbGa"&gt;Additionally, Adobe also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/whats-new.html"&gt;new update for Premiere Pro on desktop&lt;/a&gt;, adding key performance improvements for M1-powered Macs. With the new update, all M1 Macs now work with hardware-accelerated exports for DCI 4K and 8K HEVC formats, which Adobe says will result in “significantly faster performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2H3C7"&gt;Additionally, Adobe is also offering hardware acceleration for ProRes videos on the M1 Max and M1 Pro chips in the latest MacBook Pro laptops, offering up to five times faster performance. Windows users with integrated Intel GPUs are also getting a boost, with improvements to video playback, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJva5p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is requiring masks again at all US retail stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFTDMXcCnSWV9xPeXmYwluX9qjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270378/acastro_190530_1777_wwdc_2019_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sOfkHh"&gt;Apple is again requiring customers to wear masks in all its US retail stores after it had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;reportedly rolled back the mandate for around half of its locations&lt;/a&gt;. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the company said that “amid rising cases in many communities, we now require that all customers join our team members in wearing masks while visiting our stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqYlz"&gt;While employees have been required to wear masks throughout most of the pandemic, customers haven’t always had to, which has led to outbreaks at some Apple stores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1470808052186161155"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that some locations will have occupancy limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5IAIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple reportedly started dropping mask mandates for some stores in November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8jhBI"&gt;Apple’s current mask policy was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763958/apple-mask-requirements-retail-store-customers-coronavirus"&gt;reportedly enacted in early November&lt;/a&gt; when some retail stores dropped the requirement following increased vaccination rates and decreased infection rates. This cycle seems to be a repeat of what happened this summer — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;started relaxing mask requirements&lt;/a&gt; for some stores in June but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;brought them back&lt;/a&gt; at most locations in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdyi7h"&gt;Apple is reinstating these requirements as the number of COVID infections in the US is again on the rise, even as booster shots start to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i65K1T"&gt;This change also comes after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;widespread outbreak was reported at an Apple store&lt;/a&gt; in Southlake, Texas, earlier this month. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;According to NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, 22 employees at the location tested positive for COVID following Black Friday, where some staff reported that customers (who were not required to wear masks) were packed into the store “shoulder to shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ljTxM"&gt;Apple also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures in stores to support the wellbeing of customers and employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
