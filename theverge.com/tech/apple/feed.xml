    <title>Apple pay equity and harassment organizer will leave the company after reaching a settlement</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TASCwe"&gt;Cher Scarlett, an Apple engineer who helped organize pay equity surveys and anti-harassment / discrimination campaigns at the company, will be leaving the company and requesting the withdrawal of a complaint she made to the National Labor Relations Board (or NLRB), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/apple-worker-who-led-protest-movement-leaving-after-settlement?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The software engineer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Friday would be her last day at Apple. Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that she had reached a private settlement with the company, but she declined to provide details about the terms when asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lECwx"&gt;Scarlett is leaving voluntarily, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, unlike some other organizers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;were fired from the company after speaking out&lt;/a&gt;. During her time at Apple, she &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/14/apple-worker-cher-scarlett/"&gt;was reportedly accused of leaking information to the press&lt;/a&gt; by other employees, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;that’s strongly discouraged by Apple leadership&lt;/a&gt;, and that she denies doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YRB9ez"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Friday is my last day at Apple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m taking a bit of time to decide where I’d like to go next, and will announce when I’ve made that decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett   (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1461078948436054016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV0cDB"&gt;The charge she’s requested be withdrawn was filed in September, when Scarlett said that Apple had “engaged in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She made the complaint after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;she and others at the company struggled to conduct a pay equity survey&lt;/a&gt; for Apple employees, with the company repeatedly shutting down their attempts. Scarlett also told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that Apple wouldn’t allow employees to create a Slack room to talk about pay equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sqW6Lc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tim Cook says employees who leak memos do not belong at Apple, according to leaked memo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5l5Esy"&gt;Scarlett withdrawing her complaint won’t necessarily leave Apple in the clear — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759715/fired-apple-too-organizer-files-labor-charge-nlrb"&gt;faces a number of other complaints&lt;/a&gt;, including ones alleging wrongful termination from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;other employees Scarlett worked with&lt;/a&gt; to organize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt;. #AppleToo aimed to get support for Apple employees who experienced discrimination or harassment if the company’s policies failed to provide it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H74v6"&gt;Scarlett’s lawyers told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that they hoped the company’s employees would continue to organize, a sentiment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729072/apple-too-organizer-janneke-parrish-interview"&gt;echoed by other activists&lt;/a&gt; that are no longer with the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rittenhouse defense requests a mistrial after iPhone Mail app compresses key video evidence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jury Deliberates In Kyle Rittenhouse Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1HjlvEJ6r9EY5TzKd0ox35zngE=/0x0:5222x3481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70157401/1236627321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Krajacic - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gC8mJP"&gt;The Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin has once again gone off track because of basic technology problems: Rittenhouse’s defense attorneys today requested a mistrial because prosecutors sent them a drone video via email, which compressed the video in size. This is after earlier arguments about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim"&gt;what pinch-to-zoom does or does not do&lt;/a&gt;, and the judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778801/kyle-rittenhouse-bruce-schroeder-screenshot-zoom-in"&gt;struggling with the screenshot features on his Galaxy S20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2bUF6"&gt;Rittenhouse faces five felony charges for shooting three men and killing two of them last year during a protest in Kenosha. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-verdict-watch-11-17-21/index.html"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt; the motion for a mistrial is focused on when and how defense attorneys received a copy of a drone video showing the shootings that was shown to the jury in open court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0md2S"&gt;Rittenhouse’s lawyers say they only received a copy of the drone video on November 5th, after the trial started, and that instead of the 11.2MB video possessed by the state, the file they received was just 3.6MB. “What that means is the video provided to the defense was not as clear as the video kept by the state,” the motion for mistrial claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfntYj"&gt;Prosecutors say they only obtained the video file directly from the drone operator after the trial started — the footage was already public, as it had aired on The Tucker Carlson Show on Fox News within days of the shooting during an appearance by the defendant’s first attorney, and a lower-quality version of the video was part of the defense’s exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kg07HA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file. We did not know that this would occur.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QxzwE2"&gt;The prosecutors said the individual who took the footage came to investigators after the trial had started and transferred a higher-quality version of the video to a detective via AirDrop. The detective brought the video to court, and minutes after his arrival the prosecution told defense attorneys that they had obtained a much better quality version of the video than was previously available. The detective emailed a copy to Rittenhouse’s attorney Natalie Wisco, who uses an Android mobile device, and she transferred that file to the defense’s laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjCQTk"&gt;Assistant District Attorney James Kraus told the court that “going from an iPhone to an Android, it appears, somehow compressed the file [...] we did not know that this would occur. We gave what we fully believed was the full file to Ms. Wisco [...] it came in without objection and was an exhibit for four days, displayed for the jury on full screen.” The prosecution says that they did not know the version she received was of lower quality until just a few days ago when Wisco displayed the file she had received on a defense laptop in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7Bjkb"&gt;The iPhone’s Mail app &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-attachments-iph8580f163b/15.0/ios/15.0"&gt;automatically compresses video files sent as an attachment&lt;/a&gt;, and the defense attorney describes getting a renamed .mov file in a format that sounds exactly like an Apple Mail-app compressed video from an iPhone user. The defense was ultimately able to retrieve the full-resolution video file after sending an attorney to collect it on a USB stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXKcch"&gt;Wisconsin defense attorney Jessa Nicholson Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “it is not normal that video or other electronic evidence is AirDropped to defense counsel in the middle of a trial. That is &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; atypical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiVoy6"&gt;According to Goetz, Wisconsin law says that “any evidence that the state intends to use at trial must be disclosed ‘at a reasonable time before trial,’” and that “a mid-trial AirDrop in no way meets the requirements.” She also notes that prosecutors and courts in Wisconsin routinely handle video evidence. “Many police departments have body cams required, and virtually all squad cars statewide are equipped with video that turns on automatically if the vehicle’s emergency lights are activated. All of those videos are regularly provided via flash drive or CD-ROM/DVD,” says Goetz. “I have never encountered receiving a different or lower quality version of video evidence than the original video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKtsxe"&gt;As for why the procedures for handling evidence in this case seem so sloppy, Goetz tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that evidentiary rules vary from county to county, with some courts that use online portals to transfer files back and forth, some that require mailed hard copies, and others that require prosecutors to allow defense attorneys to physically retrieve whatever files they need on USB drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XNBYV"&gt;Rittenhouse’s defense initially requested a mistrial with prejudice, which would have prevented the case from being tried again. It has dropped the “with prejudice” from the request, and so far the judge has not ruled on the motion, even as the jury deliberates and looks at the video. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-live-jurors-set-to-begin-second-day-of-deliberations/2686647/"&gt;NBC 5 News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder says resolving the issue will require testimony from an expert witness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your iPhone 12 or 13 is having issues with calls, updating iOS may help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzOzZiGzLh0VtWA7ztijbsr3KgM=/0x0:2019x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70156363/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8Gk5O"&gt;A new iOS update is starting to hit phones — no, not the seemingly feature-packed iOS 15.2, but iOS 15.1.1, which Apple says will solve an issue with calls dropping. According to the update note, the new version of iOS “improves call drop performance on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWdorh"&gt;While we haven’t seen large amounts of users complaining about their new-model iPhones dropping more calls than normal, it’s nice to see that Apple is paying attention to how its phones perform as, well, phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWl7X5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;15.1.1 is worth updating to if you’ve been having issues with calls dropping&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igyTso"&gt;You can update to iOS 15.1.1 by going to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. If you find updating to be a pain and haven’t been experiencing any call issues, though, it may be best to just wait for iOS 15.2 — the beta has been absolutely packed with features, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;improvements to the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;addition of the App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774124/ios-15-2-beta-2-airtag-tracker-scan-privacy-invasion"&gt;manually scan for suspicious AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and more. That update seems to be coming soon, so waiting to go through the update process would be understandable, especially given that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;not reporting any major security patches in 15.1.1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The shareholder fight that forced Apple’s hand on repair rights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsFCsRYONNdeXoArLCZ2tyZWA0=/0x25:592x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155770/ifixit_teardown_iphone_13_pro.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928?vgo_ee=3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aANBG1"&gt;Wednesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon make parts and repair manuals available to the general public, reversing years of restrictive repair policies. The new policy represents a seismic shift for a company that has fought independent repair for years by restricting access to parts, manuals, and diagnostic tools, designing products that are difficult to fix, and lobbying against laws that would enshrine the right to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHPqCC"&gt;But Apple didn’t change its policy out of the goodness of its heart. The announcement follows months of growing pressure from repair activists and regulators — and its timing seems deliberate, considering a &lt;a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-shareholder-proposal-presses-apple-to-expand-access-to-repair/"&gt;shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; environmental advocates filed with the company in September asking Apple to re-evaluate its stance on independent repair. Wednesday is a key deadline in the fight over the resolution, with advocates poised to bring the issue to the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdtzSp"&gt;Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the program “has been in development for well over a year,” describing it as “the next step in increasing customer access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and manuals.” Leahy declined to say whether the timing of the announcement was influenced by shareholder pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nffZMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WLSKQt"&gt;Activist shareholders believe that it was.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence,” says Annalisa Tarizzo, an advocate with Green Century, the mutual fund company that filed the right-to-repair resolution with Apple in September. As a result of today’s announcement, Green Century is withdrawing its resolution, which asked Apple to “reverse its anti repair practices” and evaluate the benefits of making parts and tools more available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4PEX"&gt;That’s exactly what Apple seems to be doing with its new Self Service Repair program. Announced this morning, the program will allow members of the general public to order genuine Apple parts in order to make basic iPhone repairs at home — something Apple has long argued is too dangerous for individuals to do. According to Apple, Self Service Repair will initially focus on the display, battery, and camera for iPhone 12 and 13 models. Individuals interested in doing screen repairs or battery replacements for those models at home will be able to place an order for genuine Apple parts through a new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store, send in their old part for recycling, and receive a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNaBN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAhiz"&gt;Apple’s announcement of the program is light on details, including whether the program will be expanded beyond iPhone 12 and 13 as well as Mac computers using M1 chips, how much genuine parts will cost customers, and whether it will eventually make parts available for a wider range of repairs. Although the announcement implies it will, Leahy declined to confirm that the program will eventually be expanded to other iPhone models. Still, the announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies to facilitate independent repair — assuming the tech giant follows through with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byZEva"&gt;Apple’s initial response to the Green Century resolution was less than conciliatory. Tarizzo says that on October 18 (30 days before the self service announcement), Apple submitted a “no action request” to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the investor oversight body to block the proposal. According to Tarizzo, Apple’s argument before the SEC was that the proposal — that the company “prepare a report” on the environmental and social benefits of making its devices easier to fix — ran afoul of shareholder proposal guidance by infringing on Apple’s normal business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gHGaA"&gt;However, earlier this month, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/staff-legal-bulletin-14l-shareholder-proposals"&gt;issued new guidance&lt;/a&gt; concerning no-action requests that includes a carve-out for proposals that raise “significant social policy issues.” In other words, shareholders &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; bring resolutions that affect a company’s day-to-day business operations if those proposals raise issues with significant societal impact. Tarizzo believes that this change made it much more likely the SEC would side with Green Century rather than Apple, particularly since the mutual fund company connected the dots between increased access to repair and the fight against climate change. (Using devices as long as possible through maintenance and repair is &lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/apples-new-iphone-is-far-from-green-1803f4f9a58a"&gt;one of the best ways to reduce the climate impact&lt;/a&gt; of consumer technology since the majority of the emissions associated with our gadgets occur during the manufacturing stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1Dj9C"&gt;“It wasn’t a guarantee that the SEC would side with us, but the new guidance indicates it’s very likely we would prevail,” Tarizzo says. “It effectively took away a lot of Apple’s leverage in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX8BDL"&gt;Now, Apple seems to have regained some leverage by announcing its new Self Service Repair program on the same day that Green Century was required to respond to the no-action request. Instead of arguing that the SEC should allow the shareholder resolution to move forward, Green Century is now withdrawing the resolution entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpEfic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNN0P"&gt;Companies routinely ignore shareholder resolutions, and many had assumed Apple would respond to Green Century’s resolution the same way — but it came at a time of unique momentum for the right-to-repair cause. This year, a &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/half-us-states-looking-give-americans-right-repair"&gt;record 27 states&lt;/a&gt; have considered right to repair bills, and the first national right to repair bill was introduced to Congress &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/news/usp/broad-right-repair-bill-introduced-congress"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. None have passed into law, but they’ve sent an alarming message to companies like Apple that restrictive repair practices may not be legal for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Iwf5"&gt;That’s also resulted in pressure from the federal government. In May, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/should-customers-be-able-to-repair-their-devices-this-federal-agency-says-yes/"&gt;came out strongly in favor of independent repair&lt;/a&gt; with the release of a report finding “scant evidence” to justify restrictions imposed by companies like Apple. In July, President Biden himself &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the FTC to craft new regulations that would limit the ability of cell phone makers to restrict DIY repair. Those rules are a long way from coming into effect, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-ramp-law-enforcement-against-illegal-repair-restrictions"&gt;specter of looming regulations&lt;/a&gt; was certainly a factor in Apple’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syQVvj"&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies, adding even more pressure on the company. Last month, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to comply with a first-of-its-kind right-to-repair resolution brought by environmental nonprofit &lt;em&gt;As You Sow &lt;/em&gt;in June. The resolution asked Microsoft to study the environmental and social benefits of increasing access to repair; Microsoft not only agreed to conduct such a study but to act on the findings by the end of 2022. Microsoft’s concession to activist shareholders came on the heels of Green Century filing a similar shareholder resolution with Apple, a move activists speculated could pressure on the iPhone maker to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="niFteq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66i69y"&gt;The result is a huge victory for Green Century and a validation for shareholder activism more broadly. Tarizzo says that while Apple’s new program “doesn’t go all the way where we want the company to go, we think it’s a significant enough step that it warrants a withdrawal. The fact they’ll be selling common replacement parts, tools, releasing repair manuals, it’s all very much in the spirit of what we were hoping to see happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Jw4g"&gt;While Tarizzo feels that the timing of Apple’s announcement is directly related to Green Century’s shareholder resolution, she believes the company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement” from federal action to statehouse bills to grassroots advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V0KOE"&gt;Nathan Proctor, the senior right to repair campaign director at the US Public Research Interest Group, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXq9yf"&gt;“If I was to hazard a guess, it would be the whole compilation of the campaign has successfully changed Apple’s position,” Proctor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I don’t think you can point to any one particular thing that was done that made it happen. It all made it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will sell you iPhone parts to fix your own phone at home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cG_qw6mF0FCWwz8VDwJ9he1CJkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154312/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyEEYp"&gt;Apple is opening up iPhones and Macs to DIY repairs. The company plans to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;start selling parts and tools&lt;/a&gt; and offering instructions on how to repair Apple products at home, without having to bring them into a store or a third-party repair shop. Apple plans to start with the iPhone 12 and 13, followed by Macs with M1 chips. You’ll be able to replace the iPhone’s display, battery, and camera using parts from Apple at first, with other options coming later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZtWhO"&gt;This is a huge shift from Apple, which has historically been resistant to the right-to-repair movement and from any repairs happening outside of its own stores. Even this week, Apple was walking back software that prevented Face ID from working if customers replaced their own screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6LQLi5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit celebrated the move but noted some substantial caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TXbQYL"&gt;Apple is calling the program “Self Service Repair,” and it’ll launch “early next year” in the US and then expand to other countries. The company says the program is only meant for “individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices” and that most customers should still go to a professional. But Apple is at least now offering an option for the customers who do feel comfortable undertaking the repair on their own. Critically, making these repairs yourself won’t void a device’s warrant, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although damaging your device in the process still might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1h2738"&gt;The change also helps to further entrench Apple in the repair process. The company already has a program to sell “genuine” parts to third-party repair shops, and today’s announcement makes it all the more likely customers will buy full-priced parts from Apple — parts that won’t trip off iPhone systems that try to prevent the use of components that weren’t bought from Apple — rather than looking for aftermarket options in the limited circumstances where that might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3htcR"&gt;iFixit, the go-to resource for DIY repair parts and instructions, &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/55370/apple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software"&gt;celebrated the move&lt;/a&gt; but noted that it came with substantial caveats. Apple’s decision is “a remarkable concession to our collective competency” and invalidates many of the arguments that Apple and other companies have made against right to repair, writes Elizabeth Chamberlain, iFixit’s director of sustainability. But Chamberlain notes that this still isn’t “the open-source repair revolution we’ve sought through our fight for the right to repair” because it appears to still support restrictions that require parts to be bought straight from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iNdlv"&gt;Apple says it plans to sell “more than 200 individual parts and tools.” The company will also offer repair manuals that customers can review before buying the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DVwdV"&gt;Pricing for the parts and tools hasn’t been announced. Apple says customers can receive a recycling credit for returning their used part after completing a repair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements don’t break Face ID in iOS 15.2 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11MpV1qW74-jkRK0vySgc-cvBw=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152317/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqHPpW"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that it would be rolling out a software update to iPhone 13 devices to make it easier to replace their screens without breaking Face ID, but it didn’t specify when that update might arrive. Fortunately, we may not have to wait long, as repair experts say they have successfully completed the easier screen swaps on iPhone 13 handsets running the iOS 15.2 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBnMV"&gt;Before the update, keeping Face ID working after swapping the screens also required moving over a microcontroller from the original phone to the new one. Doing so is a complex process, and having to do it for every iPhone 13 that needs a new screen could make things difficult for indie repair shops. (You can read all about the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786274%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But on an iPhone 13 loaded with the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9oFrfXq5o"&gt;still worked&lt;/a&gt; after a screen swap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; without having to bring over the microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NreKtM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f9oFrfXq5o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTblbM"&gt;Although Face ID still works, the screen-swapped iPhone 13 does show an “Important Display Message” warning that the device can’t verify is the screen is a “genuine Apple part” — even though &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says the screen actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a genuine part. This isn’t entirely out of the norm for Apple, though, which shows similar warnings on some iPhones following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805744/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-ios-safety-statement-unauthorized"&gt;battery replacements&lt;/a&gt; from unauthorized repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xG67U"&gt;Apple didn’t reply when we asked if it could confirm that iOS 15.2 is the version that will allow for the easier screen replacements when it’s released publicly. But given that the less-intensive screen swaps appear to work on the beta, it seems likely they will work in the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s new QuietComfort 45 are seeing their first price drop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yr13l0Yh25We617ksj2MwBbT6cg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70149112/cwelch_202109_4775_5625.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphones are selling for a discounted $279 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFDi1t"&gt;Some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now are Bose’s QuietComfort 45, and they’re selling at the lowest price we’ve seen yet. Just two months following their release, you can buy them for $279 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098FKXT8L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYqeoj9E2O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2ryLqz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; as a part of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sales&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a solid $50 price drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haBgJ3"&gt;If comfort is key, these are some of the most cozy headphones to wear. Like previous QuietComfort models, these can fold up and be stowed in the included zip-up case. They offer up to 24 hours of battery life per charge — you can even enjoy three hours of usage with just 15 minutes of charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nBWaEK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="x959qD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kdspCa"&gt;With the rare combo of being dynamic wall art and a 4K QLED TV in one, Samsung’s unique Frame TV is back down to its lowest price once again. Oddly, Amazon increased the price for this model last week, but now readers can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=58&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=59&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. When not in use, the TV displays customizable photos or art. But when you need to use it as a TV, it has handy features like Amazon’s Alexa built in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;You can also still buy these TVs for roughly the same prices at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Amazon, Best Buy is including a 30-day subscription to FuboTV Pro, if that dictates where you make your purchase. It's worth noting that while Amazon no longer offers a free six-month HBO Max subscription as it did earlier this month, there’s a possibility we could see a similar perk come back as Black Friday nears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFrYMb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gbIbTj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDfG83"&gt;Apple’s most affordable desktop computer, the 2020 Mac Mini, is currently the cheapest it’s ever been. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 256GB version for $600 instead of its typical $700 at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; is also offering it for the same price until November 29th, though you need to be a member to get it there for that price. Note that Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB version for $750&lt;/a&gt; at checkout instead of $899. You can place an order at that price, but it’s on backorder currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua3p2o"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that Apple’s M1-equipped Mac Mini outperforms most other Intel-based Macs, thanks to the M1 chip and its efficiently cooled chassis. It also comes with Wi-Fi 6 support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="el3DDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JRECoU"&gt;Prefer a Chromebook over a desktop computer? We’ve got you. The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is often on sale, but today’s discounts on both the 2020 and 2021 models are some of the best we’ve seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAFikk"&gt;Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt; for $529 instead of $699. It comes with 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Evo-certified 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor. Meanwhile, you can save more money without compromising on battery life or build quality by getting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; of that very same Chromebook. Typically $529, Best Buy is selling that one for $389. Though, it comes with just 4GB RAM, a slower 64GB eMMC SSD, and Intel’s 10th Gen Core i3 processor model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkS9HE"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin highly recommends both Acer Chromebook Spin 713 model, praising how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; outperformed many others at the time of its release in terms of features, build quality, and performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;, they wrote, improves on its predecessor with Thunderbolt 4 support and Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GSFkTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HReJCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JSQWF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Chris Welch, Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max — while a mouthful of a name — is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s “best straightforward 4K streamer.”&lt;/a&gt; And good news, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MQZXN1X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for the first time. Instead of paying its usual $55 cost, you can buy the stick for $35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5rn0n"&gt;Amazon’s latest flagship streaming stick supports Wi-Fi 6 and offers noticeably improved performance compared to the Fire TV Stick 4K. Apps launch faster and navigation feels more fluid, while there’s also support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10 Plus, and Dolby Atmos. Meanwhile, the updated remote in the box comes with handy shortcuts to live TV programming and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wiFh00"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eveFAD"&gt;If you prefer wireless earbuds to over-ear headphones, but you still crave active noise cancellation, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/164914311936?mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;amp;siteid=0&amp;amp;campid=5338794975&amp;amp;customid=VergeDeals110921&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;mkevt=1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/9/22770263/apple-airpods-google-pixelbook-hisense-tv-macbook-air-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22534304__t_w__r_theverge.com/authors__d_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay’&lt;/a&gt;s deal on a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t buds is tough to pass up. You can get them for $95 through Jabra’s digital storefront. Up until now, eBay was selling the pair for a discounted $100, meaning you can now save about $135 off the new cost. Jabra says that although these may have minor blemishes, they’ve been inspected and cleaned and include all original accessories. The pair also comes with a two-year warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PmJQyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Hvihc6"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other good deals we found:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lSDZjd"&gt;Apple’s AirTag Loop, which securely attaches the AirTag Bluetooth tracker to backpacks and other items, is selling for an Amazon all-time low. Typically $29, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932LZM6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the deep navy version for $21.96 instead.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Disney is giving its characters a license to brawl in this Apple-exclusive game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUD4t6pnre6XxT6gkRHEH4e0ihA=/97x0:1126x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146013/chrome_ghGnbrfT8M.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DgKL5"&gt;If you’ve dreamt of the day Disney would wake up and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22736493/smash-bros-ultimate-disney-micky-mouse-sora-woody"&gt;see the huge potential&lt;/a&gt; in creating its own take on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; fighting game... that day has not yet come. But Disney may have just taken a step toward that future with &lt;em&gt;Disney Melee Mania&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple Arcade exclusive coming this December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4yXOg"&gt;While we’ve only gotten the briefest glimpses from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697"&gt;the game’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; (below) and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/disney-melee-mania-coming-this-december-exclusively-on-apple-arcade/"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; today, it actually does feature Disney and Pixar characters like Elsa, Moana, and Buzz Lightyear smacking each other around with their powers, laser beams, and one mean oar in search of a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j0OrHA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Head in the game? Disney and Pixar's holo-arena awaits in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyMeleeMania?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyMeleeMania&lt;/a&gt; ⭐️Coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleArcade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppleArcade&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG"&gt;https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uwVMUCa7Vz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uwVMUCa7Vz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney Melee Mania (@playmeleemania) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSY9cz"&gt;Here’s how Apple describes the 3v3 MOBA-esque game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pelAJW"&gt;Each champion will appear in a distinct action-ready design equipped with their own set of iconic moves and unlockable cosmetics. Throughout five-minute matches bursting with battle arena action, players will need to score the most points possible — or defeat the opposing team as many times as they can — for a chance at victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jdMwtU"&gt;Apple’s promising 12 characters to start, and more to come, presumably all included in your Apple Arcade subscription fee — $5 a month with no ads and no in-app purchases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;is Apple Arcade’s whole deal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUhzw"&gt;So far, we’ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k4ybe6"&gt;Wreck It-Ralph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="466dUU"&gt;Moana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lHMTBj"&gt;Elsa (&lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NNn6Rt"&gt;Buzz Lightyear (&lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2k3o3e"&gt;Mickey Mouse (with his Sorcerer’s Apprentice costume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Md5j8b"&gt;Frozone (&lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t3ryDD"&gt;Bing Bong (&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUASo"&gt;Jasmine (&lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRIwlO"&gt;Timon (&lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xzxhsj"&gt;Maleficent (&lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4rrQqv"&gt;It’s from a studio called Mighty Bear Games, which brought &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/butter-royale/id1464623715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Apple Arcade last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter Blue’s Nuzzel-like top articles summary has arrived for iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U47MV3jDHzxQ6koU6x0q6tUQkqc=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145890/3_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Top_Articles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVYlHC"&gt;Twitter’s Top Articles feature, which creates a report of articles popular in Blue subscribers’ networks, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322"&gt;now available on iOS&lt;/a&gt; after the company promised last week that it’d be coming “very soon.” It’s been available on Android and the web, but now everyone who subscribes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;Twitter’s paid service&lt;/a&gt; should be able to see a roundup of what people were reading and tweeting about over the past day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o2l0q"&gt;Top Articles is a sort of spiritual successor to a service called Nuzzel, which provided a similar roundup through email. Nuzzel was run by a company called Scroll, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;was shut down when Twitter acquired the company&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Twitter said at the time it planned to bring Nuzzel back, and now its most popular feature is available to anyone who is willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;pay the price for Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;. The premium service also gives users extra features like the ability to “undo” tweets or read ad-free articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2BJmp2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Available now on iOS — see what your network is sharing in the last 24 hours with Top Articles so you’ll always know what’s *really* going on. Check it out and add it to your Custom Navigation bar &lt;a href="https://t.co/NxLW8fTTPn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NxLW8fTTPn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZIJYK"&gt;While Twitter Blue subscribers who miss Nuzzel will likely be excited that Top Articles is now available on all the major platforms, it does feel like there should be a lite-version for those who don’t want to directly pay for Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De2bNi"&gt;While it makes sense that ad-free articles will incur a subscription cost, Twitter Blue as a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"&gt;creates the impression that Twitter is paywalling basic features&lt;/a&gt; that should be available to everyone, regardless of which tier of Twitter they’re using. In that vein, Threader (an app that makes Twitter threads more readable by formatting them as articles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threader/status/1460258719711694855?s=20"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it had been acquired by Twitter, and that it would be included in Twitter Blue. While this is likely good news for those with Blue, it being paywalled won’t help general Twitter users navigate threads any easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HNsPlf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon releases Prime Video app for Mac with downloads, AirPlay, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_MW0Sxkf8z-gbm8nPCZHmfrxbA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145372/DSCF6095.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JkQ8Ir"&gt;Better late than never, as they say: Amazon today launched a Prime Video app for macOS that’s available as &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333"&gt;a free download in the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Video for Mac includes support for offline downloads, and you can choose your preferred video quality both for regular streaming and downloads. (At the “best” setting, Amazon estimates around 5.8GB of data usage per hour when streaming. The figure is slightly lower for downloads, with Amazon quoting 2.9GB per hour of downloaded video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCaHFu"&gt;When you first open Prime Video for Mac, the app asks whether you want to receive notifications for content recommendations and other alerts. But from there, it’s much the same experience as on other platforms. Oddly, the Prime Video app itself can’t be made full-screen — but that changes as soon as you start playing a movie or TV show. Amazon is supporting native macOS features like picture-in-picture and AirPlay, and it’s also baked in its own extras like X-Ray with cast and behind-the-scenes info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5FNR"&gt;Aside from the regular free-with-Prime-subscription selection, there’s also a dedicated store tab where you can rent or purchase content. Amazon will use your account’s stored payment info when making charges. Other settings in the app include auto play and subtitle preferences, parental controls, and you can also view other devices that have been registered to your Prime account. Any deeper account management than that will require going to Amazon’s site in a browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93BTw0"&gt;From a functionality standpoint, most of what you’d want out of a Prime Video app is now on the Mac. That new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; makes for quite a portable movie-watching experience. Amazon’s Prime Video app for Mac is compatible with macOS Big Sur and later.&lt;/p&gt;
