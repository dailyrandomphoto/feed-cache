    <title>macOS Monterey is now available to download</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecyI9B"&gt;The latest version of macOS, Monterey, is now available to download &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/macos-monterey-is-now-available/"&gt;according to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The software has been available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;public beta for several months&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s release means Apple thinks the software is ready for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SrFaF"&gt;As is tradition, Apple announced its latest version of macOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;at WWDC in June&lt;/a&gt;. New features include the ability to set Macs as an AirPlay target to play content from iPhones and iPads, as well as Shortcuts, Apple’s iOS automation software. There have also been improvements made to FaceTime, as well as a new Quick Note feature. For a full rundown of what’s on the way, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;preview from July&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/"&gt;Apple’s own feature list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YQCoeJ"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-925" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s drag-and-drop demo from WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJgp8"&gt;Unfortunately, some of Monterey’s biggest new additions, Universal Control and SharePlay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;don’t seem to be available at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple notes that both features will be available “&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/#:~:text=available%20later%20this%20fall."&gt;later this fall.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82u2wM"&gt;Universal Control allows files to be dragged and dropped between several different machines, as Apple’s Craig Federighi demonstrated at WWDC.  It also will let you control multiple Apple devices including Macs, MacBooks, and iPads, with the same mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpzQJH"&gt;SharePlay will enable shared experiences of music, TV shows, movies, and more while connected over FaceTime. Once it’s available, Apple says you can use the feature with Apple Music, Apple TV+ and unnamed “popular third-party services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXqmr1"&gt;It’s better news when it comes to Safari’s redesign, which by default now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733357/apple-old-safari-tab-design-macos-monterey"&gt;uses a more traditional interface&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs"&gt;controversial new tab design&lt;/a&gt; introduced at WWDC. Early users complained that, among other things, the changes made it far too difficult to work out which tab was currently active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKBIgF"&gt;The full list of Macs that can run Monterey can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wVQfix"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="macCRY"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pe2aXs"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EwY30f"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="noB5Y1"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OB4NQq"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L42eNi"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx8cXp"&gt;For those keeping track, there are a couple of models that got Big Sur last year that have been left out of the Monterey party. These include the 2015 MacBook, the 2013 MacBook Air, the late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. Here’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201581"&gt;Apple’s guide&lt;/a&gt; for identifying your specific model, and here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21287898/apple-macos-updates-automatic-manage-software-catalina-apple-macbook"&gt;ours for updating your machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U4sHG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541"&gt;To install Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Software Update (or search “Software Update” in Spotlight). If Monterey shows up as an available install, you can then click the upgrade button to begin the install process. If it doesn’t show up, you may need to check back in later, as it continues to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWiS9p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 1:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on SharePlay and instructions for how to install Monterey. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.1 with SharePlay and more iPhone 13 Pro camera options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEJLYKONo8IiYe34FuX2ZXR85NI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042748/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C7o5Si"&gt;Apple is releasing iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 today, and the big new feature is SharePlay’s return. SharePlay is a feature that was originally supposed to ship in iOS 15; it lets people call friends or family and watch movies, TV, or listen to music together. SharePlay syncs content so everyone can watch it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARvL9R"&gt;iOS 15.1 also includes some improvements to the camera options for iPhone 13 Pro models. A new Auto Macro toggle for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is available, allowing you to switch off the automatic macro mode if you find it annoying. ProRes video capture is also available in iOS 15.1, so you can capture even better quality video on an iPhone 13 Pro at 30fps / 1080p on 128GB models or 4K on 256GB models and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAmXnN"&gt;Apple is also enabling iOS 15.1 users to add their COVID vaccine card to the Wallet app, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;Google’s Android version of this feature works&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a HomePod user, iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5D6xY"&gt;iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 are both available now from Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update on compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original iPod ‘prototype’ was an Apple design to prevent leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The original iPod prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2tVXxDlIa4vOZgRTnE3xcDgWeY=/0x44:2560x1751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042659/ipod_prototype_apple.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvaKCn"&gt;It’s hard to believe that the prototype for the original iPod is something that you can’t even fit into your pocket. Panic, a software development group for macOS and iOS, &lt;a href="https://panic.com/blog/a-prototype-original-ipod/"&gt;dredged up the prototype for the original iPod&lt;/a&gt; — something that Apple probably never wanted to see again — in honor of the iPod’s 20th anniversary (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/23/panic-shares-first-look-at-extremely-rare-early-ipod-prototype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPod prototype size comparison" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O80yYmcgu3tkdsDtXymlT97LbAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953923/ipod_prototype_size_comparison.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Panic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIoxH1"&gt;As funny as it would be if Apple was actually trying to make the iPod look like a failed attempt at a pocket-sized DVD player, that’s (sadly) not the case. A tweet from Tony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod, confirms that the prototype was designed to prevent the real iPod design from getting leaked ahead of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9M7rpp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a P68/Dulcimer iPod prototype we (very quickly) made before the true form factor design was ready. Didn’t want it look like an iPod for confidentiality - the buttons placement, the size - it was mostly air inside - and the wheel worked (poorly) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc"&gt;https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1451969239359926276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQFoZA"&gt;The yellow, brick-like device is dated September 3rd, 2001, almost two months before the iPod’s actual release date on October 23rd. The prototype is several times larger than the iPod we all know and love and has a scroll wheel in its top-left corner, along with a tiny screen in the top-right. Other clunky navigation buttons line the side of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhlY6x"&gt;Apple’s mission to conceal its design is also the reason behind the massive amount of space on the inside of the device. The layout of its internals is closer to the size of the official iPod, but Apple just decided to give it a clunky get-up to hide its design secrets, both on the inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGRNMX"&gt;We’ve seen other Apple prototypes in the past, but nothing looks as silly as this. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/25/14737526/second-generation-ipod-prototype-ebay"&gt;second-generation iPod popped up on eBay&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and the seller wanted nearly $100,000. Even &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/the-story-behind-a-rare-1st-generation-ipod-touch-prototype-that-still-runs-os-x-gallery/"&gt;the iPod Touch prototype&lt;/a&gt; looks close to the finished product. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738419/apple-videopad-auction-steve-jobs-bonhams-prototype"&gt;a prototype for the never-released VideoPad 2&lt;/a&gt; popped up and is set to be auctioned off in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4CMd3"&gt;The original iPod prototype, however, is definitely one of a kind. It’s a testament to Apple’s dedication to keeping its design classified, which was especially important for the launch of its very first iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max impressions: giving the people what they want</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new 16-inch MacBook Pro on a table" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9acDB7UuM65bB3mu_qfX0jB5azY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70041418/akrales_211020_4803_0201.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;New chips, familiar ports, and actual volume buttons — it might be love&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Tp6Am9"&gt;It’s easy to be excited about the new MacBook Pros — it feels like Apple finally listened to everyone and brought back the best parts of the beloved 2015 MacBook Pro, while pushing the display and performance to new heights. I know a lot of people who ordered one sight unseen; the pent-up demand for a great pro Mac laptop has been growing since Apple released the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1 chips last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD8mxt"&gt;We’ve had three of these new MacBook Pros for a little less than a week — we’re doing some quick impressions now, but we’re taking our time with the full review since there’s a lot to discuss and a lot of questions about performance and battery life to answer. We also know a lot of people are eager to order these new MacBook Pros but have a lot of questions, so ask away in the comments and we’ll answer as many as we can in the review later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrPGv8"&gt;The three MacBook Pro models we have here are a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1141873/1110072/7613?subId1=VergeMacBookPro102521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F16-inch-space-gray-10-core-cpu-32-core-gpu-1tb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver 16-inch model&lt;/a&gt; loaded with a 10-core M1 Max with a 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that sells for $3,899; a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1141873/1110072/7613?subId1=VergeMacBookPro102521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F16-inch-space-gray-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-1tb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver M1 Pro 16-inch&lt;/a&gt; with a 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that costs $3,099; and a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1141873/1110072/7613?subId1=VergeMacBookPro102521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F14-inch-space-gray-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-1tb%23" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray 14-inch&lt;/a&gt; with the same 10-core M1 Pro with 16-core GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage that sells for $2,899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MacBook Pro with lid closed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_iXIjN0X8_efpoUFEkERn-nzgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948088/akrales_211020_4803_0125.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Pro has a blocky, almost throwback design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GZGA5e"&gt;Design wise, they’re a slight new direction for Apple laptops — the concepts are all familiar, but the execution is a little more squared off, a little thicker, a little more aggressive. They share an overall sensibility with that 2015 MacBook Pro, with a hint of the titanium PowerBook G4 from 2001. The “MacBook Pro” name is now stamped on the bottom, along with four raised feet — there was some early discussion about these feet, but in practice they are barely noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bottom of new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4rfX3_HvG5vh4-JnPY9d6frWxGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948750/akrales_211022_4803_0237.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bottom plate has four rubber feet and an imprinted logo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Raised feed on the new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azef7GnjLA8RvDMX8QxW50VRbPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948748/akrales_211022_4803_0216.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rubber feet add some height to the MacBook Pro but aren’t really noticeably in use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd9VrS"&gt;In a welcome move, Apple has added some useful ports back to the new MacBook Pros: gaze upon an SD card slot and an HDMI port. (Sadly, neither is cutting edge, the SD slot is UHS-II, not UHS-III, and the HDMI is 2.0, not 2.1.) Other than that, you’ve got three Thunderbolt 4 ports and the MagSafe power connector. It’s great that MagSafe is back, but I get the feeling it’s a hedge against the confusing mess of USB-C power standards: you can charge the new Pros from any of the Thunderbolt 4 ports and fast charge the 14 over USB-C, but Apple tells us you can &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; fast charge the 16 with the MagSafe port. And we need to really test how fast charging works on the 16 with other USB-C adapters to make sure it works, since that’s always goofy. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HDMI and SD card slot on the new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1X9POwVTPMXhYn-nlK9pllXeQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948084/akrales_211020_4803_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports! Specifically, the SD card slot and HDMI have returned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MagSafe on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujyxxWJoNxzjk8Avjq9gbMkI6f8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948085/akrales_211020_4803_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also making its return is MagSafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHbq7D"&gt;The other major design change is a personal victory: Apple finally got rid of the Touch Bar, which never really lived up to its potential, and replaced it with full-height function keys. They’re great, uncomplicated, and do exactly what you’d expect. The TouchID button looks a lot uglier in photos, but it’s totally fine in person and seems very fast to unlock the machine. The keyboard feels great, although Apple’s claim that it feels like a mechanical keyboard is just like… an idea from another dimension? Here in reality, it feels like a nice laptop keyboard. The most controversial thing about it in our office has been the all-black keyboard deck, which some people think will get dirty fast. So far: it hasn’t been an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Keyboard on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6G6pEjjSkyhh6EFMI0KMtGRvnU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948082/akrales_211020_4803_0037.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Touch Bar is gone, thankfully, but the TouchID sensor helpfully remains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKkCjG"&gt;We’re going to spend a lot of time testing the new Mini LED display that supports 120Hz refresh rates in the full review, but in early use it looks great, with claimed peak brightness up to 1,600 nits in the default profile out of the box. One nice surprise, given Apple and Google’s history of weird video codec fights: you can just open up an HDR video on YouTube in Chrome and it will work and look incredible. It’s great. And yes, the display has a notch, which we know will be polarizing, but I very quickly stopped noticing it, just like everyone stops seeing the iPhone notch. We’ll see how I feel after another few days with this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Notch on new MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WFde5UyfBxFRamE7rmfu9q2Hv5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948752/pesposito_170722_4803_0032.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Phil Esposito / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new 1080p webcam is much better than the lousy cameras on prior MacBooks. Oh, yeah, there’s a notch now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CqEX4b"&gt;Inside the notch, there’s a new 1080p camera that takes advantage of Apple’s image processing system on its chips. It’s noticeably clearer and crisper than the miserable quality of previous Apple webcams, but it’s still a laptop webcam — it’s not even close to an iPhone front camera. And there’s no Center Stage, so it doesn’t follow you around the room on a video call like the iPad can now do. The sound quality on these machines is incredible — there are six speakers, and they sound great and support spatial audio. And they can get very loud. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ImQZO-LfXtOaLytMYjU77z_Kfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948083/akrales_211020_4803_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new keyboard is all black, which might get dirty over time. But so far, so good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g8RZnC"&gt;Inside you’ve got Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max processors, which are much more powerful versions of the M1 chip that have much more serious GPU capabilities. We’re doing a lot of performance tests to see what’s what with these chips, but I can tell you right now that the 16-inch Pro with M1 Max clocked the fastest time ever in our Adobe Premiere 4K export test… by over a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysoWiJ"&gt;Apple is very proud of the fact that its chips draw so much less power than the competition, so it’s able to deliver the same performance plugged in as on battery power. We’ll do our best to put that to the test. And a major reason we’re taking a little extra time to publish our full review is because I want to be really certain about battery life — we loved the battery life we got on the M1 machines last year, but these have much beefier chips, bigger, brighter displays, and get used for more intense tasks, so I want to be as sure about that as we can. The early results are promising — big batteries and efficient chips are a good combination — but we want to push things as hard as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7lS2nuRIO-lBuQiF7B8iOvIkXLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948078/akrales_211020_4803_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new MacBook Pro 16.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3dRpsY"&gt;But the main thing we want to know is: what do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to know about these new MacBook Pros? A lot of people have waited a long time for these machines, and we want to make sure we make this review as useful as we can. Let us know your questions in the comments and we’ll try to answer them in our full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Estimated ship times for preorders of new MacBook Pro models now into late November, early December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pn7Z7Arf77btJcEeUQ7rAn-J3ms=/25x0:1936x1274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70038151/Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_inch_Final_Cut_Pro_10182021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ship times for MacBook Pro models have slid into December&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMB2mj"&gt;Shipping estimates on the Apple Store for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro pre-orders have started sliding into late November and early December. As of Sunday morning, estimates for the standard configurations of the 14-inch MacBook Pro were showing delivery dates between November 16th and 23rd. Customizing a 14-inch Pro could push the estimated delivery into mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NDwe3"&gt;For the 16-inch MacBook Pro, standard configurations are showing estimated shipping times between November 23rd and December 1st, with customized options also showing mid-December ship dates depending what you choose. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple Online Store showing estimated shipping dates for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as of October 24th.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h-shipping-times-for-new-orders-continue-to-slip"&gt;Apple introduced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; MacBook Pro laptops at its “Unleashed” event on October 18th. The new design eliminates the Touch Bar in favor of a full-sized function row. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"&gt;added a notch&lt;/a&gt; to MacBook Pro screens for the first time, and brought back more port options, including an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="66KnO4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s ‘Unleashed’ Fall 2021 Mac Event: rumors, news, and announcements ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22725300/apple-event-unleashed-fall-2021-mac-mini-macbook-pro-news-announcements-products"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pCUuDh"&gt;We also get the return of the MagSafe charger with the new MacBook Pros, with Apple promising charging up to 50 percent within 30 minutes. The new laptops will also have Apple’s adaptive refresh rate technology ProMotion, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini-LED&lt;/a&gt; 120Hz refresh displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rVOk"&gt;The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, and the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4AaEZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple’s Mini LED MacBook Pros avoid the iPad Pro’s downsides?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8DNKAxG7r1CcuvHcMmvs48x_mw=/0x101:1496x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035215/0930B0A7_5370_4E42_AD2D_52450E957E8A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="plMltY"&gt;When Apple announced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I knew it was time to upgrade from my 2018 model. And I wasn’t disappointed. The improved brightness (especially when watching movies in HDR) and superior contrast have made the purchase worthwhile — even if iPadOS continues to underwhelm and disappoint in other ways. It’s a wonderful screen that makes me want to use the iPad wherever I can instead of my laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWtUtt"&gt;As a refresher of what Mini LED is, there are thousands of tiny LEDs behind the display — much smaller than those in conventional TVs or LCD displays — that allow for more precise backlighting. In turn, this leads to deeper black levels and all of the other benefits mentioned above. Apple’s iPads and MacBook already had excellent displays with accurate, wide color reproduction. But Mini LED takes their display quality to the next level. Add a smoother 120Hz refresh rate on top of that, plus all those glorious ports, and you can see why people are excited and these machines are already heavily backordered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OuBhmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tlPE7v"&gt;But at least with the iPad Pro, this transition to Mini LED didn’t come without any downsides. And with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros now adopting the same Pro Display XDR (Mini LED) technology, it’s worth tracking whether those same downsides have come along to Apple’s laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FzCI0"&gt;Dieter addressed one of the issues, blooming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly if you’re using the iPad Pro in a dark room, you’ll sometimes notice a halo of light around bright objects on screen when they’re surrounded by a black background. This is a tradeoff that’s inherent to full-array local dimming, and while it bothers some people, I’ve rarely found it annoying in my time using the iPad Pro. Either way, I think it’s occasionally worth dealing with for the  other gains you get in brightness and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjCQqB"&gt;Still, blooming might prove more frustrating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733173/macbook-pro-specced-out-high-end-price"&gt;a fully-loaded $6,000 laptop&lt;/a&gt; designed for professional editing work. I’m curious to see whether Apple has made any adjustments to diminish the issue on its new MacBook Pros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YK11u"&gt;The other downside of Apple’s Mini LED iPad Pro display is shadowing. As the new iPad made its way to buyers, people noticed &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252801469"&gt;a light shadow&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2021-12-9-screen-shadow.2297031/"&gt;runs along the very edges&lt;/a&gt; of the display. This shadow isn’t one of those things that’s present on some iPads and not others: it’s visible on every single M1 12.9-inch iPad Pro, because it has to do with how the Mini LED system is designed. Whereas most of the panel has superb uniformity, it falls off at the edges where the dimming zones trail off. Like blooming, this is something I don’t personally pay much attention to: my eyes are usually focused closer to the middle of the screen, where everything looks great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vklu2p"&gt;These edge shadows can also be seen on Apple’s premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; monitor. Overcast developer Marco Arment has described them as “the really big downside” of the display. Again, this is something that might be a bigger irritation on an expensive, marketed-at-pros laptop. Perhaps Apple has found a way to run the backlighting a little further beyond the bezels to avoid such an obvious falloff in brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgQ62r"&gt;The positives of the new MacBook Pro screens should easily outweigh the cons. They’re brighter and sharper than ever with the same eye-searing HDR highlights as the iPad Pro. But if you’re a sticker for the small things, it might be worth waiting until reviews are out to see if Apple has made improvements to its still-new display tech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQtrqlpNNUdjBoiPqyrrDQIFMS8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031940/Invasion_Photo_010202.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0cD52c"&gt;For a show about an alien invasion,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is decidedly lacking in aliens thus far. The latest sci-fi drama on Apple TV Plus, the series debuts with three episodes, which, theoretically, should give viewers a good sense of what to expect. Instead, those episodes oh-so-slowly introduce you to characters and stories without giving much of a hint as to how it all connects aside from the teaseist of teases. Three hours in, and I’m still not even sure what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYfhd0"&gt;The big hook of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s a global story. The idea is that you’ll be able to see the impact of this event from a bunch of different perspectives, and at the very least, it succeeds at that (albeit with the expected American-centric viewpoint). Over the first few episodes, you’re introduced to a sheriff in Oklahoma, a housewife in Long Island, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan, a teen in London, and an expert in Tokyo working with the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4v9II"&gt;And the show’s creators &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to know each of these individuals. The first three episodes are spent almost entirely on setting up their lives and circumstances. You’ll see a marriage slowly unravel (with some help from Find My iPhone, in one of the more obvious bits of product placement on Apple TV Plus) and watch a boy’s struggles with an almost pathological bully at school. I was particularly drawn into a secretive relationship between two women at the Japanese space agency that’s tragically cut short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bULNKY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2xFrbVNx0U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2oUYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LBsGJ"&gt;Many of these stories are interesting, even if they often delve into cliche; the sheriff, of course, is one day away from retirement before the invasion starts to happen. The problem is that the ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack. Across the first three hours, there are only hints of alien elements. There’s the usual like crop circles and fleeing animals, as well as some more unsettling moments like when an entire music class simultaneously gets a nosebleed. Eventually, things start crashing into the planet, causing havoc while TV news reports blame it on terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7X1WI"&gt;I’m all for a slow burn, but after three episodes, I should have some clearer sense of the titular&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;invasion. (Apple’s other big sci-fi drama, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, is similarly slow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;but at least it’s pretty to look at&lt;/a&gt;.) Here the pacing feels like it's stopping this invasion dead in its tracks. It's great meeting the characters and having a strong sense of their lives before aliens blow it up, but I am also here to see actual aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOc8VT"&gt;It’s entirely plausible that things pick up soon, and the sci-fi elements are actually interesting. We still have seven episodes to go. (New episodes will release every Friday, like most series on Apple.) But early on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; demands far too much of viewers, expecting them to stick around without giving much assurance of an eventual payoff. Please, just show me an alien already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your iPhone’s app icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOdBcTTheQdzuU1CVztawE8DbsE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446002/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CT8iXi"&gt;Have you ever wanted to make your iPhone your own, with your individualized style and flair? Sure, you can change your home screen wallpaper. But if you really want to personalize your phone, why not create your own app icons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4hFLk"&gt;It’s doable, using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the icons that the apps came with — rather, you’ll be creating separate shortcuts that lead to the app.   It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTqHfS"&gt;Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4A9Oyt"&gt;Before you begin, it’s a good idea to find an icon for your new shortcut. There are a bunch of icon sources online (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or if you’re artistic and / or ambitious, you can create your own. Whether you use someone else’s or your own, save the image to Photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4opbvA"&gt;Okay, let’s begin. Find and tap on the Shortcuts app. It’s pre-installed; if you can’t see it immediately on your home screen, swipe left until you’re at the App Library and start typing “Shortcuts” into the top search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA4Adi"&gt;Once you’re in the app, tap on the “plus” sign in the upper-right corner. Type the name of your new shortcut on top, and then tap on “Add Action”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shortcut can help you create new bookmarks for your apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmTDxfYPnlWBvy5ksFZwCCeVnMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653452/IMG_9007135DEFEF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcuts can help you create new bookmarks for your apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEijEWhSAHyFqJ9T5oqG4WvJ3vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945508/IMG_D954C140D41F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Rl4v05"&gt;There are a lot of interesting things to try out in Shortcuts. But right now, what we want to do is switch app icons. Type “Open app” in the search bar and then tap on the “Open App” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XCKRrg"&gt;Tap on the word “App” that appears (rather faintly) next to the word “Open.” You’ll see a list of your apps; pick the one you want to customize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zwuizA"&gt;Now, tap the blue symbol in the upper right corner. You’ll be taken back to your shortcut page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Type “Open app” in the search bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gevNxwMcl4ZoUkKfC_1rXQF0M9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945593/IMG_4F75405CF491_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type “Open app” in the search bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “App” to select which icon to replace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0yQJPUJfMIHPa974FkTA-jIKOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945595/IMG_22637E24C8DD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “App” to select which icon to replace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HzgHOz"&gt;Tap “Add to Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uuIAM1"&gt;You’ll now see a preview of the icon (which will be a standard, uninteresting icon that Shortcuts automatically adds). Don’t worry — we’re going to make it better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4diHVaFAan70_wVunFyFKyt1bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945896/IMG_5A159D409582_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At first, you get a generic icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpqlPJlBKnT0wSSeVIn8cNh2Rcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653474/IMG_5A5AAD54523D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qb7nmD"&gt;Tap on the icon under “Home Screen Name and Icon.” You’ll have the choice of either taking a photo, choosing a photo, or choosing a file. Assuming you’ve already saved an image in Photo, tap on “Choose Photo” and select the photo you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="udyrhq"&gt;If you’ve chosen an existing photo, a highlighted area will indicate what part of the photo will appear as an icon; you can move the photo around until you’re happy with the section indicated. Tap “Choose” in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVDuCP2oNtlJkjaJJkSN8j_CM7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653487/IMG_8F28F1423B8D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02fQSnoF4bW2iUtHgdeN-rswHUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653493/IMG_2A665EFE27F3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lCKV5y"&gt;Now, you’ll see your new icon. If you haven’t added a name for your new shortcut, you can still do it here by typing the name next to the icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK6ETB"&gt;All ready? Tap Add in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzDhp6"&gt;You should see your new customized icon on your home screen. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SBacWP"&gt;There’s the possibility you may see two new icons on your home screen: one with the first boring icon and one with your wonderful new icon. If that’s the case, just press and hold the icon that you don’t want, and then select “Delete bookmark.” Remember, this (and the other you created) is a bookmark / shortcut — not the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Voila! Your new icon is ready" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqDtwhDt2TrnFN05duszNvUc69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653500/IMG_0D46D384E161_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voila! Your new icon is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the original icon if you want" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wcXApwlRvi8PzqoYVUXlCHp7iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653502/IMG_141812774F53_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the original icon if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uMQx0K"&gt;You can also hide the original app icon so you’ll just have the new one visible. (You don’t want to delete it completely, of course; that would delete the app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4q02gy"&gt;Long-press on the original app icon and select “Edit Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ppj8h"&gt;Tap on the minus sign. On the pop-up menu, tap “Remove from Home Screen.” The original icon won’t be deleted, just hidden; you can always find it in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vs46q8"&gt;One note: when you use your new icon to go to the app, you will occasionally get a small drop-down notice that tells you what the original app is called and to remind you of the fact that it is a shortcut. But the drop-down will only last for a second or two, so it shouldn’t be much of a bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTLWzA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on Jun 13th, 2021; it has been updated to accommodate changes in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
