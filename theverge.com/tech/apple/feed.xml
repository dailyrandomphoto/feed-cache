    <title>Researchers produce collision in Apple’s child-abuse hashing system</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r0Ff7C"&gt;Researchers have produced a collision in iOS’s built-in hash function, raising new concerns about the integrity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s CSAM-scanning system&lt;/a&gt;. The flaw affects the hashing system, called NeuralHash, which allows Apple to check for exact matches of known child-abuse imagery without possessing any of the images or gleaning any information about non-matching pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiRbf8"&gt;On Tuesday, a GitHub user called Asuhariet Ygvar &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX"&gt;posted code for&lt;/a&gt; a reconstructed Python version of NeuralHash, which he claimed to have reverse-engineered from previous versions of iOS. The GitHub post also includes &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/blob/master/README.md"&gt;instructions on how to extract the NeuralMatch files from a current macOS or iOS build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll8Eho"&gt;“Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations,” Ygvar wrote on Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/p6hsoh/p_appleneuralhash2onnx_reverseengineered_apple/"&gt;sharing the new code&lt;/a&gt;. “Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it’s enabled on all iOS devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ivT4by"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Researchers produced a collision: two images that generate the same hash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnJOzI"&gt;Once the code was public, more significant attacks were quickly discovered. A user called Cory Cornelius &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/issues/1"&gt;produced a collision in the algorithm&lt;/a&gt;: two images that generate the same hash. If the findings hold up, it will be a significant failure in the cryptography underlying Apple’s new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEJxAu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;On August 5th&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new system for stopping child-abuse imagery on iOS devices. Under the new system, iOS will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;check locally stored files&lt;/a&gt; against hashes of child abuse imagery, as generated and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The system contains numerous privacy safeguards, limiting scans to iCloud photos and setting a threshold of as many as 30 matches found before an alert is generated. Still, privacy advocates remain concerned about the implications of scanning local storage for illegal material, and the new finding has heightened concerns about how the system could be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGnChB"&gt;While the collision is significant, it would require extraordinary efforts to exploit it in practice. Generally, collision attacks allow researchers to find identical inputs that produce the same hash. In Apple’s system, this would mean generating an image that sets off the CSAM alerts even though it is not a CSAM image, since it produces the same hash as an image in the database. But actually generating that alert would require access to the NCMEC hash database, generating more than 30 colliding images, and then smuggling all of them onto the target’s phone. Even then, it would only generate an alert to Apple and NCMEC, which would easily identify the images as false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2R87I"&gt;Still, it’s an embarrassing flaw that will only elevate criticism of the new reporting system. A proof-of-concept collision is often disastrous for crytographic hashes, as in the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14712118/google-sha1-collision-broken-web-encryption-shattered"&gt;the SHA-1 collision in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, although perceptual hashes like NeuralHash are known to be more collision-prone. As a result, it’s unclear whether Apple will replace the algorithm in response to the finding, or make more measured changes to mitigate potential attacks. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XNcpf"&gt;More broadly, the finding will likely heighten calls for Apple to abandon its plans for on-device scans, which have continued to escalate in the weeks following the announcement. On Tuesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-apple-don-t-scan-our-phones"&gt;launched a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on Apple to drop the system, under the title “Tell Apple: Don’t Scan Our Phones.” As of press time, it has garnered more than 1,700 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSftcK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10:53AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and copy to more accurately reflect known weaknesses of perceptual hash systems in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZU538"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, the five-versus-five MOBA game that released in July for the Nintendo Switch, will debut on iOS and Android devices on September 22nd. The Pokémon Company shared today during a livestream that you can pre-register for the mobile game now on your respective devices (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be notified when it’s officially available to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJqIX3"&gt;Whether you play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile or a Nintendo Switch, the game will offer cross-platform play to broaden who you can play alongside or against. By linking your account on both the Switch version and the mobile game, you’ll be able to have cross-progression, which will allow you to play the game with your saved data and characters on whichever device is more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS 15 beta fixes the Safari address bar and lets you move it back to the top</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQiZaXf28tT68EDKnF3rm01iCgY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738014/acastro_200207_3900_Safari_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tq7nN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes"&gt;Apple has updated Safari’s design&lt;/a&gt; in the latest iOS 15 beta (Developer Beta 6), making the address bar look and act more like what users are used to and giving you the option to put it at either the top or bottom of the screen. Safari’s redesign, especially on iPhones, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;been controversial&lt;/a&gt; since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Apple is starting to walk back the floating design that’s persisted throughout the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj0QLp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; founder and podcaster Federico Viticci has posted screenshots of the new design on Twitter, showing off the changes. If the user chooses to have the address bar on the bottom, it sits above a row of controls, including back and forward buttons, a share button, and the tab button. (In previous versions of the beta, these buttons were one with the address bar.) If the user chooses the option to have the address bar at the top, Safari will look similar to how it did in iOS 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wNWNe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We did it everyone:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safari in iOS 15 beta 6 features a new address bar at the bottom that sits below page content. A toolbar with buttons is back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we can put the address bar back at the top again   &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbCvauXoDy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dbCvauXoDy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427683610031702017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzlfWB214q6IXC-JQKxypW0vLhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788122/IMG_2284.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comparison, this is Safari’s UI in the previous beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjLV0"&gt;Apple has been tweaking and changing Safari’s new design since it made its debut in the first beta. The updates have been relatively small — buttons were added back into the address bar (making it a minefield of touch targets), and Apple &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qtUKzWab71Q?t=256"&gt;made the address bar easier to get to when you’re typing in a URL or search term&lt;/a&gt;. However, the incremental updates haven’t appeased those calling for a return to a more traditional design, one that doesn’t include a floating element that hovers above a webpage’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SaYo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Options should help please those who (kind of) liked the change, and those who didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRKvPp"&gt;The option to change where the address bar resides should please those who thought its new place at the bottom was a good one (regardless of how its actual design was executed), as well as those who prefer to have it at the top. It may make things tough for web designers, who will have to deal with the possibility of something butting up against either the top or bottom of their webpage, but it’s a nice option for users to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCHIpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427685686849769472?s=20"&gt;According to Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad version of Safari hasn’t changed with this update, though Apple introduced an option that more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;let you go back to a traditional design&lt;/a&gt; in Beta 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says SharePlay won’t be part of initial iOS 15 release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV1QOYraAdCGnrD9LKF3x-VKrc=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69737506/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCkPhu"&gt;One of iOS 15’s marquee new features, SharePlay, has been delayed and now won’t be rolled out until after the major update is released this fall. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/"&gt;Apple has informed developers&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will be disabled in the next betas of iOS 15, iPadOS15, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. SharePlay allows people to enjoy entertainment (TV shows, movies, music, etc.) together at the same time and syncs everything up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlzp23"&gt;The company has confirmed that this feature will be absent in the official release of iOS 15 when it widely rolls out in the fall. Apple now says that SharePlay will return “in future developer beta releases and will launch to the public in software updates later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOg5i"&gt;“We’re thrilled with the high level of enthusiasm we’ve seen from the developer community for SharePlay, and we can’t wait to bring it to users so that they can experience your apps with their friends and family in a whole new way,” Apple said in its update to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4G10w"&gt;This is the first major new aspect of iOS 15 to be pulled back from the launch release, but it will undoubtedly raise questions about which other features might also have to wait for a later update. Apple has yet to include Universal Control, one of the most impressive tricks it showed off at WWDC, in any of this summer’s beta releases. Universal Control will allow iPad and Mac owners to work seamlessly across both products with the same keyboard and mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLdpC"&gt;Apple has held back some of its promised features from previous major iOS releases until they were more polished and ready to go. As just one example, Group FaceTime was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684154/apple-group-facetime-chats-delay-ios-12"&gt;delayed from the initial release of iOS 12&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 until a smaller update that rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18040034/apple-ios-12-1-release-date-october-30-features-group-facetime-beautygate"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUAdXX"&gt;Check out our preview of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; for a rundown of all the new features that Apple says will be available — at some point, anyway — later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 lets you disable Night Mode on an iPhone camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TlXBOjKEaOboAxMYZ40sA89hSJg=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69735920/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L6fsti"&gt;Apple is introducing an option to fully disable Night Mode on an iPhone camera in iOS 15. While you’ve always been able to turn off Night Mode for a particular shot, the iPhone camera will also re-enable it the next time it detects it needs to be used. In iOS 15, you can now toggle whether the camera remembers Night Mode has been turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0z4jr"&gt;Night Mode is often a useful way to capture great photos in low light, but occasionally there are times when an iPhone enables this mode and you end up with a photo that’s worse with Night Mode enabled. If you’re someone who prefers to have full control over their iPhone camera, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/16/ios-15-lets-you-turn-off-iphone-cameras-night-mode-feature-and-keep-it-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that you can effectively disable Night Mode in iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KgPzsh"&gt;Go to settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="75owq7"&gt;Pick camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qLUboh"&gt;Pick preserver settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2EcnVo"&gt;Toggle the Night Mode setting to &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="BfOQM3"&gt;This will allow your iPhone camera to keep Night Mode off if you disable it for a shot. You can still toggle Night Mode back on if you need it, but it’s now you making a decision to enable it rather than the iPhone itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmNlwE"&gt;This isn’t the only improvement to the camera in iOS 15. Apple is also making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610190/ios-15-beta-4-green-lens-flare-photos-processing-computation"&gt;subtle improvements to photos&lt;/a&gt; by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor photos. Both of these improvements are available in the latest public iOS 15 betas and should appear for iPhone users once iOS 15 ships (probably next month).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TYePA"&gt;Adobe &lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.adobe.com%2Fen%2Fpublish%2F2021%2F08%2F17%2Fphotoshop-releases-major-update-sky-replacement-healing-brush-magic-wand-on-ipad-much-more.html&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7CClaire.Petras%40edelman.com%7C520c8c50266b4d2c65b108d95c54c84c%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637642341490258971%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=DYYzDpKycoCiC4gpknFJ5BiuscrYAKdXfRqSTpcHNsw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;has announced it’s updating Photoshop on iPad&lt;/a&gt; today with a classic desktop tool missing from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20937111/adobe-photoshop-ipad-now-available-download-cloud-psd-workflow"&gt;the original launch of the app&lt;/a&gt; — the Magic Wand. Some of the intelligent selection features from Magic Wand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/20806997/adobe-photoshop-for-ipad-update-select-subject-tool"&gt;have been introduced to the iPad app in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but now Adobe is adding the tool itself, making it easier to select, adjust, or remove specific elements of a larger project with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHIm65"&gt;The Magic Wand tool on iPad should be familiar to anyone who’s used it on desktop. The tool makes it easy to extract objects from a flat background, select oddly shaped areas, or select a specific colored section of a project to then transform in the usual Photoshop ways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5T8kIx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Magic Wand makes selecting things easier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XkMCik"&gt;Adobe is also introducing a new way to share and project what you’re working on to larger screens with Canvas Projection. The plan is that by enabling Canvas Projection and connecting an iPad to an external display with USB-C or HDMI, you can display your project in full-screen, without Photoshop’s UI in the way. iPads can already connect to external displays (its even simpler on an iPad Pro with a USB-C port), but Photoshop’s feature should make it easier to share just what you're actually working on, without distracting menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/br5mjGLuyVVteELm3ltpMQchiyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786673/Transform_Warp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Transform Warp tool in desktop Photoshop is getting independent Bezier handles to adjust curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gszN7e"&gt;The desktop version of Photoshop is also getting a couple new additions: even more skies to use with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYq7XOIKWWM&amp;amp;list=PLXw7EK7EUaUEJJvW6cN4roebMHv0mWDaA&amp;amp;index=9"&gt;Sky Replacement tool&lt;/a&gt; under a new “Get More Skies” option, and an improved Transform Warp tool with “independent Bezier handles.” Adobe says the new handles should make it even easier to adjust images wrapped around unusual shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODMJiN"&gt;While the improved Transform Warp and Sky Replacement tools are exciting, it’s the iPad improvements that may leave users the most thrilled. Adobe has been promising something like a full version of Photoshop for iPad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17969754/adobe-photoshop-apple-ipad-creative-cloud"&gt;since at least 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s always been some kind of caveat. With the recent addition of &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/whats-new/mobile-2021-6.html"&gt;a fully powered Healing Brush&lt;/a&gt;, plus this launch of the Magic Wand tool, the iPad version of Photoshop is finally starting to look more like the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the latest and greatest Samsung and Apple earbuds lock you into their world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HefXsWVG753LiuDNXZwarCszYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733468/IMG_1106_Edited_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The recently-announced Galaxy Buds 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jawll"&gt;People always look at me weirdly when I say that I use Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; with my iPhone 12 Pro. But it’s a pairing that makes sense for me: First, I need something that sits entirely within my ear, without a stem that’s going to risk being knocked about by a bike helmet’s strap. Second, they work with Samsung’s companion Galaxy Buds app on iOS, so I can still access their advanced features. And third? I just love that they’re shaped like little kidney beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN0gX0"&gt;But if you were to try the same thing with Samsung’s newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt; Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find Samsung’s iOS earbud companion app hasn’t been updated to support them. Samsung wants you to buy a Samsung phone, so it appears to be locking you out of numerous little features, much like how Apple’s AirPods Pro are similarly restricted if you try to use them with an Android phone, or how OnePlus’ earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445641/oneplus-buds-standalone-app-android-phones"&gt;were missing key features when used with non-OnePlus Android devices&lt;/a&gt; at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAZ1Yk"&gt;While I can happily use the iOS companion app to tweak and update last year’s Buds Live, the same app won’t be able to recognize Samsung’s latest buds. If you’re an iPhone user, it’s an annoying enough situation that it feels like Samsung isn’t interested in your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP8Xh3"&gt;But how bad is the ecosystem lock-in with Apple and Samsung’s latest earbuds really? Here are the specific ways you’ll miss out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JEv4OF"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2’s ecosystem lock-in versus AirPods Pro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ayrNuH"&gt;Before we get into the details, here’s a chart showing which features you get with the AirPods Pro and Galaxy Buds 2, depending on whether you use the earbuds with iOS or Android: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLOEmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10703823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JRPBf"&gt;The good news is that basic functionality, like being able to listen to music and access playback controls from the buds themselves, is available regardless of whether you use the earbuds on iOS or Android. So too can you control features like noise-cancellation and transparency (aka ambient) modes, which aim to block out and let in outside noise, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWIJOZ"&gt;But lacking a companion app or native operating system support means you simply can’t access certain earbuds’ features if you’re not using the earbuds on their own platform. Most AirPods Pro controls are built directly into iOS, for example, while Samsung’s Galaxy Buds companion app doesn’t support its recent true wireless earbuds on iOS. That means you’re out of luck if you want to update either earbuds’ firmware on a competing operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQgz4m"&gt;These are the kinds of features that you could grow to miss in the long term, especially if you ever need to troubleshoot any problems. If your earbuds encounter a bug, there’s no chance of getting updated firmware to fix it if you’re on Android. Or if you suspect that your AirPods Pro’s battery is draining too quickly while listening to music on an Android phone, you don’t have an official battery indicator to troubleshoot what’s going wrong (although iOS’s system-level battery indicators mean this isn’t a problem for iPhones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esT1Pz"&gt;In some cases there are third-party apps designed to fill in the blanks. For example, the Android apps &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotarrow.assistantTrigger"&gt;Assistant Trigger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pro.vitalii.andropods&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;AndroPods&lt;/a&gt; promise to show your AirPods battery life and allow you to access your phone’s voice assistant such as Google Assistant with a squeeze or tap of the AirPods’ stem. But user reviews of both apps are mixed, and they’re clearly no replacement for official native support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GvE4V_5ezL8yYRQFDA0uPj1WyN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21700189/IMG_0628_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The beans offer iOS app sport, why not newer earbuds? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QqURmv"&gt;It’s also technically possible to use a tap-and-hold gesture to activate Siri when using Samsung’s Galaxy Buds with an iPhone. But in order to do so you have to customize the earbuds’ gesture controls, which default to activating noise-canceling and ambient modes. And customizing those controls relies on a companion app that doesn’t exist on iOS. It restricts easy access to a feature that, depending on your needs, you might rely on every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7O0yF"&gt;Apple and Samsung’s ability to lock you into an ecosystem extends to features that aren’t directly comparable as well. First is that the AirPods’ ability to automatically switch between audio sources only works on Apple devices like iPhones and iPads. It’s not able to automatically switch between an iPad and an Android phone, for example. Samsung’s Buds 2 don’t have a comparable feature, although the company included a version of it on the Buds Pro where it could automatically switch between Samsung phones and Samsung tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSsLSt"&gt;Next, both Apple and Samsung technically have features that let you find their respective earbuds using an app, but they’re very different. Apple’s is called “Find My” and currently it can show you where you might have left your AirPods on a map, based on the last time they were connected to your own phone. With iOS 15 this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;functionality is expanding&lt;/a&gt; by tapping into Apple’s Find My network, meaning other people’s Apple devices will also be able to report the location of your headphones. Either way, the feature is technically cross-platform since it’s accessible via a browser, even on Android. Samsung doesn’t have any of this map-based functionality, although like Apple its companion app includes a simpler option to have your earbuds play a sound to help you find them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3dA6vq"&gt;There are also differences in how the earbuds handle pairing. On iPhone, simply opening an AirPods case near your phone is enough to get the pairing process started. But even when you’re on a Samsung phone you have to head into its companion app before you start the official pairing process. Google has its own version of the AirPods’ pairing process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/31/16584442/fast-pair-android-easy-simple-bluetooth-pairing"&gt;called Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet to become ubiquitous almost four years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNKQVa"&gt;None of these missing features will fundamentally stop you from using either pair of earbuds to listen to music on the “wrong” platform. But it’s a hassle to have to hunt the Play Store for unofficial third-party apps to unlock basic functionality, or borrow a friend’s phone just to do a firmware update. Especially when you know you can avoid these problems with a different pair of earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bTLSH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Looks easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWsiKh"&gt;And that might be what Apple and Samsung are banking on: if they can convince you to pair their earbuds with their smartphones in blissful harmony, then they know they’ve given you one more reason to stick around in their ecosystem. Yes, it’s easy to replace that outdated iPhone with an Android by itself, but then your AirPods, and maybe even your Apple Watch, and HomePod all won’t work as well. In the end, it makes it look easier and easier to stick around in iPhone land. Sure, Apple might sell a few thousand more AirPods if they worked better on Android, but at the risk of losing much-costlier iPhone sales. It might be why Samsung recently revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui"&gt;its new flagship Google watch won’t work with the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAPT4f"&gt;In portable audio land, it all means that, unless you have a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;strong preference for Apple or Samsung’s earbuds, you’ll get a more complete experience with less hassle by pairing like with like. You can fight ecosystem lock-in all you want, but sometimes it’s just easier to go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcmKfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHmCZn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows users can now manage their iCloud Passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aH7ddqUMVde7u-tV2OpUm4KrLDQ=/0x0:860x573/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733156/2021_08_16_11_16_34_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN9avk"&gt;If you sync your iCloud Passwords with Windows, Apple’s new, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;dedicated iCloud Passwords app&lt;/a&gt; is going to give you some much-needed new abilities. The app, which comes with the iCloud for Windows 12.5 update, lets you search through your saved passwords, update them, add new ones, and delete login info you no longer want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTE5xN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to manage your iCloud Passwords using the new app, but it’s relatively straightforward. You can access the app from the Start menu, and make any changes to your passwords that you need. Those changes will then be synced to your Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dwpODws0adrDZaDAVXCNNKrA-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786016/2021_08_16_11_18_47_iCloud_Passwords.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Passwords running on Windows 10 (note that all data included in screenshots is example data). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NIyX9i"&gt;Apple rolled out some support for iCloud Passwords on Windows earlier this year. In January, an iCloud for Windows update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;added support for a Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; that would let you use the passwords already in your iCloud Keychain, as well as add new ones to your keychain from Chrome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;That extension&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263118/apple-icloud-windows-password-sync-version-removed"&gt;a very rocky rollout&lt;/a&gt;, but it eventually became available to users in a somewhat working state. It’s still part of iCloud for Windows 12.5’s password management system, and the 12.5 update brings support for an Edge version of the extension as well (in theory, Chrome extensions work with Edge, but &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj?hl=en"&gt;reviews on the Chrome web store&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this wasn’t the case for iCloud Passwords). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cinlsh7quWa9LdhYGMmxPZseqW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785982/2021_08_16_11_20_37_Login_on_Twitter___Twitter.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chrome extension lets you use passwords saved in your iCloud Passwords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hfRvka"&gt;This update makes using iCloud to sync your passwords significantly more viable if you’re someone who jumps between Windows and Mac (or who uses Windows and an iPhone). Being able to see and search through a list of your saved passwords gives you more flexibility than the browser extension, and being able to manage your passwords means that you don’t have to jump to an Apple device if you want to make changes to your logins. While the new app isn’t as fully featured as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt; (or, indeed, as Keychain Access on Mac), it’s certainly better than the little-to-no management abilities Windows users had before for their iCloud Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNDC1N"&gt;The 12.5 update for iCloud for Windows is available now, and you can get it by going to the Windows Store and searching for updates. If you don’t already &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/set-up-icloud-passwords-icw2babf5e03/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;have iCloud Password syncing set up on your Windows machine&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to enable it in iCloud Settings before you can use the password manager, but the process is relatively simple. Doing so requires an Apple account that uses two-factor authentication, along with an Apple device running iOS 14 / macOS 11 or later, which you’ll need to get the security code. You’ll also have to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0#ID0EBD=Windows_10"&gt;have Windows Hello set up&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t worry if your computer doesn’t have biometric authentication, because you can also use a PIN. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Apple rejections, FlickType gives up on popular iPhone keyboard for the blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehPF9Mv6r-SkJs0p-Rf_L-oS06g=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733034/flicktype_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Upup9"&gt;If you’re a blind or low-vision iPhone user who relies on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719"&gt;the FlickType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to type, I’ve got some bad news — you’re about to become a casualty of the fight between Apple and one of its staunchest critics. Developer Kosta Eleftheriou has announced that he’s discontinuing the iPhone keyboard portion of his app, and says that keyboard will automatically be removed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZuEIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52ZqXA"&gt;You might have heard the entire app is going away, and that’s not actually true, Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;In January 2020, he added a swipe-to-type Apple Watch keyboard to FlickType that saw the app skyrocket to the number one paid app in the entire Apple App Store for a time, and that app will continue to exist and continue to contain that Apple Watch keyboard.  Eleftheriou says the app has nearly half a million downloads, but he doesn’t have a breakdown for how many of those users rely on the iPhone keyboard specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The screenshot says “please enable full access for FlickType under the iOS Settings app.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNV7oi5-nRWEhBwZwSWfE_mixVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786073/13_twS_I.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple provided Eleftheriou with this screenshot “proving” the app doesn’t work without access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXfm4m"&gt;If his name sounds familiar, that’s because Eleftheriou is the same developer who’s been poking holes in Apple’s App Store image for months, pointing out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how egregious scams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;secret gambling dens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;review fraud&lt;/a&gt; keep making it through the company’s filters even though they’re pretty easy for anyone to root out. His fight became personal long before today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he sued Apple in March&lt;/a&gt; for some seemingly shady behavior, alleging that Apple erected roadblocks to his FlickType keyboard in order to convince him to sell the technology to Apple for a discount, all while scammy mobile keyboard apps flourished on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfBxvV"&gt;Now, says Eleftheriou, Apple has suddenly decided to reject FlickType yet again — and for a reason that he’s already successfully argued with them in the past. He shared the rejection letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty simple dispute: Apple says the keyboard needs to work even if a user doesn’t give it “full access” to network access and other iOS features. But Eleftheriou says that if Apple actually tried to use the app, or consulted their earlier discussions, they’d see that the keyboard works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N9YGH5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried reaching out to Apple a total of 9 times last week, with no success. At this point they seem to be ignoring our attempts to contact them directly, despite previously explicitly telling us to "feel free" to contact them if we need "further clarification".&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292841676398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyvCH"&gt;To be clear, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html"&gt;own developer guidelines specify&lt;/a&gt; that “full access” isn’t a problem: the only dispute here is whether the app continues to work if a user turns it off — which it does, says Eleftheriou, if you turn VoiceOver on. “They’d have to try it as a VoiceOver user, something that they don’t seem to bother doing. I’ve had several rejections in the past because the reviewer didn’t know anything about VoiceOver,” Eleftheriou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KuUMt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292843928821765"&gt;As his Twitter thread explains&lt;/a&gt;, Eleftheriou sees this as the final straw for this specific feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEntkf"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nE4HhJ"&gt;Eleftheriou stops short of accusing Apple of retaliation, in a separate chat over Twitter DM. “I can only speculate about this rejection, but I’ve recently had many more rejections I haven’t talked about yet, and them ignoring my attempts to reach them is also new,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg4tQe"&gt;“I can’t really know, but definitely feels like some kind of ‘special’ treatment going on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnhdju"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local and anonymous social media app Yik Yak is back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BQsWfGP4HEdBIJluaFa0viqaFo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732537/YikYakApp_2021_Aug_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knVMtm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/"&gt;Yik Yak&lt;/a&gt; — the anonymous, local social media app that only shows posts from people in your immediate area — has &lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back"&gt;returned from the grave&lt;/a&gt; with new ownership after shutting down four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5ryfF"&gt;According to the app’s relaunched website, the new incarnation of Yik Yak bought the rights to redevelop the service in February 2021, with the aim of providing a local social media network that’s free from the “labels” that dominate communication on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMk0hp"&gt;The new app resembles the original version of Yik Yak from 2014: users can post and comment on short text posts that are only able to be viewed within a five-mile radius. Like Reddit, posts can be upvoted and downvoted, and a separate “hot” feed compiles the top post from the past 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVnUx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  ICYMI: After a 4 year hiatus, Yik Yak is available in the App Store again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Anonymity, location-based, the hot feed &amp;amp; more — everything you used to love about Yik Yak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now available on iPhone in the US — more countries and devices coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV"&gt;https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HUAKh4elcA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HUAKh4elcA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7OIAS"&gt;Originally launched in late 2013, the app was a flash-in-the-pan success (particularly at college campuses) for most of 2014, when it was valued at $400 million by investors. But while the anonymity made it popular for college students, Yik Yak also was rife with bullying and harassment. In early 2016, in an effort to get things back on track, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/8/11175886/yik-yak-handles-usernames"&gt;Yik Yak added optional social media handles&lt;/a&gt;, which were made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12492152/yik-yak-redesign-local-yakkers-status-updates"&gt;mandatory in August&lt;/a&gt; of that year, effectively removing what had made the service unique. The original incarnation of Yik Yak ended up shutting down in early 2017, when it was sold for $1 million to Square for its engineering talent and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYUghr"&gt;The new Yik Yak looks to be taking a serious stance on bullying and harassment on its platform, though — something that the original incarnation of the app failed to do. The new owners have posted an extensive list of its “&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/community-guardrails"&gt;community guardrails&lt;/a&gt;,” which include prohibiting sharing of personal information, “anything that could be construed as bullying, abuse, defamation, harassment, stalking, or targeted hate or public humiliation,” and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvctrq"&gt;The company also notes that bullying, hate speech, threats, or other violations of any the community guardrails or terms of service can lead to an immediate ban from the platform. And posts that receive a total score of -5 will be hidden from view, too, to ensure that negative or harmful content isn’t surfaced further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub5lhG"&gt;The new Yik Yak is currently only available to download on iOS for users in the US, but the developers are promising to expand to more countries and devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;
