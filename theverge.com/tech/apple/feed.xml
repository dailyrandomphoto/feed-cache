    <title>Apple finally supports Windows Precision Touchpad gestures in new Boot Camp update</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wOOYiW"&gt;Apple is finally adding support for Windows Precision Touchpad drivers in its latest Boot Camp update. The new 6.1.15 update includes support for Windows Precision Touchpad, including single tap to click, lower-right corner to right-click, down motion to scroll up, and three or four finger gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo8U2R"&gt;Various &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/nx558h/apple_finally_adds_support_for_windows_precision/"&gt;Reddit users noticed&lt;/a&gt; the surprise update went live yesterday, and it apparently works better than third-party solutions like Trackpad++ and mac-precision-touchpad that people have had to use for years. “Works way better than both of them with better palm and thumb detection too,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bootcamp/comments/nwva18/boot_camp_6115_released_adds_support_for_windows/"&gt;says one Reddit user&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nRyEZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft started supporting Precision Touchpads more than seven years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGDR"&gt;Microsoft first started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/3/4489692/windows-8-1-precision-touchpad-support-intel-synaptics"&gt;introducing Windows Precision Touchpad&lt;/a&gt; with Intel in 2013, in an effort to fix what were notorious PC trackpad issues at the time. It has taken Apple a long time to enable Windows Precision Touchpad in Boot Camp, but not every MacBook is supported. An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/bootcamp-control-panel/bcmpa82153f3/mac"&gt;Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; notes that only Mac computers with a T2 chip will be able to access Windows Precision Touchpad, which is most MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models from 2018 onward (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eeo71j"&gt;The timing of such a significant update to Boot Camp is also surprising and could hint that Intel-based Macs will coexist with Apple’s M1-based Macs for a while yet. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559003/apple-mac-macbook-air-pro-mini-m1-intel-processor-cpu"&gt;discontinued Intel-based MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; last year, but you can still buy a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel CPU for now. Apple has said that its “transition to Apple silicon will take about two years to complete.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a letter envelope with a target over it with pixels floating around both." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Pi8r0uc4i8-kswTyRNU-H0pTaQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/VRG_4614_3_EmailTracking.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like Mailchimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded in the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images in Gmail through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple, basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images, since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to disable image autoloading in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Gmail on the web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper-right corner to access your settings, and then click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OyvGIew6m_cCzL7vC_d31z8230c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544004/gmail_pixel.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Images” and select “Ask before displaying external images.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Microsoft Outlook.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xDoAal"&gt;While the browser-based version of Outlook doesn’t let you stop loading images, you can make it load images through its own service. To enable that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CurYRn"&gt;Click on “Settings” (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner). In the column that opens, click on “View all Outlook settings” at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exNksS"&gt;Select “General” &amp;gt; “Privacy and data.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oQoFLs"&gt;Scroll down to “External images” and select “Always use the Outlook service to load images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JWz2g79d9AWZqgrg2XZ_vorNPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544343/outlook_online__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outlook.com can route incoming images through its own service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GlQKBG"&gt;Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) for Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML email messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item, if you like, by reviewing the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To stop automatic downloads, go to the Trust Center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qvp5woUtECVNQ68MfnG_uWpguBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545835/outlook_screenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To stop automatic downloads, go to the Trust Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uyuAUz"&gt;Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qY4VZ5"&gt;Go to “File” &amp;gt; “Preferences” &amp;gt; “Reading.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HromHN"&gt;You can choose to automatically download images only from trusted contacts, or to disable all automatic downloads of images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outlook for Mac lets you download images only from contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UXcH8c61nuzOq35QLJTruuaS1ZE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22545842/Screen_Shot_2021_05_28_at_10.05.20_AM.png"&gt;

&lt;h3 id="M1JF9m"&gt;Apple Mail for iOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="w1Qtvj"&gt;Another option is to use an email client such as &lt;a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks remote images by default; the application allows you to download embedded content on an individual basis, or to allow pictures from contacts that you trust not to send hidden code in their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06msoO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 2019, 3:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include additional information about email clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbvWNJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 3rd, 2019, 7:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include directions for disabling image autoloading on Gmail for iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Bwbn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 2021, 5:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Microsoft Mail have been removed, and a few instructions have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGMbOs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 11th, 2021, 8:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Outlook.com and Outlook for Mac have been added, and a few other instructions have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 gives you better tools to fight the firehose of notifications — with a catch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuCoVA7ssG0Z3TCAXxJ7Soj_i0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438771/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfUox1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week gave us a look at an important new feature coming to your iPhone’s notifications: help. A few new tools may act as a life preserver for those of us up to our eyeballs in a sea of notifications every day, regulating which apps and people are allowed to bug us, and when. But on the flip side, app developers get some additional tools for getting your attention, too, and could very well start sending you even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;notifications — albeit in a less disruptive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LI7bZA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10601863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwzC2c"&gt;First, the good news: the new notification features in iOS 15 look genuinely good and useful. There’s a new feature called Focus that allows you to choose which people and apps you’d like to see notifications from at a given time. It’s like Do Not Disturb but with much more customization than simply turning off every possible disruption. You can set up modes for work, sleep, personal time, and other scenarios like workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i13_lA5OsvFV8CNunF44yImFsvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651209/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_12.53.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People who message you in third-party apps can be associated with their profile in your contacts list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zZv4cm"&gt;When setting up a new Focus mode, Siri can scan your outgoing messages and calls and automatically suggest allowing notifications from the people you talk to most. There’s a neat trick here too: communications from the people you approve can come from other apps, like Facebook Messenger, not just from iMessage or texts. When you get that Facebook Messenger message in iOS 15, you may see prompts to associate that person in that app with a matching person in your contacts list, too. Once you’ve done this, communications from that person in a third-party app will be allowed to interrupt your Focus mode, provided that you approved them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSS4Kr"&gt;You’ll also have the option to set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524031/apple-focus-away-message-aim-wwdc-aol"&gt;a kind of away message&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using a Focus mode that will let others know you’re temporarily unavailable when they send you an iMessage. When your friend doesn’t hear back from you for hours, they won’t have to guess whether you hate them or you’re just really busy with work, and that’s nice for everyone. iOS 15 also adds notification summaries, which will batch lower priority notifications into digests you’ll receive at certain times of day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PgZKCDdDimtOWb1gdIt3zWT6AA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652212/notification_summary_ios_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notification summaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl0sTv"&gt;All of this gives you more control over interruptions, which is great! But what about app developers who want you to ~engage~ with their platform? They have new options too. They can now use one of four notification interruption types, two of which are new in iOS 15. First are passive interruptions, a new, less obtrusive kind of notification available to developers that doesn’t wake your screen or cause your phone to vibrate — they go straight to your notification center. Previous versions of iOS allowed the user to designate notifications from certain apps to be delivered silently, but this new framework lets the app developer choose to deliver them this way. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0u0PzzhdQyA4vW8XJnDCG7vf8Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22651200/passive_int.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Notifications classified as “passive” appear in your notification center silently, without buzzing your phone or breaking through a Focus mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv5hsy"&gt;These are the types of notifications likely to end up in summaries if you’ve enabled that feature. They don’t just appear in chronological order in the summary digest either — machine learning helps sort them by priority. They’ll likely include images and other visuals too, since Apple encourages developers to include media as part of the notification to increase its chances of showing up at the top of the summary list. And since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications. They’ll be less disruptive, but these are the kinds of notifications we’re likely to see more of in iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWF6uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;since the risk of annoying you is lower, developers have some incentive to send more frequent, more engaging notifications&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzQfNX"&gt;The other new interruption type is “time sensitive,” which is kind of a Notification Plus. It behaves like a standard notification, lighting up your screen and playing a sound or vibrating, but with an important difference: it’s allowed to break through your focus mode settings and notify you even if they aren’t from an “approved” app. The option to see time sensitive notifications can be turned on and off by the user, so if you really don’t want to see them, you don’t have to. In theory though, they should be for truly time sensitive events, like a package being delivered or your credit card company making sure it was you who bought two round-trip tickets to Maui. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwITss"&gt;In theory. Apple lets developers decide which notifications deserve time sensitive designation, so it’s more or less on the honor system. The company urges them to maintain trust and keep in mind that users can turn off notifications for their app if they feel they’re being bothered unnecessarily. And lest we forget, Apple itself has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165087/ios-apple-push-notification-advertising-marketing-now-allowed-app-store"&gt;bent the rules before&lt;/a&gt; on what’s considered too intrusive for a notification. Could developers end up overusing time sensitive notifications? Possibly, but they likely won’t gain much from doing so, since users can opt out of them and may decide to silence the app entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgEnYi"&gt;There are a few other things worth noting about notifications in iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gzZDTh"&gt;With compatible audio devices like AirPods, Siri will be able to read any incoming notification to you. Previously, this function was limited to things like incoming messages. By default, Siri will read the contents of messages and time sensitive notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mSzX54"&gt;Notifications with a “critical” interruption type basically remain unchanged: these are things like Amber Alerts, which bypass your ringer settings to play a sound and get your attention. App developers still need special permission for these notifications, so we shouldn’t suddenly start seeing more of them in iOS 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2XzQyl"&gt;Notifications will look a little different, with bigger app icons and images of contacts included in messages. The actions you can take on a notification (liking an image, etc.) will get graphical icons, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and macOS 12 take a small but significant step towards a password-less future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1tUEPfMED8zmnB8NwlCuHcLUaY=/0x0:2159x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69438671/chrome_IJmX1jx9w5.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the future you’ll be able to sign up for a service without needing to create a password at all.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXCi8q"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 and macOS Monterey will preview a new feature called “Passkeys in iCloud Keychain,” which is an attempt to help replace passwords with a more secure login process. Instead of logging into an app or website using string of text, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/?time=1141"&gt;a WWDC presentation&lt;/a&gt; showed how you could instead use Face ID, Touch ID, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458935/two-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico"&gt;security key&lt;/a&gt;, to gain access. The Passkeys are then synced across your Apple devices using iCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7rbm"&gt;Although passwords are currently the most popular way to secure accounts, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514225/passwords-fido2-authentication-webauthn-security-key-cybersecurity-online-browser-web"&gt;plagued with a host of problems&lt;/a&gt;. Passwords can be phished, forgotten, and they’re insecure if not used properly (think about the number of times you’ve been tempted to re-use one across multiple accounts). But Apple thinks its new Passkeys solution can solve these problems, as shown by the comparison table below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEhmlHS1ivntfPCHP9_ImpPUD1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652327/XiXVXmKMSV.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple argues its new system is more secure than regular passwords, and more convenient than security keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VW56PC"&gt;In a demonstration, Apple showed how the new feature could remove the need to ever create a password to sign in to an app or website in the first place. Instead of creating a username and password during the sign-up process like normal, Apple authentication experience engineer Garrett Davidson just enters a username and allowed the app to register his Face ID as a Passkey. Then he showed how he could use Face ID to log into the app in future, or even log into his account via the service’s website. It works on Macs with Touch ID, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMpgb5"&gt;The functionality rests on the WebAuthn standard, which Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others have been slowly adding support for over time. Last year Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301509/apple-safari-14-browser-face-touch-id-logins-webauthn-fido2"&gt;added support for it to offer password-less logins&lt;/a&gt; in Safari in iOS and macOS. But the new approach goes deeper, integrating WebAuthn into an app’s sign-up process, and syncing your credentials across Apple devices via iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtSDu3"&gt;Behind the scenes, WebAuthn uses public key cryptography to let you log in without your private credentials ever having to actually leave your device. Instead, your phone or computer is only sending a “signature,” which proves your identity without having to share your secret private key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vN020YCX-omYkcMK4E0cDg7yC3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22652336/2ayp0HbOiQ.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WebAuthn’s process means your most sensitive information never leaves your device when you log in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LAkaoG"&gt;Apple admits that the feature is in its early stages. It’s only releasing in preview this year, and will be turned off by default in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey. Developers can enable it, but it’s not meant for widespread use. There’s also the obvious limitation that the feature relies on iCloud to function, so you’re out of luck if you need to log in to the same service on a Windows or Android device. Apple admits this is a problem, however, suggesting it’s  working towards improving cross-platform support in future. Apps and websites will also need to enable support for the new process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMhC9S"&gt;But the move is another sign of the growing momentum behind ditching passwords. Microsoft has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update"&gt;make Windows 10 password-less&lt;/a&gt;, and Google has been working to make it possible to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20801954/google-passwords-chrome-fido2-webauthn-fingerprint-biometrics-screen-lock"&gt;sign into its services without passwords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82SeVg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hires former Canoo CEO as it ramps up electric car project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5JmsrBSefgoMP7KT9iQdJuFS6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69436099/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P0NglS"&gt;Ulrich Kranz, a former BMW executive and the recently departed CEO and co-founder of EV startup Canoo, has been hired by Apple, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Kranz will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; work on the Silicon Valley behemoth’s electric car under Doug Field, the former Tesla executive who runs the day-to-day operations of the project, which is codenamed “Project Titan.” News of Kranz joining Apple was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/apple-hires-former-bmw-executive-for-its-rebooted-car-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOm0Rh"&gt;Kranz was one of the executives who helped launch BMW’s all-electric i3 hatchback and hybrid i8 sports car. Shortly after he left the German automaker at the end of 2016, he and fellow BMW executive Stefan Krause were tapped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;to help turn around struggling EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;. The pair clashed with Faraday Future’s founder, though, and in late 2017, they left and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;formed what eventually became Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aImjXg"&gt;Kranz, Krause, and a handful of other expats from BMW and other legacy automakers came up with an all-electric van that they planned to sell on a subscription basis only, which they revealed in 2019. The van was designed around a compact, modular platform that included the battery pack, the electric motors, and basically all of the vehicle’s electronics, which Canoo hoped to sell or license to other manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rEWORQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kranz was running Canoo when it held talks with Apple in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STsz7H"&gt;Canoo’s EV platform pitch was attractive enough that Apple held talks with the startup in early 2020, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;exclusively reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Talks between the two companies eventually broke down, though, as Canoo preferred to take an investment, while Apple was interested in an acquisition. Canoo also had an agreement with Hyundai to build vehicles based on the platform, but the startup has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;since walked away from that deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix7J7"&gt;Kranz now finds himself near the top of a very large team inside Apple that is working on an electric, autonomous vehicle. Apple started the project in 2014, but it has gone through multiple revisions, with the company at one point focusing solely on developing autonomous technology. But over the last year, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;shifted back to trying to develop a vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly held talks with multiple automakers as well as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-apple-talks-with-catl-byd-over-battery-supplies-its-electric-car-2021-06-08/"&gt;battery companies like China’s CATL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJDEog"&gt;Kranz was just one of a number of top executives who left Canoo over the last year. Krause, who was Canoo’s first CEO, departed last year. Canoo’s chief financial officer and its chief lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;also left this year&lt;/a&gt; following the startup’s merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Five of the original nine co-founders remain with the company, while those who’ve left have been replaced by people close to the company’s new CEO, Tony Aquila, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;took over after Canoo went public as a result of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGaVTr"&gt;Aquila has since pivoted Canoo away from the subscription model idea and is instead focused on creating commercial electric vehicles for small businesses. Aquila detailed the changes he was making to the company on Canoo’s first call with investors as a public company in March. Kranz was not on that call, despite still being CEO at the time. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported late last year, Kranz’s contract with Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;renegotiated as part of the SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will shut down at the end of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H5XaFSmRqA3ewzz7I7q36VS-jdo=/8x0:877x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434413/Screen_Shot_2021_06_10_at_8.45.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Sky on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBnzIy"&gt;Following Apple’s acquisition of popular weather app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Dark Sky in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Sky’s iOS app and website will be available until the end of 2022, co-founder Adam Grossman said in a Monday update to &lt;a href="https://blog.darksky.net/"&gt;Dark Sky’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-apple-acquisition-shutdown-date/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAX1EV"&gt;The update about the 2022 shutdown hit the same day that Apple announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22527878%2Fdark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new weather features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; as part of its WWDC keynote presentation. The stock Weather app is getting a new design, full-screen weather maps, next-hour precipitation notifications, and even new animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWhDEQ"&gt;Dark Sky shut down the Android and Wear OS versions of its apps on August 1st, 2020. But the iOS app is still available &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357"&gt;for $3.99 on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in buying it ahead of next year’s shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KBtqm"&gt;The Dark Sky API will also continue to work for existing customers until the end of 2022. Previously, the API was set to stop working at the end of this year; now, it will work for a little while longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new health features bring new focus to elder care technology  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbDIdsB8AyFH5gNMa9_bSViPs5k=/0x133:1690x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69434102/824_2021_06_07_824_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ksqI6"&gt;Apple’s new health features will be available for anyone with an iPhone. But two of the tools announced at WWDC 2021, walking steadiness and the ability to share health data with family members, could be particularly useful for older adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOBiA0"&gt;People who work with older adults are excited that a company like Apple is interested in tech that could be used for this group. Experts have spent years frustrated that companies don’t design products to meet the needs of that demographic. There have been a few attempts to introduce new tools, but none got much traction, says Richard Schulz, a social psychologist studying aging at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXROR"&gt;“I think the reason is that the big boys — companies like Apple — never got into it,” Schulz says. The new features are a signal that the tide is starting to turn. “Apple getting into this is a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EzfAG0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear of falling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUjfyk"&gt;The first feature, the walking steadiness indicator, targets a major issue for older adults: falling. Falls are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/older-adult-falls/index.html"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of accidents, injury, and death for seniors in the US, and they’re responsible for billions in healthcare costs each year. Researchers have been studying falls — and trying to figure out ways to prevent them — for decades, says ‪Jacob Sosnoff‬, who studies mobility in the department of physical therapy and rehabilitation science at the University of Kansas Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GShEH"&gt;“We can do a really good job in the lab measuring walking impairment and making predictions and recommendations, but we’re not very good in the real world,” Sosnoff says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYMN0E"&gt;Apple’s new walking steadiness feature aims to track people as they move through their daily lives. It uses metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground to monitor how stable a user is. It can only be measured on the iPhone, not an Apple Watch, because some of the metrics have to be calculated from as close to the hip as possible, Apple says — so in a pocket or a bag works best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjGjD"&gt;Apple Watch already has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;fall detection&lt;/a&gt; feature that can prompt users to call emergency services or automatically make a call if the user is immobile for around a minute. The new iPhone capability focuses on prediction, rather than response: it can tell people if they’re walking steadily and issue an alert if it thinks they’re at an increased risk of falling. Apple says the system is based on data collected during a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ljt9QL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Having people be aware of their fall risk is important”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52srye"&gt;There are no major commercial products that track the quality of people’s movement, Sosnoff says. Until now, most movement trackers have focused on how much people moved. “That’s why there’s a lot of excitement about this,” he says. “Having people be aware of their fall risk is important.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMYTXH"&gt;But there’s also a downside to telling people that they might fall — fear of falling is linked to actually experiencing a fall. If alerts increase that fear, people might limit their physical activity or even stop leaving the house as much, says Clara Berridge, a professor at the University of Washington who studies healthcare technology in aging populations. “That will likely contribute to their actual risk of falling, because they’re decreasing their strength and activity,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EKJ3"&gt;It’s a fine balance, Sosnoff says. “We want people to be aware of the risks but not so overly concerned that they don’t do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeJu5B"&gt;Sosnoff says he’s eager to see if the walking steadiness feature could actually reduce falls in real-world scenarios. One challenge for the tool could be monitoring people whose walking is impaired — like people with a limp, for example. Algorithms that track gait often don’t work as well in those situations, he says. If the Apple feature has that problem, it could flag people with different walking patterns who might not actually be a fall risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMxUFg"&gt;The Apple feature may not be able to help everyone at fall risk. Walking patterns are only one of the many reasons people fall: poor eyesight with age can cause people to trip, certain medications can reduce balance, and items around the house (like loose rugs) can be hazardous. The Apple walking steadiness feature is designed to suggest that people who are at risk of falling do various stability exercises, which can be useful in some cases. But for some people, balance may not be the main problem. “Getting prompted to do exercises isn’t the only solution,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kyioTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rbb8oE"&gt;Getting information on a user’s walk also requires that they carry their phone around regularly. Sosnoff says he’s not sure older adults actually do. Many may use their phones in different ways than younger people. “I know many older adults that leave their phone on the counter just like it’s a traditional phone,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpeiGI"&gt;There are advantages, though, to having a player like Apple working on falls. “They’re going to have a significant amount of data to help see what’s going on,” Sosnoff says. If the iPhone could actually prevent falls, it’d be a huge boon. “We put people back together again if they fall and get hurt, but we don’t really do much to stop the fall. It would be exciting if we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S6B7H1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8YOgpd"&gt;Apple will also now let users share their health data with other people. The feature could be a major convenience for family members and caregivers of older adults, who may want or need to keep track of someone’s health metrics. Currently, they might have to collect information from multiple different sources — a heart rate app, a blood pressure monitor system. The Apple sharing feature could give them direct access in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpjt7n"&gt;“I could see this being extremely appealing for adult children,” Berridge says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foxb1Z"&gt;It also raises privacy concerns for older adults. The Apple feature is controlled entirely by the user, who gets to decide in the app what information they want shared and with whom. In reality, though, older people who aren’t comfortable with technology may not be able to take charge of that decision themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GukAx"&gt;“It’s very common to have an adult child purchase a phone for an older adult, and set up the settings, and take the phone out of their hand and say, ‘let me just fix it for you,’” Berridge says. “That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lAgHDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That older adult is going to lose the capacity to keep this information from the family member”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1hsRR"&gt;Some people might be very comfortable opening up their Health app to family members, but there’s still a power dynamic involved. Older adults tend to like monitoring technology less than their adult children, and say they want to maintain their privacy without feeling watched. But their adult children are confident that they can convince parents to use monitoring technology, even if they say they’re uncomfortable with it, Berridge’s research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102442/"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re not necessarily inclined to engage them in the conversation, they’re just very confident that their preferences would rule at the end of the day,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YORt02"&gt;On the flip side, adult children who use this feature might find themselves inundated with information about their older parents that they’re not sure how to interpret, says social psychologist Schulz. “Decisions have to be made about how that information is parsed and translated for the person who’s getting access,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyIhsr"&gt;In practice, Berridge isn’t sure how useful it would be to have a family member see all of the Health app data. “People may say, okay, what do I do with this information exactly? At what point is it meaningful, when do I call a doctor, and so on. It could be an alert overload situation, too.” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biuqC2"&gt;Despite those concerns, there’s increasing interest in ways to keep older adults healthy at home. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that senior care facilities can be dangerous, and people generally don’t want to live in them, Berridge says. The new features from Apple highlight movement in that direction. “Moving the monitoring out of facilities and into the home is going to be a major trend,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2TrfS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with true wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut, even outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;. There are often sizable discounts on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H3uSbA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. Right now, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodsDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Firgwc%3D1&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$146 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to $200 or lower. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1081859/9383?subId1=VergeAppleAirPodDeals061021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, are also currently selling the AirPods Pro for $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $278&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fHhsSe"&gt;The recently-launched AirPods Max have yet to receive a steep discount, but right now you can pick up the silver and blue configurations at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $50 off their initial retail price, bringing your total to $500. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733321576396561727#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the same models available for $520, however, Amazon’s price remains the lowest price we’ve seen on the AirPods Max to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mpx47T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The best features of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that Apple didn’t announce onstage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RtIW8Ta8Q5MlQo_Rx191AoHx8Q=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433094/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He didn’t tell you everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zj7aSW"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;had its WWDC keynote on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed off the big new features coming to its platforms, but it didn’t have time to show off everything coming to the new versions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipados%2Fipados-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;. So we’ve combed through the preview pages, Twitter, and a good chunk of the internet to see what interesting features got left out of the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sHaPRg"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kLQeaU"&gt;The big features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; were the updates to notifications, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;, and multitasking, but it appears Apple may have been really focusing on the platforms themselves, too. There are a ton of quality-of-life improvements including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="y7L83k"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-new-memoji-customization-with-over-40-outfits-accessibility-options-more/"&gt;More Memoji options&lt;/a&gt; with new outfits and accessibility options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vlFH2t"&gt;FaceTime will let you know when you’re muted but trying to talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHMxjY"&gt;FaceTime will also let you zoom with the back camera so you can finally show people things across the room without standing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0xauwK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210406"&gt;Announce Messages feature&lt;/a&gt; found in AirPods is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/08/carplay-in-ios-15-announce-messages-with-siri-driving-focus-customization-new-wallpapers/"&gt;coming to CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;, so your phone can automatically read texts out loud while you’re driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2fXplS"&gt;Wary iPhone users will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;put off upgrading to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but still get security updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EFDRkR"&gt;Find My will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-find-my-network-can-find-your-iphone-when-it-is-powered-off/"&gt;track your iPhone when it’s off&lt;/a&gt; (or even after it’s been factory reset). It’s currently unclear what phones will support this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95Co4f"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?s=21"&gt;improved print dialog with more options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id="oNzzVp"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NownQt"&gt;The Monterey portion of the keynote was dominated by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;incredibly impressive demo&lt;/a&gt; that showed off Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple also took the time to discuss Shortcuts, which are coming to macOS. Macs are complex machines, though, and there are a few more fun and useful things that will be coming in the fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nmoqSf"&gt;The ability to use your Memoji &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402433116959084545?s=20"&gt;as your user profile picture&lt;/a&gt; (it’ll even shake its head if you try to log in with the wrong password). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FjOpT8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-macos-monterey-privacy-features/"&gt;software microphone indicator light&lt;/a&gt; in the menu to show when an application is listening to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YkP81U"&gt;A better file copy interface, with the ability to pause and resume transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EPT75"&gt;The easy ability to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-erase-all-content-settings/"&gt;erase user data, settings, and apps&lt;/a&gt; without re-installing the OS (great for if you’re selling your Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkvwPu"&gt;The ability to manage your saved passwords in System Preferences. You can also import them from other password managers or export them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KDTUWY"&gt;You can customize the mouse cursor’s outline and fill color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvxtEv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-automatic-window-resizing/"&gt;Windows will resize&lt;/a&gt; when you move them to another monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oNmXPz"&gt;Shortcuts will let you integrate shell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FE5yGR"&gt;An improved Go To Folder dialog in Finder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E62K7I"&gt;And everything coming to... everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="uPCoCx"&gt;Of course, Apple is running an &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; here, so many of the features that got announced will be coming to all of its computers. Here are a few more that will also be coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z0zH2z"&gt;

&lt;li id="spmEQM"&gt;Safari will detect if websites can support HTTPS and will automatically use it if they do (similar to the HTTPS Everywhere extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXX12H"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-low-power-mode/"&gt;A low power mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS and iPad (I can’t wait to see how far I can stretch an M1 MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtN5pt"&gt;Reminders are also getting a tags feature, similar to the one found in Notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="THeoMs"&gt;The Photos info pane will tell you about what Visual Look Up sees in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZdmzFX"&gt;The ability to turn on DownTime whenever, if you really need to focus on something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FhPxUi"&gt;An extension for Edge on Windows that lets you use your iCloud Passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RTxMUm"&gt;Wait, you forgot WatchOS 8!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3W4Tbk"&gt;Well, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;showed off pretty much everything for WatchOS&lt;/a&gt; onstage — it looks like it’s not a big year for the wearable (but I’ll be very happy to get better always-on display support and multiple timers). There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?s=20"&gt;some new time complications, though&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu3swa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just noticed there is a new set of Time complications in watchOS 8.  While a slight bit of ‘Sherlocking’ for Watchsmith, I’m honestly super glad it’s here.  A good number of my gray hairs came from supporting time based complications…glad I can focus elsewhere now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q44aVDMoZh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q44aVDMoZh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Smith (@_DavidSmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>With iCloud Plus, Apple’s privacy promise is paired with an upsell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jNNneQHsZgLw96texISzkDykoEs=/321x158:2040x1304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432729/appleprivacy_vsavov2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some privacy may be paywalled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DAnKrI"&gt;Apple has spent considerable time championing itself as a protector of user privacy. Its CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that privacy is “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;,” the company has based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420108/apple-new-over-sharing-ad-privacy-security-iphone"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; around its privacy promises, and it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;high profile battles&lt;/a&gt; with authorities to keep its users’ devices private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub0zXv"&gt;The pitch is simple: our products protect your privacy. But this promise has shifted very subtly in the wake of this week’s iCloud Plus announcement, which for the first time bundled new security protections into a paid subscription service. The pitch is still “our products keep you safe,” but now one of those “products” is a monthly subscription that doesn’t come with the device in your box — even if those devices are getting more built-in protections as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48bdJE"&gt;iCloud has always been one of Apple’s simplest services. You get 5GB of free storage to backup &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428"&gt;everything from images, to messages and app data&lt;/a&gt;, and you pay a monthly subscription if you want more (or just want to silence &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540"&gt;Apple’s ransom note&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17168618/apple-more-free-icloud-space-200gb"&gt;inevitably run out of storage&lt;/a&gt;). Apple isn’t changing anything about the pricing or storage options as part of the shift to iCloud Plus. Prices will still range from $0.99 a month for 50GB of storage up to $9.99 for 2TB. But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; changing is the list of features you’re getting, which is expanding by three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aUsX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Private Relay and Hide my Email are privacy features included with iCloud Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZYZl"&gt;The first change sits more within iCloud’s traditional cloud storage remit, and is an expansion of Apple’s existing HomeKit Secure Video offering. iCloud Plus now lets you securely stream and record from an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/#:~:text=%20and%202tb%20with%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20homekit%20secure%20video%20cameras%20(%249.99%20per%20month)"&gt;unlimited number of cameras&lt;/a&gt;, up from a previous &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7bc5df9d9/ios#:~:text=up%20to%20five%20cameras"&gt;maximum of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGfrOg"&gt;With the new Private Relay and Hide My Mail features, however, iCloud Plus is expanding its remit from a storage-based service into a storage and privacy service. The privacy-focused additions are minor in the grand scheme of the protections Apple offers across its ecosystem, and Apple isn’t using them as justification for increasing the cost of iCloud. But they nevertheless open the door to so-called “premium” privacy features becoming a part of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;large and growing services empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwdyUq"&gt;The features appear as an admission from Apple about the limits of what privacy protections can do on-device. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;” was how the company put its promise in a 2019 ad, but when your iPhone needs to connect to the internet to browse the web, receive email, and generally earn the “i” in “iPhone,” inevitably some of its privacy rests on the infrastructure serving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPFpAY"&gt;The most interesting of these new features is Apple’s Private Relay, which aims to shield your web traffic from prying eyes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. It hides your data from both internet service providers as well as advertisers that might build a detailed profile on you based on your browsing history. While it sounds a bit like a VPN, Apple claims the Private Relay’s dual-hop design means even Apple itself doesn’t have a complete picture of your browsing data. Regular VPNs, meanwhile, require a level of trust that means you &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/"&gt;need to be careful&lt;/a&gt; about which VPN you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJD1oh"&gt;As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explains, VPNs can protect your data from outsiders, but they “involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pAcd"&gt;“We wanted to take that completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPQkKW"&gt;Here’s how it works. When using Private Relay your internet traffic is being sent via two proxy servers on its way to its destination. First, your traffic gets encrypted before it leaves your device. Then, once it hits the initial, Apple-operated server, it gets assigned an anonymous IP that hides your specific location. Next up, the second server, which is controlled by a third-party, decrypts the web address and forwards the traffic to its destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDWvR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple thinks today’s VPNs pose “a really difficult trust decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFmCY"&gt;Apple can’t see which website you’re requesting, only the IP address you’re requesting it from, and third-parties can’t see that IP address, only the website you’re requesting. (Apple says it also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163871/cloudflare-apple-dns-protocol-online-privacy"&gt;Oblivious DNS over HTTPS.&lt;/a&gt;) That’s different from most “double VPN” and “multi-hop” VPN services you can subscribe to today, where a provider may control both servers. You could perhaps combine a VPN and a proxy server to do something similar, though. Apple says Private Relay won’t impact performance, which can be a concern with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzT2am"&gt;While Private Relay is theoretically more private than a regular VPN, Apple’s offering is also more limited. You can’t use it to trick websites into thinking you’re accessing them from a different location, so you’re not going to be able to use Private Relay to get around geographical limitations on content blocked by a government or a service like Netflix. And it only seems to cover web browsing data through Safari, not third-party browsers or native apps. In a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/"&gt;WWDC developer session&lt;/a&gt; about the feature, Apple says that Private Relay will also include DNS queries and a “small subset of traffic from apps,” specifically insecure HTTP traffic. But there was no mention of other browsers, and Apple clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s only handling app traffic when your app technically happens to be loading the web inside a browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dtq6yXo9hGGm4aRcOWg0hXgVLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649697/Apple_iPhone12Pro_mail_new_message_hide_my_email_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hide my Email provides a slick interface for making burner email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68gn2K"&gt;In addition to Private Relay, iCloud Plus also includes Hide my Email, a feature designed to protect the privacy of your email address. Instead of needing to use your real email address for every site that requests it (increasing the risk of an important part of your login credentials becoming public, not to mention getting inundated with spam), Hide My Email lets you generate and share unique random addresses which will then forward any messages they receive back to your true email address. It’s another privacy-focused feature that sits outside of iCloud’s traditional area of focus, and could be useful even if similar options have been available for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umJUM7"&gt;Gmail, for example, lets you use a simple “+” symbol to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt; add random extra characters to your email address&lt;/a&gt;. Even Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650885/apple-sign-in-sso-tool-data-collection-privacy-ios-13-wwdc-2019"&gt;“Sign In with Apple” service&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar trick, handing out random email addresses to each service you use it with. But the advantage of Apple’s new service is that it gives you an easily-accessible shortcut to generate them right in its Mail app and Safari, putting the feature front and center in a way that seems likely to boost its mainstream appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OktZBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of privacy still included with standard purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wE7vYu"&gt;Apple might be charging for Private Relay and Hide My Email by bundling them into iCloud subscriptions, but these iCloud Plus additions are still dwarfed by the array of privacy protections already built into Apple’s hardware and software. There’s no sign that any of these existing privacy features will be locked behind a monthly subscription fee anytime soon. Indeed, the list of built-in protections Apple offers continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnlgS"&gt;This includes a new Mail Privacy Protection feature in the Mail app in iOS 15, which sends your emails through a relay service to confuse any tracking pixels that might be hiding in them (read more about tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681508/tracking-pixel-email-spying-superhuman-web-beacon-open-tracking-read-receipts-location"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There’s also a new App Privacy Report feature coming to iOS 15 that will show how often apps are accessing your location, camera, microphone, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHcRXNO6nTE0sIh-lo-fiCFma6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649702/Apple_iPhone12Pro_settings_privacy_app_privacy_report_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhones’ list of built-in privacy features continues to expand with iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZojtJ"&gt;But with iCloud Plus, Apple now offers two privacy protections that are distinct from those that are included for free with the purchase of a device, and the division between the two seems arbitrary to some extent. Apple justifies charging for features like Private Relay and Hide My Email because of the incremental costs of running those services, but Mail Privacy Protection also relies on a relay server, which presumably isn’t free to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t46jic"&gt;Regardless of its rationale, choosing to charge for these services means that Apple has opened the door to premium privacy features becoming part of its increasingly important services business, beyond just its hardware business. Adherence to privacy was already part of the company’s attempt to lock you into its devices; now it could become part of the attempt to lock you into its services. All the while, those &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;walls around Apple’s garden&lt;/a&gt; creep higher and higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIhUI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uf8Rp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJDmFx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaoj9p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLU8A2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagAh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
