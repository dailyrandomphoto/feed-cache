    <title>The six-year-old iPhone 6S will get iOS 15, and that rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBUoFOzgTMz04ihhp5021RnhETM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424126/iphone_6s_plus_clean_2_7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus arrived in September 2015 running iOS 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ydGZS"&gt;The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you’ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you — your phone will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUWzSX"&gt;Six years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn’t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security support&lt;/a&gt; for some of its phones. But six years of OS updates and security support puts the 6S in an entirely different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuOLa"&gt;To be sure, there are a lot of new features that won’t work with the 6S’s A9 Bionic processor. Features like the Google Lens-esque Visual Lookup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; in photos, portrait mode in FaceTime, and immersive walking directions in Maps won’t be available to 6S users, since they all require a device with an A12 Bionic chip a la the XS and XR or later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vw84SQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6J0gyt"&gt;It’s also possible that newer software will slow down an older phone with an aging, less nimble processor. That might not necessarily be the case, though — both &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-14-on-the-iphone-6s-and-se-performance-is-fine-other-stuff-is-not/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ios14-older-iphones-3795531/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant impact on performance running iOS 14 on the 6S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS5T8p"&gt;What may be a bigger issue, as both testers noted, is that the 6S shows its age with poor battery life. Features like widgets are also tougher to use on the phone’s 4.7-inch screen, which is quaint compared to today’s standard six-inch-plus panels. These aren’t so much compatibility issues as the inevitable, slow march of time that no gadget can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMJ1dL"&gt;iPhone 6S owners shouldn’t despair, though. They’ll still get potentially useful updates like notification summaries and Focus modes to minimize interruptions throughout the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;video and music sharing&lt;/a&gt; in FaceTime, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;added privacy features&lt;/a&gt; like a seven-day app privacy report to keep tabs on how apps are using your information. There’s also the peace of mind that comes with running the latest OS version, and the security patches and bug fixes that come with it throughout the year. Not a bad deal for a six-year-old device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Screen Time to keep your iPhone use within healthy limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9j9UYVViDxjCj-v3bXiMEjYOLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424084/bfarsace_201106_4269_026.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71fUVO"&gt;We all spend a lot of time on our phones, and it’s possible — just possible — that some of us spend too much time. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;we ran an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to use what was then Apple’s brand-new Screen Time feature, which was built in order to help people keep their on-screen time in some sort of sane proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g5Gbf"&gt;At the time (which was when iOS 12 came out), you could use Screen Time to check how much time you spent on your phone, use an App Limits feature to limit your (or your kids’) daily time spent on various apps or types of apps, or use its Downtime feature to cut off access to all (except a few) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odVZMI"&gt;Since then, and especially since iOS 13 came out, Screen Time has been expanded, making it easier to lock down apps and / or limit your screentime. (There have been no additional features announced so far for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll add them here if there are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRN1jS"&gt;To begin using Screen Time, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time.” Here are some of the things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2VTij"&gt;Daily Average&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pmiNMf"&gt;At the top of the Screen Time app, you can see an accounting of your activity over the course of the day. Click on “See All Activity” to see a breakdown of which specific apps you used and how long you used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggA_yQU7yRGAjbRvvMF5Oyct128=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645210/IMG_5AFD8368F3A3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PUC2UJiLMEeGJQvp2iQ6NVrKWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645212/IMG_B722454A795A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9a4phx"&gt;Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr76BG"&gt;Downtime lets you set periods when you want to force yourself to give your eyes a rest and avoid staring at the screen. It does this by locking down the apps with which you are most likely to spend time. These lockdowns are not absolute — as you’ll see later, you can cancel Downtime when you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztlSvG"&gt;Begin by choosing when you want to start your time away from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jGPz2g"&gt;Tap on “Downtime” and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ULynqq"&gt;Select the days (it can be every day or just on specific days) and times that you want to avoid getting swallowed by your favorite iPhone apps. During those times, only specified apps that you pre-selected (along with phone calls) will be allowed through. For example, you can disable Facebook and Twitter during working hours, but keep the Messages app going for texts. (We’ll go over how to choose which apps to disable in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6xpbLB"&gt;You’ll get a warning before Downtime kicks in. If you need to keep working on an app, don’t worry — you’ll be given the chance to ask for one more minute, to be reminded in another 15 minutes, or to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set Downtime for everyday or specific days, and for set times for each day" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdFBe_H4X6SF5P9swk0plrwrUus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645426/IMG_5D6CBD759B26_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set Downtime for every day or specific days, and for set times for each day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pADXaUsGVY4ryDYQtUOAo0mAl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645432/IMG_9FECEC603727_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbF9r"&gt;Keep in mind that Downtime, and the other Screen Time features, can be applied to all your devices that use iCloud. So if you set it on your iPhone, for example, it can apply to your Mac or iPad as well. To share your settings across your devices, go to the Screen Time main screen and toggle “Share Across Devices” on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrjeu"&gt;Now that you’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you want some downtime, you’ll probably want to select &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; apps should be allowed to remain active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dtarU"&gt;Back in the Screen Time main screen, select “Always Allowed.” Here you can choose which apps you will still have access to during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cuuooE"&gt;You’ll see two sets of apps: Allowed Apps and Choose Apps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifFL5P"&gt;To select an app you’ll always want access to, even during downtime, tap on the app’s name in Choose Apps and it will appear in the Allowed Apps list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w2QVxh"&gt;If you want to disallow any of the Allowed Apps, tap on the minus sign next to the app, and then on “Remove.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FqNQvs"&gt;There are more ways to personalize Downtime. Let’s say you want to get alerted about text messages from specific people — you’re planning to concentrate on a project and don’t want to hear from any of your friends, but you still want to get texts from family members. You can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SDiM1O"&gt;On the same “Always Allowed” page, tap on “Contacts” at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElBJnY"&gt;Under “Allowed Communication,” select “Specific Contacts” and choose which contacts you want to allow through, even during downtime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2NpCxn"&gt;Note that the “Allowed Communication” page is also accessible from the main Screen Time page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gpVsFE"&gt;App Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WJAgoC"&gt;Another way to keep your app use in check is to limit the amount of time you use an app (rather than setting what time of day you can use it). For example, if Twitter tends to be your personal black hole, you can decide not to spend more than, say, two hours on Twitter each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxdU0L"&gt;To set your app limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D2hPC7"&gt;In the Screen Time screen, select “App Limits” &amp;gt; “Add Limit.” Toggle “App Limits” on and tap on “Add Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4taRzN"&gt;You’ll see a list of categories, such as “Social,” “Games,” and “Entertainment.” Tap on a specific category, and it will open up to show a list of all your apps that are in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HVgNG7TqpIvA2ZJEajF91Ze8Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645260/IMG_0AC0E116FFC1_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can limit specific apps or a category of apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVuQKZnLTu1F-8KNNgr9lDJ8oSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645257/IMG_476F28DD6A3A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can limit specific apps or a category of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hSDXif"&gt;Select the apps that you want to limit — or select an entire category to choose all the apps in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dcKdTv"&gt;Tap on “Next” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L3Mu3i"&gt;Select the maximum amount of time you can use the app(s) on a daily basis. When you reach your limit, you’ll be interrupted by a screen that lets you either apply the limit (just tap on the “OK” button), or shrug and select “Ignore Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ymh75o"&gt;If you choose the latter, you can get one more minute, ask to be reminded in 15 minutes, or decide to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how much time you want to spend on an app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKfJy4XokyLHBVGjX8EnbofR02c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645275/IMG_63420372C935_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how much time you want to spend on an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time, or ignore it altogether." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-qXntlLlTVEGUdOsPRZCtrWWpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645285/IMG_7424C1B86747_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time or ignore it altogether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r6JZtS"&gt;Note: if for any reason you don’t want to use an app at all, except for on rare occasions, you can set the Screen Time to 23 hours and 59 minutes. The app will then be out of reach unless you go back into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time” &amp;gt; “App Limits” and disable the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dvoc84"&gt;Screen Time Passcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tDNcaj"&gt;If you want to keep certain apps out of the reach of your kids — or your roommate — then you can create a passcode that will be needed to make any changes to Screen Time. The passcode is also useful if you feel you need an extra barrier before you undo one of your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1NcJMg"&gt;Go to Screen Time and tap on “Use Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FS0GOB"&gt;Set a four-digit passcode, and then reenter it when asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsAy9X"&gt;Enter your Apple ID and password so that you can use it if you’ve forgotten your passcode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uVVIrR"&gt;And that’s it. If you want to change or delete your passcode, go back to Screen Time and select “Change Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LN0t9l"&gt;Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="carjbn"&gt;The last selection in Screen Time isn’t as much concerned with when you use your iPhone as with what you see or hear on it. Select “Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions” if you want to allow or restrict explicit content, keep TV shows or movies to certain ratings, set an age limit for apps, limit which websites are allowed, and set a number of different limits on games (such as multiplayer games, connecting with friends, or private messaging). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql5dhD"&gt;Most of this is geared toward parents who want to oversee what their kids see and hear online, but if you’d rather avoid accidentally crashing into any “adult” websites, it could be useful. There are also a number of privacy features, such as stopping Apple advertising, or not allowing apps to change the settings of your microphone, Bluetooth sharing, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbWXbF"&gt;Apple is extending support for spatial audio to macOS and tvOS. The feature will work with the company’s high-end AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, using the devices’ built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes to create a 3D audio effect that tracks the listener’s head movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KziSGB"&gt;Apple initially announced spatial audio for the AirPods Pro last year and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;impressed us with the feature’s immersive quality&lt;/a&gt;. At this year’s WWDC, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;extended support for spatial audio to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjAYV5"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fmacos-monterey-introduces-powerful-features-to-get-more-done%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22523914%2Fmacos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, spatial audio for macOS will only work with the AirPods Pro and Max on Macs with the company’s latest M1 chip and the macOS Monterey operating system. During this week’s WWDC &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=2357"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Apple said spatial audio would arrive on tvOS sometime “this fall,” offering a “full-surround experience” and “dynamic head tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IrFYs"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/tvos-and-macos-will-get-spatial-audio-support-for-airpods-pro-and-max"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that spatial audio on tvOS will only work with the Apple TV 4K, and it’s not clear what apps on the Apple TV will support the feature. Or when support for spatial audio through other headphones on either platform will be available. We’ve reached out to Apple to find out more and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple came this close to bringing back the away message</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_weZ8TMiDw0Fnx8UrfKhFb2FtvY=/136x0:1600x976/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69422391/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_8.28.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;So close!&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xrI1Jg"&gt;Apple has a habit of, if not innovating outright, then at least presenting the most polished version of existing ideas. Its Universal Control, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;for instance&lt;/a&gt;, is basically a Logitech thing, done beautifully. One of its announcements at WWDC yesterday missed that mark but came achingly close to bringing back a defining feature of the dial-up days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a22Xid"&gt;The announcement in question is, of course, Focus, a new set of features meant to help iPhone users let people know when they are not to be bothered. “It turns out, it’s even easier to step away and focus if people know we’re busy,” Apple’s SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. “So we created an easy way to signal to others when you’re doing that.” Focus solves the problem of either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="2lT1D2"&gt;Leaving notifications on and being annoyed at all times by unnecessary messages or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kcT9IW"&gt;Turning them off, then later explaining to the disbelieving sender that you weren’t purposefully ignoring them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="idJRF3"&gt;As you might recall, though, there’s some historical precedent for a feature that communicates being “away” from your device in the form of a “message” — built right into AOL Instant Messenger almost a quarter-century ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGwcpA"&gt;Here’s a quote: “[It] was the classic finding a solution to a very personal problem: nobody’s answering, what does that mean?” I’ll let you guess if that comes from Apple’s Federighi or AOL’s former design director JoRoan Lazaro. (&lt;a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-aim-away-message-by-the-people-who-were-there/"&gt;Answer here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIl8qD"&gt;AIM was, for a very long time, a hugely successful product. So what’s the issue? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p551n0"&gt;While away messages allowed a level of customization in what non-active users communicated to their friends (anything from specific reasons they were unavailable to ASCII art or song lyrics), Apple’s version merely states “[name] has notifications silenced with Focus.” Yes, focus is capitalized. Instead of using a new feature to gently tell a friend “Sorry, I’m a little in the weeds right now, but I want to hear what you have to say later,” the branded, capitalized Focus feels like I’ve hired Apple as a bouncer to tell my pals to piss off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2P825"&gt;To give Federighi the benefit of the doubt, AIM didn’t start with away status customization. In the &lt;a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/an-oral-history-of-the-aim-away-message-by-the-people-who-were-there/"&gt;same oral history&lt;/a&gt; as the above quote, AIM’s former VP of community Eric Bosco said: “The away message started out as a canned status—‘I’m away’—on the internal IM platform. But then we realized that still wasn’t that helpful. It didn’t specify where you were away to [...] So we thought why not make it more freeform text.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiRQIO"&gt;Fingers crossed that Apple will come to the same realization in the several months between the developer beta of iOS 15 (now) and its public release (sometime this fall). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hjXvpD3Wka_uxHblUCGjZnstu4=/219x0:2472x1502/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69421548/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.07.23_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9iIM9X"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;best moment&lt;/a&gt; of this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC keynote&lt;/a&gt; was a straightforward demo of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS feature&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Control. The idea is simple enough: it allows you to use the keyboard and trackpad on a Mac to directly control an iPad, and even makes it simple to drag and drop content between those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwaDPf"&gt;What made the demo so impressive is how easy and seamless it all seemed. In a classic Apple move, there was no setup required at all. The segment happened so fast that it even seemed (incorrectly, as it turns out) like the Mac was able to physically locate the iPad in space so it knew where to put the mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZO9np"&gt;After Zaprudering the clip and asking Apple a few questions, I now have a better understanding of what’s going on here. It turns out that the entire system is actually simpler than it first appears. It’s essentially a new way to use a bunch of technologies Apple had already developed. That’s not a knock on Universal Control — sometimes the best software features are a result of clever thinking instead of brute force technological improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRbIal"&gt;So here’s what’s happening in that demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtq4BY"&gt;First, you need to get the iPad and Mac relatively close to each other. Universal Control is built off the same Continuity and Handoff features that have long been a part of iOS and macOS. When the devices are close enough, their Bluetooth modules let each other know. Of course, all the devices here need to be on the same iCloud account for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTh0Dr"&gt;Then, you start up Universal Control by dragging your mouse pointer all the way to the left or right edge of your Mac’s screen, then a little bit &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; that edge. When you do, the Mac will assume that you’re trying to drag the mouse over to another device, in this case the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2i0wSI"&gt;So there’s no UWB location detection, just good old assumption. One note is that if you have lots of compatible devices, Monterey assumes that you’re dragging towards the last iPad or Mac you interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cAKru"&gt;At this point, a Wi-Fi Direct connection is made and the iPad will show a small bar on the side with a little bump. It’s a sort of indicator that the iPad is aware you’re trying to drag a mouse into it. Keep dragging and pow, the bump breaks free into a circular mouse pointer. When the mouse is on the iPad screen, both it and the keyboard on your Mac control the iPad. Move it back to the Mac, and you control the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zsXlTvQVI3QlVlJyuvC0euUGN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644352/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FzsBpE"&gt;But there’s a clever little affordance built into that strange bar. There are a couple of arrows inside it, a hint that you can slide that bump up or down before it breaks free into the iPad itself. Doing that is how you line up the iPad’s screen with your Mac’s, so that dragging the mouse between the screens doesn’t result in a weird jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPMi9i"&gt;You go through the same process to set up a second device with Universal Control — it maxes out at three. If all this automatic setup sounds like a hassle, you can just go into system preferences and set a device as your preferred Universal Control buddy gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wedQp1"&gt;However you set it up, you can drag and drop content between devices and it’ll use either Wi-Fi Direct or USB to transfer the files. Of course, if you’re dragging files into the iPad, make sure you have an app open (like Files) that can accept it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ydbY"&gt;That’s pretty much the long and the short of it. There are still some details to hash out, Apple tells me, and it isn’t available in the first developer preview. If you put your dock on the left or right edge of the screen, for example, it’s unclear if this whole setup will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yv8GjH"&gt;What’s fascinating to me about this system — as I discuss in the video above — is that it’s only really possible because of a long series of software enhancements that have been built into the iPad over the years, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="ltFF7z"&gt;Continuity, Handoff, and AirDrop. Universal Control isn’t technically AirDrop, but it’s the same basic idea. All of these are the basic ways that Apple devices communicate directly with each other instead of through the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jaBZCN"&gt;Multitasking. I’m not referring to split-screen, but the support for drag-and-drop that came along with the improved windowing options on the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j4pJPz"&gt;Keyboard and mouse support. That’s an obvious pre-requisite, but it wasn’t always obvious that Apple would put mouse support into the iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sM5K02"&gt;Sidecar. Sidecar’s the tool that lets you use an iPad as a second Mac monitor. I don’t think that Universal Control uses the same bits of software as Sidecar, but I do think that there were probably lessons there about latency that would prove useful here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="HCXPrd"&gt;I had a hunch that there would be a similar story of evolution on the Mac side of this story. I figured that all the iPad and iOS technologies finding their way into the Mac with the last few releases played a part. Catalyst apps turned into native iPad apps for M1 Macs. Control Center, Shortcuts, and Focus mode all are iOS things that are also on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLzZpF"&gt;Nice idea, but wrong. Apple tells me that the foundation on the Mac side is as simple as it seems, based on Continuity and Handoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0BQA8"&gt;I hope that Universal Control works as well in the real world as it did in this staged demo — and I know that’s no sure thing. But what I like about the feature is how it’s just a clever recombination of existing technologies that Apple had already built for other purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxJMO0"&gt;Inside the Apple ecosystem, you expect that the trade you’re making for only using Apple devices is getting synergistic integrations like this. They’ve actually been rarer than I would have guessed the past few years. But as the Mac and the iPad start trading more and more features with each other, I expect we’ll see more of them going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy-focused Private Relay feature isn’t coming to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCCcszVbQIMAVAczbYw8rwNtDus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420969/acastro_180227_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RyoW5M"&gt;Apple’s new Private Relay feature, which is designed to obscure users’ browsing data and protect their privacy, won’t be available in China, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was announced during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference as part of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;subscription bundle called iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Other countries where Private Relay won’t be available include: Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2Cbi9"&gt;The move is the latest concession Apple has made in order to offer its services in China, a market which &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes accounts for almost 15 percent of its revenue. Chinese citizens’ access to the internet is heavily regulated, and there is restricted access to technologies like virtual private networks, or VPNs, which help citizens evade tracking and bypass censorship. It’s worth noting that Apple isn’t itself calling Private Relay a VPN, citing technicalities in how it operates, but the service protects users’ privacy in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VNHGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is one of ten countries not getting the feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcNs4M"&gt;In 2018, Apple started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/26/17052802/apple-icloud-encryption-keys-storage-china"&gt;storing some iCloud encryption keys in China&lt;/a&gt; and transferred its Chinese iCloud operations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17055088/apple-chinese-icloud-accounts-government-privacy-speed"&gt;to a firm located in China&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple said the move would improve the “&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/apple-will-begin-storing-chinese-customer-icloud-data-at-new-china-data-center-from-next-month/"&gt;speed and reliability of iCloud,&lt;/a&gt;” critics said it would also let Chinese authorities access user data through the country’s legal system. The previous year, Apple removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16062172/apple-chinese-app-store-vpn-censorship-crackdown"&gt;several major VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; from its App Store in China in response to local regulations requiring VPN providers to have a government license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IRER6"&gt;According to Apple, Private Relay encrypts a user’s traffic and sends it through two internet relays in such a way that no entity can see the contents of a user’s browsing data. A first Apple-controlled relay assigns a user an anonymous IP address, while a second third-party relay decrypts the web address and forwards the data on to its destination. Apple says Private Relay hides a user’s traffic from ISPs, advertisers, and even Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Apple’s Siri blaze through requests with on-device processing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PTjC3qGo-lVdNte0jv5Cyho9MHA=/223x0:2464x1494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69420125/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_4.20.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a7EPcG"&gt;During the privacy segment of WWDC, Apple talked about moving Siri’s processing from the cloud onto your device, using the “Neural Engine” built into Apple silicon. While having the voice processing happen on your phone instead of one of Apple’s servers is obviously better for privacy, it can also help speed up performance and reliability, as Apple showed off in its demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i0d9M0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Siri_on_Device|102461" data-volume-uuid="fe0397997" data-volume-id="102461" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power of on-device learning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKbVYO"&gt;Now let’s see how fast it is when I try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="35k77u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's the same Siri demo Apple did, but without on-device processing &lt;a href="https://t.co/wLivWJa06p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wLivWJa06p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1402060984739500048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNhEBc"&gt;Compared to my demo, Apple’s is decidedly more snappy — partially because I don’t have to deactivate Airplane Mode each time I turn it on. (My phone still requires an internet connection for the requests that come after, but the on-device model doesn’t.) Full disclosure: my demo took a few takes, and the first few times the phone did warn me that turning on Airplane Mode would make Siri inaccessible, and I had to tap the switch that turns it off, since I couldn’t do it with my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLXOZp"&gt;Apple processing Siri requests on-device should help its users be more confident about the privacy of their data: back in 2019, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932064/apple-siri-private-conversation-recording-explanation-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;contractors were listening to some Siri requests&lt;/a&gt;, something that wouldn’t happen if those requests were being handled by your phone alone. While Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836760/apple-apology-siri-audio-recordings-privacy-changes-contractors"&gt;tried to make that situation right&lt;/a&gt; by being more transparent and making Siri recordings opt-in, handling more Siri requests on the phone is a good way to make the service a little more trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DnqUki"&gt;At today’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021#comments"&gt;showed off its new version of macOS&lt;/a&gt;, and with it a feature called Universal Control, which lets you use your Mac’s mouse or trackpad to control the cursor on an iPad or another Mac’s screen, reaching into and across multiple devices. On paper it doesn’t sound that groundbreaking, but Craig Federighi did something really cool during the demo: he moved his cursor onto an iPad, then clicked on a photo and dragged it across two other computers to drop it into a Final Cut timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sJQBvt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-451" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is called Universal Control, and could be incredible if it actually works this well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWTb9E"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Foptions%2Fpage%2Fflow-multi-device-control&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s Flow&lt;/a&gt; and programs like &lt;a href="https://symless.com/synergy"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt; have similarly allowed users to easily jump between computers, it’s usually not this impressive in real life — some solutions require special hardware, some don’t support actually dragging and dropping, and some have complicated setups. Apple’s version seems seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqP3qM"&gt;It is worth noting that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523322%2Fapple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few small caveats for Universal Control — it will only work with three devices (so Apple was showing its full capabilities in this demo), and it won’t work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;every device getting the new versions of macOS and iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWU90M"&gt;Here’s the list of Macs can initiate Universal Control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AwsDZf"&gt;MacBook Pro (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v0RuhF"&gt;MacBook (2016 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YFdhnx"&gt;MacBook Air (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="97MVZg"&gt;iMac (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z9rufZ"&gt;iMac (5K Retina 27-inch, Late 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekWpqQ"&gt;Mac mini (2018 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2hijKT"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NTw2Sn"&gt;Mac Pro 2019&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zCaeNQ"&gt;As for iPads, it’ll work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k0tMIM"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qGXx8i"&gt;iPad Air (3rd generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XfIcyX"&gt;iPad (6th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WwSl4n"&gt;iPad mini (5th generation and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hybx8"&gt;While the feature does work with iPads, it has to be initiated on the Mac — if you were hoping to sling a file over to your Mac using an Apple Pencil or your finger, you’re out of luck (as fun as that sounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wruU5g"&gt;Apple says the feature doesn’t require any setup (besides having your two devices being logged in with the same Apple ID and having Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff turned on), but until we actually use it there’s no way to know how quick and reliable it might be. Will it work every single time you set your iPad down next to your iMac, or will you find yourself tapping your fingers on the desk waiting for them to realize that they should be communicating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIJyoQ"&gt;Obviously we’ll have to see how Universal Control works in real life, but the demo makes it seem like everything, as the saying goes, just works — Federighi brought the computers close to each other, and could hop between keyboards, mice, and screens. It makes for an incredible demo, which hints at the eternal dream of computing: being able to just use all your devices together, no matter their form factor or OS (though, of course, this version of the dream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;ignores non-Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCeuCf"&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2TAcB"&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new App Store guidelines put scammers and bounty hunters on notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek2fG15nxoop_N9tul87JjPv-hU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69419904/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZfJNX"&gt;Apple has just updated &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/"&gt;its App Store Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the document that tells iPhone and iPad developers what kind of behavior the company will tolerate and where it’s likely to reject apps or crackdown after the fact — and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/"&gt;as TechCrunch reports&lt;/a&gt;, many of today’s changes are aimed directly at scammers and fraudsters who prey on Apple users. But not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BClSYl"&gt;I just put the entire thing through a diff checker to show you exactly what’s changed. &lt;a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/xwG6ItKe"&gt;Check out all the differences here&lt;/a&gt; for yourself, or read on for the highlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fZ5PXa"&gt;Apple is warning fraudsters it’s coming for their entire accounts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="31KzO4"&gt;Apple already had a section titled “5.6 Developer Code of Conduct” that warned devs not to “prey on users or attempt to rip off customers” among a laundry list of other bad behavior. Now, it also includes two clear warnings and a possibility of redemption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GmaUjZ"&gt;Repeated manipulative or misleading behavior or other fraudulent conduct will lead to your removal from the Apple Developer Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj7GKi"&gt;Your Developer Program account will be terminated if you engage in activities or actions that are not in accordance with the Developer Code of Conduct. To restore your account, you may provide a written statement detailing the improvements you plan to make. If your plan is approved by Apple and we confirm the changes have been made, your account may be restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OsdV8m"&gt;Apple will count slippery identities, fake reviews, negative reviews, and other warning signs against a developer’s standing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="We2Way"&gt;These three sections of the Developer Code of Conduct are brand-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.2"&gt;5.6.2 Developer Identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2h8jt"&gt;Providing verifiable information to Apple and customers is critical to customer trust. Your representation of yourself, your business, and your offerings on the App Store must be accurate. The information you provide must be truthful, relevant, and up-to-date so that Apple and customers understand who they are engaging with and can contact you regarding any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.3"&gt;5.6.3 Discovery Fraud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M767K2"&gt;Participating in the App Store requires integrity and a commitment to building and maintaining customer trust. Manipulating any element of the App Store customer experience such as charts, search reviews, or referrals to your app erodes customer trust and is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5.6.4"&gt;5.6.4 App Quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMnmrY"&gt;Customers expect the highest quality from the App Store, and maintaining high quality content, services, and experiences promotes customer trust. Indications that this expectation is not being met include excessive customer reports about concerns with your app, such as negative customer reviews, and excessive refund requests. Inability to maintain high quality may be a factor in deciding whether a developer is abiding by the Developer Code of Conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="T9xo1B"&gt;Misleading marketing is also not allowed, up to and including bait-and-switch pricing. These bolded parts of section 2.3.1 are new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="bSCaos"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;marketing your app in a misleading way, such as by promoting&lt;/strong&gt; content or services that it does not actually offer (e.g. iOS-based virus and malware scanners) &lt;strong&gt;or promoting a false price, whether within or outside of the App Store, is grounds for removal of your app from the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;App Store&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and termination of your developer account.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mscnuT"&gt;All of this seems directly aimed at Apple’s scam problem, where the most profitable company in the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;hasn’t managed to stop egregious scams that are so obvious you could easily find them yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and where &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/"&gt;found 2 percent of the company’s top grossing apps were fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s unclear whether enforcement will improve alongside these new rules. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;apparently didn’t get an answer to that in its briefing with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s8VjOY"&gt;Bounty hunter apps are on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2vmqfs"&gt;Remember when Citizen’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;encouraged his users to hunt down an innocent person by offering a $30,000 reward?&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s new rule seems designed to tamp down on vigilante justice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jzFXD4"&gt;1.7 Reporting Criminal Activity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Lt4Pz"&gt;Apps for reporting alleged criminal activity must involve local law enforcement, and can only be offered in countries where such involvement is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="y3iPC8"&gt;Hookup apps are also on notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CopHmF"&gt;I’m not sure which app made the headlines this time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4672800/bang-with-friends-returns-ios-app-store-down"&gt;but Apple’s tangled with this issue&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WNB1rb"&gt;1.1.4 Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined by Webster’s Dictionary as “explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” &lt;strong&gt;This includes “hookup” apps that may include pornography or be used to facilitate prostitution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="F6tnLX"&gt;Legal weed is OK, but it’s gotta be legal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JXfBvo"&gt;Weed apps have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/13/8032867/massroots-back-in-app-store"&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;-and-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21274431/pax-web-app-era-controls-apple-store-ban"&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; on iPhone for many years, and not for lack of rules. This is more about letting developers know that a certain narrowly defined category is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ehneBs"&gt;(ix) Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, &lt;strong&gt;legal cannabis use&lt;/strong&gt;, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. &lt;strong&gt;Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="enJ7Tx"&gt;You don’t need to give Apple a cut of physical gift card sales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TuvjUR"&gt;Apple said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;it doesn’t take a cut of physical purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Were physical gift cards an exception? Either way, you don’t have to pay now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="RsQnA1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital&lt;/strong&gt; gift cards, certificates, vouchers, and coupons which can be redeemed for digital goods or services can only be sold in your app using in-app purchase. &lt;strong&gt;Physical gift cards that are sold within an app and then mailed to customers may use payment methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pal2sA"&gt;Apple’s most arbitrary rules aren’t gone, but tamped down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpj2U8"&gt;Of all the rules in the App Store, the “don’t include irrelevant information” is probably the easiest to abuse; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;developers like ProtonMail have told us&lt;/a&gt; it’s used to justify removing an app when there aren’t any actually relevant rules. It also irks developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405140/apple-rejects-facebook-update-30-percent-cut"&gt;who believe they should be able to tell their users&lt;/a&gt; about the hoops they have to jump through to get into the store. It’s not gone, but it’s shorter now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZcitE5"&gt;2.3.10 Make sure your app is focused on the &lt;strong&gt;iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS&lt;/strong&gt; experience, and don’t include names, icons, or imagery of other mobile platforms in your app or metadata, unless there is specific, approved interactive functionality. Make sure your app metadata is focused on the app itself and its experience. Don’t include irrelevant information, &lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;including but not limited to information about Apple or the development process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NEFvAI"&gt;Also, Apple’s clearer now that — with certain kinds of apps, and outside the app itself, and only if you get their contact info elsewhere somehow — developers actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tell their users that they can pay outside of Apple’s store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rO4nkx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers cannot use information obtained within the app to target individual users outside of the app to use purchasing methods other than in-app purchase (such as sending an individual user an email about other purchasing methods after that individual signs up for an account within the app). Developers can send communications outside of the app to their user base about purchasing methods other than in-app purchase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WMJC8f"&gt;That doesn’t fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;the company’s anti-steering rules in the least, which came up prominently during the Epic-Apple trial,&lt;/a&gt; but it does make edge cases clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxWOm8"&gt;Apple wants apps to let users be free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DUkFJK"&gt;5.1.1 (v) Account Sign-In: If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a login. &lt;strong&gt;If your app supports account creation, you must also offer account deletion within the app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tYwJs9"&gt;Neat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tVl89j"&gt;Oh, and Roblox is still totally not a game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="c3kFx4"&gt;This section is all-new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1.2.1"&gt;1.2.1 Creator Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4YwhV"&gt;Apps which feature content from a specific community of users called “creators” are a great opportunity if properly moderated. These apps present a singular, unified experience for customers to interact with various kinds of creator content. They offer tools and programs to help this community of non-developer creators to author, share, and monetize user-generated experiences. These experiences must not change the core features and functionality of the native app—rather, they add content to those structured experiences. These experiences are not native “apps” coded by developers—they are content within the app itself and are treated as user-generated content by App Review. Such creator content may include video, articles, audio, and even casual games. The App Store supports apps offering such user-generated content so long as they follow all Guidelines, including Guideline 1.2 for moderating user-generated content and Guideline 3.1.1 for payments and in-app purchases. Creator apps should share the age rating of the highest age-rated creator content available in the app, and communicate to users which content requires additional purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7CBbOt"&gt;If you’re wondering what Apple is on about here, here’s the TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaCl0b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Apple doesn’t want to allow cloud gaming services like Stadia and xCloud into the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, so it told everyone each game in a collection of games had to be individually approved — even though that rule didn’t exist until Apple retroactively added it. Then everyone pointed out Roblox is a collection of games that weren’t individually approved, LOL. Apple argued at trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;that Roblox isn’t a game&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;Roblox amusingly agreed&lt;/a&gt;. Now Apple is now carving out a brand new category of “Creator Content” to cement why Roblox is OK, while other game platforms that contain multitudes are not. Simple!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Series 6 is one of many Apple Watches currently on sale ahead of Prime Day. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and cellular connectivity, which starts at $399. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3 beyond the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Amazon Prime Day&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent price. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793219252543422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, both &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-42mm-Silver-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version of the SE for $269 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger GPS model, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have several color configurations of the 44mm model for $299, a 4-percent discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwogLj"&gt;If you are looking for the 40mm model with GPS, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red version for $329&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. It’s also currently available in several colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793385278132874" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7LoAo"&gt;If you prefer the larger model, the 44mm GPS configuration is also currently discounted to $359 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, again, assuming you don’t mind the red version. You can also pick it up in a range of different colors at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F896099320%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742793655975172725" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $359.&lt;/p&gt;
