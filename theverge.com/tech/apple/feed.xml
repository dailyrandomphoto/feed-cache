    <title>iDOS 2 emulator gets App Store takedown notice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ThwAhJXfUc8_F8wPgMVS4rjhlE=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69623799/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sXrrZo"&gt;Apple may be removing &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/idos-2/id918131840"&gt;iDOS 2&lt;/a&gt;, a popular (or, at the very least, popular for a DOS emulator designed to run decades-old software and games) emulation app that allows users to run DOS games and software on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYifKw"&gt;According to the developer, &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone"&gt;Chaoji Li&lt;/a&gt;, Apple issued the notice of the pending takedown after a recently submitted update for a bug fix. While iDOS 2 has been available since 2014 on the App Store, it seems that with the most recent update, the company has changed its mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu4IOM"&gt;Per the letter that Li received: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3ipJ2B"&gt;Upon re-evaluation, we found that your app is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. Specifically, we found your app is in violation of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfvJkd"&gt;Guideline 2.5.2 — Performance — Software Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoIXfN"&gt; During review, your app installed or launched executable code, which is not permitted on the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13pbDM"&gt;Specifically, your app executes iDOS package and image files and allows iTunes File Sharing and Files support for importing games. Executing code can introduce or changes features or functionality of the app and allows for downloading of content without licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mPT4QF"&gt;Li had previously been forced to go four years without an update to iDOS 2 due to Apple’s restrictions on bundling game files, but he &lt;a href="https://litchie.com/2020/09/idos2-update"&gt;was able to update the app&lt;/a&gt; in September 2020 with changes that enabled iDOS 2 to use iOS’s document-sharing feature to let users import their own files. An earlier version of the app, iDOS, had been briefly available on the App Store in 2010, but &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/26/idos-emulator-supports-dos-and-windows-3-0-on-ios-devices/"&gt;was pulled&lt;/a&gt; by Apple shortly after it was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppCEJu"&gt;Since that September update, Li was also able to submit a dozen other updates to his app, each without issue. Li claims to have been extremely upfront with Apple’s reviewers during each update submission, noting that while the app does run external code, it does so in a sandboxed environment (meaning there’s no security risk that could compromise user data on the rest of the operating system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9Fw6"&gt;For whatever reason, though, Apple appears to have changed its mind on enforcing this section of its App Store rules. It’s not clear what exactly has changed here, although Li speculates that a recent burst of popularity (helped by tweets from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1409191922682400770"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; tech editor Harry McCracken&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/739100/how-to-install-windows-31-on-an-ipad/"&gt;guide from &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows how the app could be used to run Windows 3.1 on an iPad) may have caused Apple’s change of heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxVcHe"&gt;Apple has given Li 14 days to update his app to remove the ability to run executable code — which would render it completely useless. Li has already said he doesn’t intend to make that change, explaining that doing so “would be a betrayal to all the users that have purchased this app specifically for those features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9nGz"&gt;For now, iDOS 2 is still available on the App Store for $4.99, but if Apple sticks to its word, it likely won’t be around to purchase for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eV8chx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha5fHi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio and lossless streaming are now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEEq4hgQe0J1hx7btXgB9fEu1TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622020/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Az5rUL"&gt;Apple Music listeners on Android can now take advantage of the Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming features that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;debuted on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS&lt;/a&gt; over a month ago. The latest update of the app for Android adds support for both features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UUoqv"&gt;Lossless should be available pretty universally on Android devices. Apple includes all the same warnings as on iOS about it consuming “significantly more data.” Like on Apple’s own platforms, Apple Music advises that external hardware like a DAC is required if you want to step up to hi-res lossless. (I’m curious whether this still applies on LG’s audiophile-friendly phones, which have an excellent built-in DAC, but haven’t had the chance to test yet.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xMQl1h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H6fzOe"&gt;Spatial audio support on the Android side seems a more limited, however. Although the feature works with any headphones — just like on iPhone — Apple notes that your phone itself needs to support Dolby Atmos to enable spatial audio. On my Pixel 4A 5G, there’s no option for “Dolby Atmos” in the audio section of Apple Music’s settings. Other colleagues with more flagship-tier devices have a toggle for Atmos there. So I guess that’s the easiest way to tell whether your phone is capable of spatial audio playback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4YuHP"&gt;The beta version of Apple Music for Android actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;tipped off&lt;/a&gt; that lossless and hi-res audio were coming to the service even before Apple made an official announcement. But now both are available on the regular Apple Music app for Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso doesn’t need surprise to be good in season 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM0cHWUBShm0GP1FiHJZshn2YLo=/186x0:5747x3707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621972/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020112.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaoNPq"&gt;TV’s nicest guy is back, as &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; and its eponymous, eternally optimistic American football coach-turned-English Premier League gaffer (played by a golden-hearted Jason Sudeikis) returns for a second season on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyasR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 1 and the first episode of season 2 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc-Txgz3oKkkE2A9JcIgvI2BrVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735340/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JzxbJN"&gt;The good news: the second season is off to an excellent start, picking up a few months after the crushing loss and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"&gt;relegation&lt;/a&gt; of the fictional Richmond team down to the second-tier Championship. But unlike season 1, the new episodes don’t have the benefit of being a pleasant surprise — season 2 has been hyped up for months, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;including a spotlight slot&lt;/a&gt; at one of Apple’s tech events alongside a new iPhone announcement. Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vy7Yxl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVqHon"&gt;Unlike the first season, which largely focused on the soccer-ignorant Ted working to win over his skeptical team, the new season has the Richmond crew already on his side, even as they still struggle to actually succeed on the pitch. And it’s that climb back to sporting success that appears to be a major point of the new season, something that even Ted’s endless enthusiasm might not be able to solve on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Hjuk"&gt;New in the second season is Sarah Niles (&lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt;) as Sharon, a sports psychologist brought in to help the Richmond players, who represents a cooler, more professional take on self-improvement than Ted’s warm and fuzzy persona. It’s an interesting dynamic that should be fun to see progress throughout the season. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExOJDi6P8NlB7OnmgLgLubq6CmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735343/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKaW1n"&gt;But the most encouraging thing from &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is just how well the show continues to work, at least so far. The first season of the show, rather improbably based on some old NBC Sport commercials, came seemingly out of nowhere last summer, before slowly snowballing into Apple TV Plus’ most unexpected hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NuoGM"&gt;The show debuted on the service with more of a whimper than a bang, before word-of-mouth and its undeniably charming cast of underdogs managed to turn the similarly   underdog series into Apple’s flagship series, complete with a bevy of Emmy nominations and awards to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wEDcU"&gt;There were some concerns that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success could have been a flash in the pan, a combination of a highly bingeable show, Apple’s extended free trials for TV Plus, and a jaded populace just looking for something optimistic and upbeat after the relentless terribleness of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ut9zYh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ted Lasso’s success is more than just a fad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1PLyS"&gt;Season 2, however, shows that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success is more than just a fad. The show’s brand of goodness (which continues to avoid tilting over into cloying early in the second season) is, if not always relatable, at least aspirational. The show’s cast of characters ultimately feel human, and it’s hard not to root for them to succeed, whether at soccer or at just being better people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsuUIC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest challenge still lies ahead, though. The show returns for its second season today, with just a single episode, and will break the usual mold for streaming shows by debuting new episodes weekly for the next 12 weeks on Apple’s streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoHuW8"&gt;Coupled with the fact that Apple’s service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;just ended its free trial&lt;/a&gt; for all of its earliest subscribers, Ted won’t have to just win over a bunch of gruff footballers — he’ll have to get viewers to shell out Apple’s $5 per month subscription until October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ffdvO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple MagSafe Battery Pack review:  convenience over capacity</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Perfectly designed for the iPhone, but not a lot of charge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mv1rms"&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack is a white rectangle you can stick to the back of an iPhone 12 to charge it. It’s Apple’s third run at designing an external battery solution for the iPhone and I like it better than the earlier battery cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exfu7u"&gt;However, anybody considering spending $99 on this battery ought to keep one important fact in mind: even Apple cannot break the laws of physics. It is just as bound by the same rules of magnetism and electrons as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOZZHa"&gt;Those laws require tradeoffs: A battery that could fully charge up most iPhone 12 models would be big. A battery small enough to not look odd on a phone wouldn’t have enough juice. Plus, electrons can only flow so fast without building up heat and degrading the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="35Ynq9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t defeat the laws of physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZnHT6"&gt;Apple found a balance between all those extremes and it maintains that balance with a tight software integration that aggressively manages how this battery charges your phone. The result is a gadget that’s singularly focused on the iPhone — sometimes to its own detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPVBma"&gt;The best part about the MagSafe Battery is that it also serves as a fast-charging wireless MagSafe puck when it’s plugged in. So the big question is whether all that is enough to justify the price, especially compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IkVgoJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CY6cYp"&gt;The MagSafe Battery doesn’t have enough energy to fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini from zero to 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDUiI9"&gt;In my testing, the MagSafe Battery was fully drained when my iPhone 12 Mini reached 83 percent, which took 130 minutes of charging. I didn’t have it plugged in for this test, which meant it charged at a relatively pokey 5W speed, so as to minimize heat and maximize the battery’s longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJY99r"&gt;I used the iPhone very sporadically during the charging period (mostly to record the results every 15 minutes), though I did listen to a 15-minute podcast over Bluetooth which slowed the charging down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSIBi"&gt;Bottom line: it’s a small battery and it will help you top up your iPhone, not fully charge it. On larger iPhone 12 models, it won’t even hit that 83 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oG47H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It performs better than its 1,460mAh rating would suggest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHfQPO9Akof4nKcvPy2tOkdDU2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733362/DSC02778_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGKgdGSoVtUCmkvmzsTidUJvvb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733367/DSC02789_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTf0Fe"&gt;There is a discussion to have about what the right way to talk about battery size is. The MagSafe Battery only has a 1,460mAh battery, but that number isn’t comparable to other batteries because it can push through more volts (7.62V). So the MagSafe Battery’s rated 11.13Wh (Watt-hours) is the number that actually matters. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker makes a 5,000mAh battery with wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and magnets for under $50. It’s rated at 18.5Wh, so the differences are smaller than they first appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5jxgt"&gt;The battery measurement discussion is interesting, but it doesn’t change the fact that the MagSafe Battery is simply small. It’s meant to be pocketable and easy to carry, and so you should think of it as something that can stretch your battery life just a little — not get you through multiple days away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10L4qZ"&gt;As you might expect, the software experience with the MagSafe Battery is tightly integrated into the iPhone. There are big animations that show the charge of both your phone and the battery when you attach it. It shows up on the battery level widget, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D1sYM"&gt;More interestingly, when you first attach the battery, your iPhone will pop up a notice that this battery won’t charge your phone above 90 percent — by design. Those last few percentage points put a lot of stress on batteries, and in this context it’s just not worth it. I think it’s a smart move, but if you absolutely want that last 10 percent, you can long press the battery icon in the Control Center and tell it to charge past 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpqMfamewmQtoxQWS4fzM2o6JSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733391/DSC02736_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2C2x6Q9ZfJwS723cnSduTH_uyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733395/DSC02737_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVmQo"&gt;I know this sounds both complicated and disappointing, but in use it’s actually the opposite. I would just slap the battery on the back of my phone when I was worried about battery life and didn’t sweat the details. The result was not needing to keep an eye on battery life as much as I usually do. It’s elegant instead of powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I63fDm"&gt;That’s all smart, but it only happens with the iPhone. It is certainly a nicer overall experience than you’d get with the Anker battery, which is thicker to boot. But the Anker has other advantages. Its battery is bigger, for one thing. It also has a USB-C port on it that both takes charge when plugged in &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can be used to charge devices via a wire. It’s less elegant for iPhone users, but it’s much more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brd6xx"&gt;The Lightning port on the bottom of the MagSafe Battery means iPhone users can keep using the same charging cable, so it’s probably the right call to keep it. It’s just too bad that Lightning can’t charge in either direction like a USB-C port can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtsqaOrbK1sEKzSO_o-PStYZwqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733335/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="klt8W8"&gt;The MagSafe Battery is designed to match the dimensions of the iPhone 12 Mini perfectly. It aligns exactly to the edges and is more comfortable to hold than I expected. If you have a larger iPhone, it will sit on the back a bit more awkwardly — it looks positively tiny on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="OC1jUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every battery pack looks silly attached to a phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yuxtv"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1417548597785202689"&gt;polled Twitter for questions&lt;/a&gt; about the battery and I was taken aback by the vitriol I saw in my replies — and elsewhere. It’s easy to make fun of how a battery pack looks on the back of a phone. It’s also easy to go after it for not providing enough charge. Having used it, I’m not sure I’d want it any larger and I certainly wouldn’t want it any smaller. To me, there’s no such thing as a good-looking external battery. At the end of the day, they’re all squarish or oblong hunks of plastic or metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodY2M"&gt;The white plastic has a matte finish that helps a little with grip, but I wouldn’t call it soft touch. I do wonder if it’ll pick up stains from blue jeans over time, but in the few days I’ve been testing it, it’s remained clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJkFgB"&gt;It snaps on the back of a caseless iPhone with a satisfying snick. It’s as secure as I think can be fairly expected from something connected with magnets. It’d be nice if the alignment magnet was a little stronger, but I am glad that my iPhone doesn’t contain magnets so strong that it messes with credit cards. Physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gnySp"&gt;You can intentionally shake off the battery or have it slip off when putting it in your pocket, but I didn’t have those problems. However, if you are planning on using it with a case, you absolutely need a MagSafe compatible case that itself has magnets on it. I use a very thin plastic case and that minimal layer was more than enough to stop the magnets from working effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2O_OrQpi14EUvmfjoI85z4PHeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733340/DSC02781_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q6FsGU"&gt;After two days testing a couple different MagSafe Batteries on both an iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, I came to a surprising conclusion. My favorite part isn’t the battery, it’s the MagSafe charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4oeA8"&gt;When I think of the MagSafe Battery as a MagSafe charging puck that just happens to have a battery attached to it, I think it makes a little more sense as a product. Apple’s MagSafe puck costs $40 — that certainly doesn’t make the $99 asking price for this battery a deal, but it might be worth buying the battery instead of the puck for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEKKns"&gt;I do have to point out that for $99 I would have expected Apple to at least include a Lightning cable. It doesn’t, nor does it include a charging brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyPkVs"&gt;When plugged into a powerful enough wall charger, the MagSafe Battery can charge the phone at up to 15W, just like the standard MagSafe disc. The charger can fill up both itself and your iPhone. If you want to prioritize charging speed on the iPhone, you can plug &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; in instead and then the iPhone will use reverse wireless charging to top up the battery. (Unfortunately and unlike Android phones, the iPhone’s reverse wireless charging doesn’t work for other devices, like AirPods.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CjsYo_ztMxG5Gs0F81pBS-1Azg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733349/DSC02759_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p4evuG"&gt;The MagSafe Battery’s best feature is that it is a good MagSafe wireless charger. It’s also a decent battery — but only if you think of it as a small extender, one that trades longevity for size. Do I wish it had more capacity? Of course. I also wish it could have more capacity without getting any larger than it already is. I don’t begrudge physics and I get why Apple chose the size it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk8y9b"&gt;But paying $99 for all the MagSafe Battery’s elegance and integration doesn’t make sense when there are much cheaper options that are less beholden to working with just one phone. A battery pack is going to look silly no matter what, you might as well get one that’s as versatile as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MagSafe Battery Pack teardown confirms dual-cell design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9rYSCHC435mwbloA9qNNcfMKdA=/1x0:2149x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621406/J4hYWZ4XRA.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo" target="_blank"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zWfE7C"&gt;A teardown of Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575678/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-12-pro-mini-max"&gt;$99 MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1hjrdPuMGo"&gt;Charger Lab&lt;/a&gt; has given us our best look yet inside the new accessory, and revealed more details about how it works. For starters, it confirms recent speculation that it uses a pair of battery cells wired in series like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F34004%2Fthis-x-ray-teardown-really-smarts-iphone-11-smart-battery-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F23%2F22590033%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack-teardown-dual-cell-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s previous Smart Battery cases&lt;/a&gt;, but it also gives us a look at the NFC circuitry and heat shielding within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DguWsG"&gt;A dual-cell design is important, because it allows the voltage of the battery pack to be higher than a comparable single-cell design. While each individual cell is labelled as being 3.82 volts, the overall voltage of the battery pack is 7.62 with them wired in series. It means the pack should be capable of supplying more power than its 1,460mAh capacity would suggest when compared directly with the battery capacities of the iPhone itself, with a total power output of 11.13Wh. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/14/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-has-more-capacity-than-it-seems---heres-why"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; has a good writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the science if you’re after more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TC4HBNfTLHpeD7OPmXiGfNZMv0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735219/J4hYWZ4XRA.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dual-cell design of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3qrhmO"&gt;Beyond the battery cells, the teardown gives us a good look at how the battery pack dissipates heat. In February, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22290938/apple-magsafe-iphone-battery-pack-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the pack, it noted that development had been set back because the iPhone’s software kept thinking the accessory was overheating. It’s unclear if this problem was overcome with software or hardware fixes, but clearly a lot of effort has gone into keeping the pack cool while allowing it to supply enough power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61wG0z"&gt;Unlike the right-to-repair advocates over at iFixit, Charger Lab doesn’t offer a repairability score at the end of its teardowns. But the amount of adhesive and concealed tabs holding the battery pack together don’t make it look very user serviceable. We’ll have more details on how it performs in practice in our forthcoming review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MacBook Air with 13-inch Mini LED display reportedly on the way for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tShVSGHktqXlxZJTYfxLn3SW0WA=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621226/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImFNZq"&gt;Apple plans to announce a redesigned MacBook Air with a 13.3-inch Mini LED display in the middle of 2022, according to a new investor note from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/22/kuo-apple-to-announce-new-macbook-air-with-13-inch-mini-led-display-in-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/mini-led-macbook-air-mid-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The prediction is in line with Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/"&gt;previous reports&lt;/a&gt;, but offers a more specific timeframe. It also suggests the new Air will have a slightly smaller display than the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros that are said to be on the way this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWwrr6"&gt;Mini LED is a relatively new display technology that’s designed to offer some of the benefits of OLED — such as better contrast levels and improved dynamic range — without the risks of burn-in. It made its Apple debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;on this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo has previously listed around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163328/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-imac-ipad-pro-mini-led-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;half a dozen Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; scheduled to migrate to the new displays, including a 27-inch iMac Pro, 14.1-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, 10.2 iPad, and 7.9-inch iPad Mini. Apple is able to include the more premium displays because of cost-savings associated with using its own silicon, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hKFOye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new display, alongside MagSafe charging and a more powerful processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQM0F2"&gt;Alongside the new display technology, the upcoming MacBook Air will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;reportedly feature  MagSafe charging&lt;/a&gt;, a thinner and lighter design, as well as two USB 4 ports. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the new Air will be powered by a “direct successor” to this year’s M1 processor. The new chip is said to include the same number of CPU cores, running at faster speeds, and an increased number of GPU cores. The current M1 processor is available with seven or eight GPU cores, while the new model will reportedly include nine or 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AesMuF"&gt;The new MacBook Air is likely to follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, due to arrive in the third quarter of this year. The laptops will reportedly be available with 14 or 16-inch displays (Mini LED, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/09/kuo-redesigned-macbook-pro-coming-later-this-year-with-mini-led-macbook-air-with-new-display-in-2022/"&gt;according to Kuo&lt;/a&gt;) with a new, more squared off design. MagSafe charging, HDMI ports, and SD card slots, are also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said to be included&lt;/a&gt;. The MacBook Pro’s much derided OLED touch bar, could also finally be dropped with these models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 owners can get six months of Apple TV Plus for no charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKXJSPlEO5ks0eWMlVgy89haBL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69616772/acastro_191030_1777_appletvplus_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cKSeRI"&gt;Apple and Sony have teamed up to offer PS5 owners a great promotion on the Apple TV Plus streaming service. New and existing subscribers can get six months of service for no charge by simply opening the Apple TV Plus app on PS5 (and signing in with your Apple ID, if you aren’t a current user). After six months, you’ll be charged the normal rate of $4.99 per month to continue with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbML5k"&gt;The timing of this promotion is no coincidence. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, Apple TV Plus’ runaway hit show starring Jason Sudeikis, is beginning its second season Friday, July 23rd. There are other things to look forward to with this subscription, like catching up on two fantastic seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and getting ready for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;a promising-looking adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585674/jon-stewart-apple-tv-show-skit-roasting-space-billionaires-jason-alexander"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is launching in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZt7WV"&gt;If you have a PS5, this is a no-brainer. Tab over to the “Media” section on the main PS5 homescreen and download Apple TV Plus from there. The offer begins today and lasts through a year from now, giving you until July 22nd, 2022 to activate your six-month trial. You can see more details, terms, and eligible countries &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/6-months-trial-apple-tv-ps5-offer/"&gt;right here at the PlayStation website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDv2rg"&gt;Don’t have a PS5 yet? We know they’re still tough to find, but stay tuned for upcoming opportunities. Restocks will likely become more plentiful as we near the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing upvote and downvote buttons on tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_M1P-MIn06kHVxc6AYomsZa_Kk=/623x0:3473x1900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613644/E613I_0WEAQh4r0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBuV18"&gt;Twitter is working on new upvote and downvote reactions for tweets to accompany the usual options to retweet and reply. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?s=20"&gt;Twitter confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was testing the feature for a small group of users on iOS, and it’s already been spotted according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iglehart97/status/1417912630996574208?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danlopez016/status/1417913141397127168?s=20"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from users that are part of the test group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDaPM5"&gt;Twitter writes that iOS users may see upvote and downvotes in several different styles (up and down arrows, a heart icon and a down arrow, and thumbs up and thumbs down icons) and that it’s testing the feature to “understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them.” Currently votes are not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0fQh5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your downvotes aren’t public, while your upvotes will be shown as likes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hrBfrKQdcY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hrBfrKQdcY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqFZrD"&gt;While Twitter hasn’t said if it plans to add up and down voting as a permanent feature (or how voting affects what you see in your feed), there are clear parallels to be drawn to Reddit, which features upvoting and downvoting as a way of surfacing a subreddit’s favorite replies, responses, and posts. Twitter says that for now though upvotes and downvotes don’t impact the order of tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0GXxh"&gt;Twitter’s toyed with other kinds of tweet interactions in the past, including reactions that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;appeared to mimic the emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; Facebook uses for Facebook posts and Messenger messages. Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour has also said that the company planned to work on dislikes last year, saying the feature was “something we’re exploring” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?s=20"&gt;in response to a user’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5kWg4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction July 22nd, 8:45AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beykpour did not say dislikes were a “top priority” for Twitter last year; he said they were being explored. Other features, like addressing harassment, were listed as &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392"&gt;&lt;em&gt;top priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC pledges to fight unlawful right to repair restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfbtWGEnAjvFfrFzdf_YMqEGuRY=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613129/1232439143.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDOho7"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission formally pledged to take on unlawful “right to repair” restrictions in a new policy statement issued Wednesday. The new policy could spell trouble for smartphone manufacturers like Apple that strictly inhibit users’ abilities to repair their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nditej"&gt;Wednesday’s new right to repair policy statement commits the FTC to encouraging competition in product repair markets with “vigor,” according to Chair Lina Khan. The statement, which was approved unanimously, makes it official FTC policy for the agency to use its existing authorities to support independent repair shops and lower repair costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77QymA"&gt;“While efforts by dominant firms to restrict repair markets are not new, changes in technology and more prevalent use of software has created fresh opportunities for companies to limit independent repair,” Khan said Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1Iyl"&gt;The statement comes just days after the White House endorsed similar rules in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on economic competition. In the order, signed by President Joe Biden on July 9th, the White House explicitly calls out smartphone makers that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” At Wednesday’s meeting, the FTC did not name any specific companies or industries that it could target in future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2qAEj"&gt;The move was lauded by right to repair advocates like iFixit. In a statement Wednesday, iFixit’s US policy lead Kerry Sheehan said, “The FTC’s progress addressing repair restrictions shows how much momentum Right to Repair has achieved, and how powerful our community can be when we work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8wy9"&gt;“The adoption of today’s policy statement makes clear that the Commission will investigate unlawful repair restrictions, using the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and other consumer protection laws, as well as antitrust law to promote fair and open repair markets,” Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KImRzw"&gt;Wednesday’s open session was just the second since Khan was confirmed as chair at an agency that traditionally works behind closed doors. In the first proceeding earlier this month, Khan’s FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559131/ftc-open-meeting-antitrust-chair-lina-khan-sherman-act-powers"&gt;passed a pair of competition measures&lt;/a&gt;, setting the agency up to take more aggressive action on antitrust violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRBzO5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 7/21/21 at 3:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from iFixit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nobuo Uematsu’s beautiful Fantasian soundtrack is now on Apple Music</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="fantasian" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Mz7Ag417bBX1L7mAX_6kFXM5so=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611089/1_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7GvpnB"&gt;One of the most exciting things about &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;-style roleplaying game that debuted on Apple Arcade earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — was how it reunited two industry legends. Hironobu Sakaguchi served as the creative director of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;the handcrafted adventure&lt;/a&gt;, while longtime &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; composer Nobuo Uematsu returned for the soundtrack. Now, all of that beautiful music is finally available to stream on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Falbum%2F1576490134&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F21%2F22586744%2Ffantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Fl7x"&gt;It’s a hefty album, too, with 58 songs spanning more than two and half hours of music and a wide range of genres. Prior to &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s release, Uematsu said that he was worried this might be his last soundtrack. “Will I get another chance to work on an entire game?” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJR1wua8OJs"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “I didn’t want to have any regrets.” Sakaguchi expressed similar concerns, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Let’s be honest, I’m in the latter chapters of my game development career, and each game can take years to go from conception to release.”&lt;/p&gt;
