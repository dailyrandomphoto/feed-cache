    <title>New iPhone Health app feature gives doctors easier access to data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARrzlgjEHswkBGmAjj2X9sdU65g=/0x33:1629x1119/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428056/image__4_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone users will be able to share their Health app data directly with doctors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3fpuBY"&gt;People with smartphones and wearable devices regularly show up to the doctor’s office with readouts from apps detailing everything from their heart rate to sleep patterns. Now, with the new iOS 15 update this fall, some iPhone users will be able to send data directly from their Health app to their doctors’ electronic medical records systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPKuGC"&gt;That type of integration could make it easier for patients to share information with their doctors, said Libo Wang, a cardiology fellow at the University of Utah School of Medicine who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;studies wearables&lt;/a&gt;. “The current workflow is mildly laborious, and requires the patient to email the pdf, and a clinician manually uploading that file to create a permanent record in the official electronic medical record,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joIhNj"&gt;Users could already pull in data from the other direction: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176740/apple-health-records-app-ios-update"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has allowed people to add records from &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of clinics and hospitals to their Health app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf5K9k"&gt;The new integration will work with six electronic medical records companies in the United States. That includes Cerner, which controls around &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the market, and five smaller groups. Apple says it could continue to add more. Doctors who use the records from those companies would be able to open any shared data within a patient’s health record. The dashboard opens as a web view directly inside the record; it doesn’t take providers to another outside app. The design is similar within the records for each of the six companies, Apple says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUX3Js"&gt;The Health app data isn’t directly transferred into the electronic health record. Doctors can see a window with the data, but the information isn’t permanently added to the record. If an iPhone user decides to stop sharing their health data, none remains within the health record. The system is built using a framework called &lt;a href="https://smarthealthit.org/"&gt;SMART on FHIR&lt;/a&gt;, an open interface for third-party applications that can work within electronic health records. Any group can create an app using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfcajx"&gt;For physicians — and particularly cardiologists — direct access to iPhone data within health records could help them make more meaningful use of the information, Wang said. One &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044126?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that when physicians directly reviewed the strip generated by the Apple Watch that visually shows a user’s heart rate, they were able to flag more cases of abnormal heart rhythms than the Watch’s algorithm flagged. If the rhythm strips are shared directly to someone’s doctor, the doctor might be able to identify any concerning patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UF1Tvv"&gt;The downside, though, is the potential for information overload, Wang said. More data isn’t necessarily better, particularly if doctors don’t trust its accuracy. While the data collected by wearables and smartphones may seem helpful to patients, it’s still not entirely clear if it actually helps people feel better or gives them better care, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIn4Hz"&gt;Cerner, one of the electronic health record companies participating in the initial rollout, was able to test the new Apple feature at its onsite clinic for employees. “Having secure ways to view and share this information in a clinical context has been helpful,” said Sam Lambson, vice president of interoperability at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beMShQ"&gt;It’s more and more common for patients to bring health data from their personal devices to health visits, and Lambson said Cerner is focused on efforts to incorporate that into its systems even outside of the new Apple program. One advantage of the Apple system is that it’s easy for doctors to use, said Jessica Oveys, director of product management at Cerner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3ovFu"&gt;“I think the key to it is certainly empowering and making the patient feel at the center and secure, and making it easy for them to share. But also, it’s really presenting the data in a way that’s actionable and relevant to the clinician,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDhmVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB0FTa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1gYZtMLk1bB46AsGjCUQv1egAwY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427941/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At launch, it’s a very hit or miss experience&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="AQSssp"&gt;Late on Monday night, Apple flipped the switch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;two new features for its Apple Music subscription service&lt;/a&gt;: immersive Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming. It feels like the company is really only excited about one of them, though, and it’s not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N07Cwb"&gt;Eddy Cue is Apple’s senior vice president of services and the person who oversees Apple Music. He &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9583947/apple-music-eddy-cue-spatial-audio-lossless-future-of-music/"&gt;didn’t mince words when he told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the sudden proliferation of lossless audio isn’t going to significantly evolve or change how we listen to music. “There’s no question it’s not going to be lossless,” he said when asked about what technologies will bring about the “next-gen” of music streaming. Cue firmly stands on the side of the crowd that argues most people can’t hear any difference between CD-quality or hi-res tracks and the AAC or MP3 files that’ve been filling their ears for so long now. He did acknowledge that the higher-bit rate tracks might matter to music lovers with particularly sharp hearing or premium audio equipment, but he was also direct about how niche that group is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKCf33"&gt;“The reality of lossless is: if you take 100 people and you take a stereo song in lossless and you take a song that’s been in Apple Music that’s compressed, I don’t know if it’s 99 or 98 can’t tell the difference.” Cue revealed that he has regularly done blind tests with the Apple Music team, and they confirm how rare it is for anyone to be able to consistently recognize lossless audio. “You can tell somebody, ‘Oh, you’re listening to a lossless [song],’ and they tell you, ‘Oh, wow. That sounds incredible.’ They’re just saying it because you told them it’s lossless and it sounds like the right thing to say, but you just can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKbQBn"&gt;If you go by the message that Cue and Apple are pushing, the Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio feature is where the true breakthrough is. “When I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for music what HD did for television,” Cue said in the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; interview. And then he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; went in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UAmSeJ"&gt;“I think this is going to take over everything. It’s the way I want to listen to music when I’m in my car. It’s going to be the way I listen to music immediately with my AirPods. It’s going to be the way I listen to music in my house. In a way, it won’t feel very good when I’m listening to something that’s not Dolby Atmos because it’s so good. It’s like when I’m watching HD, it’s hard to go back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eqX3h9"&gt;“This requires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit back and listen, and really make the right calls and what the right things to do are,” Cue told &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; about mixing for spatial audio. “It’s a process that takes time, but it’s worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5rpOU"&gt;Problem is, with much of the Dolby Atmos content on Apple Music I’ve sampled so far, it doesn’t seem like everyone is making those right calls. It’s a hit-or-miss game of exploration, and songs that truly showcase the immersive potential of Atmos are more often the exception than the rule. In many cases, spatial audio tracks have an artificial wideness to them, unfamiliar placement of vocals and instrumentation, and just sound… &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. Distant? Too reverb-y? Pick your preferred interpretation. Yet, Apple is so confident in Apple Music’s spatial audio that essentially overnight it became the default for millions of customers listening with AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nue23S"&gt;But let’s back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xXic1j"&gt;What is spatial audio supposed to do for music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11yuxN"&gt;In a word, it’s all about immersion. Here’s how Cue hyped it: “it makes you feel like you’re onstage, standing right next to the singer, it makes you feel like you might be to the left of the drummer, to the right of the guitarist.” On its website, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; “music created in Dolby Atmos is freed from channels, allowing artists to place individual sounds all around you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfUQw4"&gt;Whoa there. Like all of Apple’s senior executives, Eddy Cue knows how to pitch something. But if you slap on your AirPods and expect to feel like an invisible person standing in the middle of a recording session, you’ll probably be underwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RCDpv"&gt;When it’s done well, spatial audio does indeed give music a unique feeling of breadth. And it’s in a different way than a high-end pair of headphones might bring the most out of a stereo track’s soundstage. In particular, vocals often have a very distinct placement in the mix and cut through better than on traditional stereo tracks. That’s the most consistent advantage I’ve noticed with spatial audio music. But because of the different mix, you’ll very likely also pick up on details or sounds that ordinarily don’t stand out in the regular version of a song. And on the best Atmos tracks, everything has a lot more room to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw13aL"&gt;But when engineers don’t put much care into an Atmos mix, it really shows. Sometimes giving everything so much space can take the impact or crunch out of guitars. Or other aspects of a track fall flat. I’ve included just a few samples below where the spatial audio version of a song is an obvious downgrade from the original. But there are many, and when you hit a few in a row where the vocals sound weird or something’s amiss, it can detract from the listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B3ZRod"&gt;How many songs are available in Dolby Atmos spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WmlWUp"&gt;Apple currently isn’t providing a hard number, and is instead only saying that “thousands” of tracks are available with spatial audio at launch, with many more on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uBiKGJ"&gt;How do I know when I’m hearing spatial audio on Apple Music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="23SBGz"&gt;You’ll see either a Dolby Atmos or Dolby Audio logo appear on the Now Playing screen beneath the album artwork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o4yEjZ"&gt;A few random, good examples of Apple Music spatial audio:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="z57G7e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fdont-know-why%2F728317060%3Fi%3D728317110&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Don’t Know Why” by Norah Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— This is one where I nearly buy into Cue’s description. Close your eyes, and you could almost transport yourself to a small club where the spread of this mix feels like a live version of Jones’ career-making hit. Stereo doesn’t take you to the same place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPvVgB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fpaparazzi%2F1440818588%3Fi%3D1440818663&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Paparazzi” by Lady Gaga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — With a very surround sound-esque mix (skip to the second verse at 1:23 for the best examples), this is a great example of an old pop hit with an excellent spatial audio treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3pUlD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fboom%2F1445039970%3Fi%3D1445039972&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Boom” by Tiësto and Sevenn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — A fun, lively track that does give off a nice surround sound effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2NlV7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fblack-skinhead%2F1440873068%3Fi%3D1440873230&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Black Skinhead” by Kanye West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This one is another good example of the “beyond two-channel” openness that spatial audio can provide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj4mdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A whole lot of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fjazz-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.efbd24628ff04ff3b5e416a6e237d753&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Fplaylist%2Fclassical-in-spatial-audio%2Fpl.ffea4bbea2d141cbb0ec67e32059b278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;classical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — If there are two genres that naturally lend themselves to spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, it’s jazz and classical. Orchestras can sound truly massive, and it’s a captivating way to listen to jazz ensembles where it’s easy to hear even the quietest notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x9Wd0G"&gt;Other examples where it just sounds wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LRYDOh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbuddy-holly%2F1440878798%3Fi%3D1440879325&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Buddy Holly” by Weezer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — The guitars basically lose all life in this mix and vocals dominate the entire thing in a way that just sounds strange and bad. And yet this song is on Apple’s own playlist meant to showcase Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zd7B49"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Ffollow-your-arrow%2F1440858493%3Fi%3D1440858612&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Follow Your Arrow” by Kacey Musgraves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— Apple mentioned Musgraves as an artist to check out with Atmos. And while her most recent album &lt;em&gt;Golden Hour&lt;/em&gt; sounds… fine… her breakthrough &lt;em&gt;Same Trailer Different Park&lt;/em&gt; is pretty rough in spatial audio format. “Follow Your Arrow” seems to lose most of its background vocals, and even the main guitar melody is way quieter here than in the regular mix. It almost comes off like a demo recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJDOwx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fwhats-my-age-again%2F1440839912%3Fi%3D1440840493&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“What’s My Age Again?” by Blink 182&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — This is another song that Apple seems to think makes spatial audio sound good, but I’d strongly argue it does the opposite. Mark Hoppus’ muffled vocals legitimately sound like they were recorded through a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zkCdc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Falex-chilton%2F698654479%3Fi%3D698654487&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Alex Chilton” by The Replacements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Is that enough cowbell for you during the chorus? It overpowers everything else and makes me feel like I’m in the old Christopher Walken &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; skit, only with a different band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2qTZ2"&gt;I’m curious to hear some of your examples that sound great, and others you’ve found that are a disappointment with Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NQHaSb"&gt;Do I need AirPods or Beats headphones for Apple Music spatial audio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i47rdV"&gt;No. Apple Music’s spatial audio works on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCk9sW"&gt;All headphones and earbuds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICjX4a"&gt;The loudspeakers on supported iPhones, iPads, and Macs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2KknA7"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qc9Feh"&gt;If you set Dolby Atmos to “always on” in settings for the Music app, you’ll see a pop-up advising that it probably won’t sound right on all speakers, but Apple Music will still play the spatial audio mix if that’s your preference. In fact, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182"&gt;Apple clearly states&lt;/a&gt; that you can “listen on any headphones” to Apple Music’s spatial audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V229ep"&gt;How do I turn off Apple Music spatial audio if I don’t like it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5x0IvE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iOS and iPadOS:&lt;/strong&gt; Go to Settings &amp;gt; Music &amp;gt; Dolby Atmos (under “audio”), and there you can pick between automatic, always on, and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PekaN7"&gt;If you’d prefer to leave Atmos on by default but want to quickly switch to a regular stereo version of any song that’s playing, just pull down Control Center, press and hold on the volume slider, and toggle off spatial audio. Apple Music will switch over to stereo. If you turn spatial audio back on, you’ll return to the Atmos track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Houvwm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;macOS: &lt;/strong&gt;In the Music app, open preferences and select the “playback” tab. Halfway down you’ll see an “audio quality” section and Atmos is in there. You get the same three automatic / always on / off choices as on Apple’s mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZeqbWk"&gt;Head tracking is coming to Apple Music spatial audio this fall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvFcb"&gt;Apple Music’s spatial audio is currently much different than the spatial audio experience you get when watching movies and TV shows on an iPhone or iPad. For videos, Apple includes a head-tracking feature that adjusts the sound placement as you turn your head to keep it anchored to the source device. This trick is exclusive to the AirPods lineup, but it’s a very impressive effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wONQz3"&gt;Apple has said it plans to bring this sound-changes-as-you-turn-your-head feature to Apple Music in the fall — likely with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="83be3G"&gt;Is this just a gimmick?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JqTPw8"&gt;That’s really the question that remains to be answered. But Apple isn’t alone in hyping multidimensional music (nor is it the first to do so). Amazon, Tidal, and others are also increasingly pushing the experience. I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;reviewed an extravagant Sony speaker&lt;/a&gt; that positions 360-degree audio as its main selling point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIKRc0"&gt;Are people like Eddy Cue and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-musics-zane-lowe-explains-how-spatial-audio-will-transform-music%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22525028%2Fapple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zane Lowe&lt;/a&gt; right in their insistence that spatial audio will revolutionize how we consume music in the same way that stereo did? Or is this a gimmick like 3D TVs that will fizzle out and be forgotten within a few years? If it’s going to be the former, it’ll take a lot of work and creativity from artists, producers, and mixers to make this format shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92rz3E"&gt;Because right now, for every Atmos spatial audio track that’s a standout on Apple Music, there are a dozen others that are quite meh — or worse than in stereo. We’re still in the early days, and now that Atmos is officially part of Apple Music, hopefully the consistency will improve. When you do find those mixes where they totally nail it, it’s something special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tKT9hC"&gt;Apple should make it easier to switch between Atmos and stereo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jV8qIF"&gt;But in the meantime, and to avoid turning people &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; from Atmos when they land on a lackluster mix, Apple Music should make it easier to go back and forth between spatial audio and regular stereo tracks on a per-song basis. One solution could be displaying a choice when you tap on the Dolby icon, similar to the “go to artist / album” options that appear when tapping on an artist’s name. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the developer beta of iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGHU86pLQ0nPVQUSouD_cYsx_uE=/76x0:1885x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69427177/apple_live_text.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gCRRF5"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;much-anticipated WWDC session&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 7th, Apple introduced a load of new features for its upcoming update of its iOS mobile operating system: iOS 15. The developer’s beta is now available for anyone who’d like to download it — and who is a registered developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXuH7Q"&gt;First, the obligatory warning: this version of iOS 15 is going to be very new and very beta. If you’re a developer, you know all this, but it’s worth repeating: it’s best to install this on a phone that isn’t the one that you rely on. In addition, remember that Backups Are Your Friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="81kWuD"&gt;You can find the developers beta of iOS 15 on &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/"&gt;Apple’s Developers Website&lt;/a&gt;. You will, of course, have to sign in (we’re assuming you’ve paid your $99 for a developer’s account). You may be asked to register your device if it isn’t registered already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NiJBjy"&gt;Find the iOS 15 profile by choosing Downloads (either from the button on the upper right corner, or by using the two-line drop-down menu on the upper left).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxypZu"&gt;Look for the iOS profile, and allow the download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Uk9rC"&gt;Once the profile is downloaded, go to the Settings on your device, find “Profile Downloaded,” and follow the instructions. You will eventually be told to reboot, and then should be able to install the update that is available in Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MmG9Dh"&gt;If you’re not enrolled as an Apple developer, don’t be downhearted — there will be a public beta available for download sometime in July. When it’s available, we’ll let you know where to find it and how to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSkEdx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em7HR0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSRbsl"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAVqQV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max update fixes the worst of its Apple TV woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ShSffe4iCzq3nBcS3gixmzmCj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426541/wjoel_200527_1777_hbomax_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEKmLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come. Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— HBOMaxHelp (@HBOMaxHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uA2VlS"&gt;Although the worst of the issues appear to have been fixed, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;HBOMax subreddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that some bugs remain after the new update. One user reports that they’re finding their subtitles keep &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/h14cg1l?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reverting back to Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Thankfully, as another user has pointed out, the new update makes it easier to switch subtitles back, a process which the previous update had made &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly#:~:text=turning%20on%2Foff%20subtitles%20requires%20pressing%20pause%2C%20swiping%20down%20then%20across%20to%20subtitles%2C%20pressing%20again%20then%20scrolling%20to%20your%20desired%20option%2C%20pressing%20yet%20again%20then%20resuming%20playback.%20before%2C%20you%20could%20swipe%20down%2C%20select%20your%20choice%2C%20then%20swipe%20up%20again%20-%20the%20standard%20tvos%20way."&gt;significantly more difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXzQuQ"&gt;Questions remain about how such broken software was able to be released to users in the first place. Responding to a tweet from &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Nilay Patel, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager Andy Forssell admitted that this was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;” and that the company would be investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max has been busted for days </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMhD-qZm5Fgljs7YY1kaw_O9nPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425659/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0tRNJ"&gt;If you’ve attempted to stream something on HBO Max from an Apple TV sometime during the last several days, you may have noticed that its player controls are unusable. It’s not just you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqDmgf"&gt;Ongoing issues seem to be related to an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-tv-movies/id971265422"&gt;app update&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly addressed “a few bugs lurking around” on June 5th. Since that update released, users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that basic playback functionality — such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and pausing — is borked completely when you try to use the service on an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POJuAO"&gt;How an update this riddled with bugs rolled out to consumers remains unclear. Unfortunately, it’s also unclear when exactly they’re going to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3P1rU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There’s legitimately no way to pause, rewind or fast forward on the HBO Max app no matter if you use the apple remote or the remote mobile app. Idk how anyone is watching anything on there&lt;/p&gt;— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIQWY"&gt;Asked for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was working to fix the issue “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8wi12"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief Nilay Patel tweeted about the issue, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401771759641055244"&gt;Andy Forssell replied&lt;/a&gt; that the company was undertaking “one whale of an effort to address this with app updates as soon as humanly possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8iuUh"&gt;“You’ll hear no excuses from us,” Forssell added, “fixes coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZP1rz"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1401883622089674752"&gt;when asked&lt;/a&gt; by Patel how it was possible that the update shipped to users with broken playback controls, the HBO Max head said that was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="60k69f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reckless&lt;/a&gt; That's the zillion dollar question. First priority is to deliver for users in addressing the issues, but in parallel we will also dive deep into that question. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Forssell (@aforssell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2i5x"&gt;On Twitter, the HBO Max help account is replying directly to frustrated users. “We’re aware that our recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HBOMax?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; app update for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV"&gt;@AppleTV&lt;/a&gt; led to a number of issues for our viewers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402409361461460993"&gt;the account said in one tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Our team is working quickly to restore the experience you’re used to. We appreciate your patience and will provide updates as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gX9MN"&gt;Separately, on Friday,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the service about reported issues affecting the new Siri Remote’s scrubbing feature — though that issue was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519340/siri-remote-scrubbing-feature-disney-plus"&gt;not limited to just HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a spokesperson said that it was aware of player control issues as well as “a few isolated reports” of HDR playback problems. But the spokesperson also added that the company did not believe the HDR issues were related to an update, as the most recent update at the time did not include changes to the video player itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5Z0L"&gt;Given the problems with the app right now, if you were hoping to stream the &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; finale on your Apple TV box without issue, you may want to hold off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XsQAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 9th, 3:52AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; HBO Max has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525635/hbo-max-apple-tv-app-update-native-tvos-player-fixed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;released an update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for its Apple TV app which users are reporting fixes many of the issues detailed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple end the newsletter boom?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RD0R-lkFZ-_jO5BAwDNoqO6YZZw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425567/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can collect about you. Here’s how the company describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aGxsdc"&gt;In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6x6I6C"&gt;When you eventually update your iPhone to iOS 15 this fall, you’ll see a screen at launch that invites you to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mUonCX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;iOS 15: First launch of Mail app. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W4ewu9XFCk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W4ewu9XFCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401993816001978375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="04KYBc"&gt;Let’s assume most Apple Mail users opt in. How necessary is this data to building email-based businesses? Over the past day I’ve read and heard lots of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56SUVK"&gt;Some quick background for the non-email obsessives. Long ago, email marketers began including invisible pixels in the emails they send you; when you open their messages, those pixels load, telling the sender that you read their message, and might also infer your location from your IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGydg"&gt;Collectively, the percentage of people that actually open emails is known as the open rate, and it’s one of the most important metrics that senders measure to gauge the effectiveness of what they’re doing. It gives you a sense of how engaged your audience is, and how that engagement is changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYikKE"&gt;At the same time, there is a fairly long tradition of people finding this creepy. The email startup Superhuman &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/superhuman-founder-apology-email-tracking-spyware-backlash-2019-7"&gt;had to apologize in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after a viral blog post explained how the company tracked when, where, and how often people opened emails sent through its service. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, a nonprofit newsroom that often focuses on issues of data privacy, turned down eight potential email providers &lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/themarkup/issues/hello-from-the-markup-199187"&gt;before finding one that would agree to turn off tracking capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFJtaC"&gt;Last year, when Basecamp launched the email service Hey, it made the blocking of tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;a marquee feature&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog post today, Basecamp cofounder David Heinemeier Hansson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;no fan of Apple in general&lt;/a&gt;! — declared victory against tracking pixels. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfxG3V"&gt;Given Apple’s monopoly advantage with their preinstalled Mail app, we don’t need much of an uptake from what they’re calling Mail Privacy Protection to break the dam on spy pixels. You can’t really say anything authoritatively about open rates if 5-10-30-50% of your recipients are protected against snooping, as you won’t know whether that’s why your spy pixel isn’t tripping, or it’s because they’re just not opening your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfvbxc"&gt;There’s also simply no way users are going to willingly accept the premise of spy pixels if Apple presents the privacy dangers as clearly and as honestly as we’ve done in HEY. Apple already showed that with their drive to block unique ad identifiers for cross-app tracking in iOS 14.5: &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/targeted-ads-are-staggeringly-unpopular-so-we-should-ban-them-01c13a9c"&gt;96% of users in the US have declined to let apps track them like that!&lt;/a&gt; And email spy pixels are far worse and much creepier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8DWPeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rZR9KN"&gt;Let’s stipulate a few things up front. One, most people still don’t know that these spy pixels exist. Two, if they did, most people probably wouldn’t allow them if given the choice. Three, the majority of these spy pixels are used for marketing purposes — efforts to target you better for e-commerce. I do not think it is at all irrational to look at the state of affairs the way Apple did, and say to hell with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x66xXB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAJgjU"&gt;At the same time, email-based publishing has been of the few bright spots for journalism in recent years. (Certainly it has been a bright spot for me!) Media companies from Facebook to Twitter to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; are now investing heavily in newsletter strategies; new email-based publishers are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/40-north-tpg-digital-media-startup-funding-69eacb52-1ff8-42ba-8742-32b36d762d3c.html"&gt;popping up seemingly every week&lt;/a&gt;. Much of this has come in the wake of the success of Substack, which I use to publish Platformer (&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;see disclosure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3vav"&gt;And so it’s no surprise that some observers look at Mail Privacy Protection and see a threat. “This is another sign that Apple’s war against targeted advertising isn’t just about screwing Facebook,” Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/a-packed-set-of-apple-announcements-could-have-big-impacts-on-news-publishers-for-good-and-for-ill/"&gt;wrote in Nieman Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also coming for your Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTtW8"&gt;Benton brings some powerful numbers to buttress his worries: “The &lt;a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-may-2021/"&gt;most recent market-share numbers from Litmus&lt;/a&gt;, for May 2021, &lt;em&gt;93.5%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens on phones come in Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads,” he writes. “On desktop, Apple Mail on Mac is responsible for &lt;em&gt;58.4%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5xrPG"&gt;It seems clear that Apple’s move to cut off granular customer data from email senders will affect the email economy. But after conversations with newsletter writers and media executives today, I’m not sure that people doing email-based journalism have all that much to worry about from the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJYHGc"&gt;“The advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking, prioritizing bottom of the funnel metrics at the expense of great content and creative. It’s tragic,” said Alex Kantrowitz, author of the free, ad-supported newsletter &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (He previously covered the industry for &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;.) “And it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BORsUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu5mu5"&gt;Kantrowitz told me that his ad inventory was sold out for the first half of the year, thanks to a premium audience he identified not by pixel-based tracking but by a good old-fashioned reader survey. (&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, too, has used reader surveys to build a picture of its user base.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTGZAX"&gt;“Pixel blocking makes placements like this more valuable and gives quality email newsletters a leg up on the junk clogging most people’s inboxes,” Kantrowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPBUQp"&gt;For ad-based newsletters, then, Mail Privacy Protection is likely to spur publishers to find other ways to understand their audiences. But what about paid newsletters, like the one this column is syndicated from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vz8d"&gt;Apple’s move may affect reader-supported newsletters even less, publishing industry executives told me today. Writers can triangulate reader engagement by plenty of metrics that are still available to them, including the views their stories get on the web, the overall growth of their mailing list, and — most meaningful of all — the growth of their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OiZpQ"&gt;The media business changes so quickly that I don’t find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one Apple made this week and assume it will be bad for journalism. But in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm. There are any number of changes that major email providers including Apple, Google, and Microsoft could make that would make life more difficult for newsletter-based businesses. In the end, though, I don’t think blocking spy pixels is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xce2am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="99mWAK"&gt;All that said, I can’t end without pointing out the ways in which Apple itself benefits from cracking down on email data collection. The first one is obvious: it further burnishes the company’s privacy credentials, part of an ongoing and incredibly successful public-relations campaign to build user trust during a time of collapsing faith in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o30tbg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1Ndb"&gt;Taken together, the numerous iOS 15 features focused on user privacy combine to place more pressure on the digital ad ecosystem. Perhaps most notably, “Private Relay” — available to paying subscribers of Apple’s iCloud+ service — will encrypt all traffic leaving a user’s device, making them harder for advertisers to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8ePgs"&gt;One of my more cynical friends views all this as a way to funnel more businesses to building apps, offering in-app purchases, and promoting them with Apple’s advertising products. Marketing emails not working as well as they used to? Sounds like it’s time to buy some keywords in the App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCet5h"&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model? Apple will be there, ready and waiting to take a 30 percent cut of Twitter Super Follows, paid podcasts, and ticketed Facebook events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xdt6y"&gt;It’s sometimes said that Amazon’s ultimate goal is to take a cut of all economic activity. Looking at Apple’s privacy moves this week, I’m mostly willing to take them at face value — as a necessary counter-balance to the inexorable rise of tracking technologies around the web. But it also seems clear that the value to Apple goes far beyond customer satisfaction — and as its revenues from ads and in-app purchases grow, we’d do well to keep an eye on how its policies are gradually reshaping the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Q0E8Sa"&gt;
&lt;p id="pEjYP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple brought back the beloved magnifying glass for selecting text in iOS 15</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJNnS9HAWzSLl1uJNOW2sgwHw_s=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424709/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it used to look like, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs"&gt;a great demonstration here&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s at least better than the nothing that appears in iOS 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaRxtd8kO_pa_upcMuglfrFOUiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645890/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_12.51.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The feature listing on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Did we not want to select exactly the text we wanted before?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88e77i"&gt;It will, at the very least, solve the biggest problem with the current selection system: that your thumb is covering the text you’re trying to select, which makes it &lt;em&gt;a little difficult&lt;/em&gt; to see what’s being selected until you pick your thumb up from the screen. Then, if you’re like me, you’ll probably sigh seeing that the wrong thing is selected, then struggle with the text selection handles to try to highlight what you were actually going for (squinting at the small screen the whole time).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqoiEOLf3_erOksYOeME5AXIfyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645992/ios_14_selection_woes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It isn’t always this bad, but iOS 14’s text selection leaves something to be desired (and that something is a magnifier).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6t59P"&gt;iOS 15 is currently in early beta, so anything we see now is subject to change — Apple could always make the magnifying glass more prominent based on feedback, if it seems like a lot of people are still struggling. While this feature isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for me to risk downloading the first developer beta, I think it may be what gets me to immediately grab the first public beta when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The six-year-old iPhone 6S will get iOS 15, and that rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bBUoFOzgTMz04ihhp5021RnhETM=/196x0:2305x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424126/iphone_6s_plus_clean_2_7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus arrived in September 2015 running iOS 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1ydGZS"&gt;The iPhone 6S will turn six years old this September, an eternity in phone years. If you’ve managed to hold onto one this long, then Apple has some good news for you — your phone will be eligible for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; when it arrives for the public this fall. The iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and first-generation iPhone SE, which all shipped with iOS 9, will be among the oldest devices to receive the OS update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUWzSX"&gt;Six years is an awfully long life span for a mobile device, and certainly puts the 6S in the running for the longest supported phone to date. The iPhone 5S was five years old when it got its last OS update with iOS 12 but wasn’t eligible for iOS 13. On the Android side, Samsung has made recent moves to improve its device longevity by offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;four years of security support&lt;/a&gt; for some of its phones. But six years of OS updates and security support puts the 6S in an entirely different league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAuOLa"&gt;To be sure, there are a lot of new features that won’t work with the 6S’s A9 Bionic processor. Features like the Google Lens-esque Visual Lookup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; in photos, portrait mode in FaceTime, and immersive walking directions in Maps won’t be available to 6S users, since they all require a device with an A12 Bionic chip a la the XS and XR or later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vw84SQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6J0gyt"&gt;It’s also possible that newer software will slow down an older phone with an aging, less nimble processor. That might not necessarily be the case, though — both &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-14-on-the-iphone-6s-and-se-performance-is-fine-other-stuff-is-not/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ios14-older-iphones-3795531/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found no significant impact on performance running iOS 14 on the 6S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lS5T8p"&gt;What may be a bigger issue, as both testers noted, is that the 6S shows its age with poor battery life. Features like widgets are also tougher to use on the phone’s 4.7-inch screen, which is quaint compared to today’s standard six-inch-plus panels. These aren’t so much compatibility issues as the inevitable, slow march of time that no gadget can escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMJ1dL"&gt;iPhone 6S owners shouldn’t despair, though. They’ll still get potentially useful updates like notification summaries and Focus modes to minimize interruptions throughout the day, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;video and music sharing&lt;/a&gt; in FaceTime, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;added privacy features&lt;/a&gt; like a seven-day app privacy report to keep tabs on how apps are using your information. There’s also the peace of mind that comes with running the latest OS version, and the security patches and bug fixes that come with it throughout the year. Not a bad deal for a six-year-old device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Screen Time to keep your iPhone use within healthy limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9j9UYVViDxjCj-v3bXiMEjYOLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424084/bfarsace_201106_4269_026.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71fUVO"&gt;We all spend a lot of time on our phones, and it’s possible — just possible — that some of us spend too much time. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;we ran an article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to use what was then Apple’s brand-new Screen Time feature, which was built in order to help people keep their on-screen time in some sort of sane proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g5Gbf"&gt;At the time (which was when iOS 12 came out), you could use Screen Time to check how much time you spent on your phone, use an App Limits feature to limit your (or your kids’) daily time spent on various apps or types of apps, or use its Downtime feature to cut off access to all (except a few) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odVZMI"&gt;Since then, and especially since iOS 13 came out, Screen Time has been expanded, making it easier to lock down apps and / or limit your screentime. (There have been no additional features announced so far for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;the upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll add them here if there are.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRN1jS"&gt;To begin using Screen Time, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time.” Here are some of the things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m2VTij"&gt;Daily Average&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pmiNMf"&gt;At the top of the Screen Time app, you can see an accounting of your activity over the course of the day. Click on “See All Activity” to see a breakdown of which specific apps you used and how long you used them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggA_yQU7yRGAjbRvvMF5Oyct128=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645210/IMG_5AFD8368F3A3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Screen Time screen is accessible from your Settings menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1PUC2UJiLMEeGJQvp2iQ6NVrKWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645212/IMG_B722454A795A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screen Time lets you know how long you’ve been on your phone, and with which apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9a4phx"&gt;Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr76BG"&gt;Downtime lets you set periods when you want to force yourself to give your eyes a rest and avoid staring at the screen. It does this by locking down the apps with which you are most likely to spend time. These lockdowns are not absolute — as you’ll see later, you can cancel Downtime when you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztlSvG"&gt;Begin by choosing when you want to start your time away from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jGPz2g"&gt;Tap on “Downtime” and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ULynqq"&gt;Select the days (it can be every day or just on specific days) and times that you want to avoid getting swallowed by your favorite iPhone apps. During those times, only specified apps that you pre-selected (along with phone calls) will be allowed through. For example, you can disable Facebook and Twitter during working hours, but keep the Messages app going for texts. (We’ll go over how to choose which apps to disable in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6xpbLB"&gt;You’ll get a warning before Downtime kicks in. If you need to keep working on an app, don’t worry — you’ll be given the chance to ask for one more minute, to be reminded in another 15 minutes, or to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set Downtime for everyday or specific days, and for set times for each day" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdFBe_H4X6SF5P9swk0plrwrUus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645426/IMG_5D6CBD759B26_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set Downtime for every day or specific days, and for set times for each day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pADXaUsGVY4ryDYQtUOAo0mAl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645432/IMG_9FECEC603727_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps can be flagged as always allowed, even during Downtime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbF9r"&gt;Keep in mind that Downtime, and the other Screen Time features, can be applied to all your devices that use iCloud. So if you set it on your iPhone, for example, it can apply to your Mac or iPad as well. To share your settings across your devices, go to the Screen Time main screen and toggle “Share Across Devices” on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyrjeu"&gt;Now that you’ve chosen &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you want some downtime, you’ll probably want to select &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; apps should be allowed to remain active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dtarU"&gt;Back in the Screen Time main screen, select “Always Allowed.” Here you can choose which apps you will still have access to during downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cuuooE"&gt;You’ll see two sets of apps: Allowed Apps and Choose Apps. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifFL5P"&gt;To select an app you’ll always want access to, even during downtime, tap on the app’s name in Choose Apps and it will appear in the Allowed Apps list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w2QVxh"&gt;If you want to disallow any of the Allowed Apps, tap on the minus sign next to the app, and then on “Remove.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FqNQvs"&gt;There are more ways to personalize Downtime. Let’s say you want to get alerted about text messages from specific people — you’re planning to concentrate on a project and don’t want to hear from any of your friends, but you still want to get texts from family members. You can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SDiM1O"&gt;On the same “Always Allowed” page, tap on “Contacts” at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElBJnY"&gt;Under “Allowed Communication,” select “Specific Contacts” and choose which contacts you want to allow through, even during downtime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2NpCxn"&gt;Note that the “Allowed Communication” page is also accessible from the main Screen Time page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gpVsFE"&gt;App Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WJAgoC"&gt;Another way to keep your app use in check is to limit the amount of time you use an app (rather than setting what time of day you can use it). For example, if Twitter tends to be your personal black hole, you can decide not to spend more than, say, two hours on Twitter each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxdU0L"&gt;To set your app limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D2hPC7"&gt;In the Screen Time screen, select “App Limits” &amp;gt; “Add Limit.” Toggle “App Limits” on and tap on “Add Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4taRzN"&gt;You’ll see a list of categories, such as “Social,” “Games,” and “Entertainment.” Tap on a specific category, and it will open up to show a list of all your apps that are in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HVgNG7TqpIvA2ZJEajF91Ze8Ts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645260/IMG_0AC0E116FFC1_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To limit the amount of time you use an app, select App Limits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can limit specific apps or a category of apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVuQKZnLTu1F-8KNNgr9lDJ8oSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645257/IMG_476F28DD6A3A_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can limit specific apps or a category of apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hSDXif"&gt;Select the apps that you want to limit — or select an entire category to choose all the apps in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dcKdTv"&gt;Tap on “Next” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L3Mu3i"&gt;Select the maximum amount of time you can use the app(s) on a daily basis. When you reach your limit, you’ll be interrupted by a screen that lets you either apply the limit (just tap on the “OK” button), or shrug and select “Ignore Limit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ymh75o"&gt;If you choose the latter, you can get one more minute, ask to be reminded in 15 minutes, or decide to ignore the limit for today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose how much time you want to spend on an app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKfJy4XokyLHBVGjX8EnbofR02c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645275/IMG_63420372C935_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose how much time you want to spend on an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time, or ignore it altogether." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-qXntlLlTVEGUdOsPRZCtrWWpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645285/IMG_7424C1B86747_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you hit your time limit, you can ask for more time or ignore it altogether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r6JZtS"&gt;Note: if for any reason you don’t want to use an app at all, except for on rare occasions, you can set the Screen Time to 23 hours and 59 minutes. The app will then be out of reach unless you go back into “Settings” &amp;gt; “Screen Time” &amp;gt; “App Limits” and disable the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dvoc84"&gt;Screen Time Passcode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tDNcaj"&gt;If you want to keep certain apps out of the reach of your kids — or your roommate — then you can create a passcode that will be needed to make any changes to Screen Time. The passcode is also useful if you feel you need an extra barrier before you undo one of your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1NcJMg"&gt;Go to Screen Time and tap on “Use Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FS0GOB"&gt;Set a four-digit passcode, and then reenter it when asked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsAy9X"&gt;Enter your Apple ID and password so that you can use it if you’ve forgotten your passcode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uVVIrR"&gt;And that’s it. If you want to change or delete your passcode, go back to Screen Time and select “Change Screen Time Passcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LN0t9l"&gt;Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="carjbn"&gt;The last selection in Screen Time isn’t as much concerned with when you use your iPhone as with what you see or hear on it. Select “Content &amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions” if you want to allow or restrict explicit content, keep TV shows or movies to certain ratings, set an age limit for apps, limit which websites are allowed, and set a number of different limits on games (such as multiplayer games, connecting with friends, or private messaging). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql5dhD"&gt;Most of this is geared toward parents who want to oversee what their kids see and hear online, but if you’d rather avoid accidentally crashing into any “adult” websites, it could be useful. There are also a number of privacy features, such as stopping Apple advertising, or not allowing apps to change the settings of your microphone, Bluetooth sharing, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Content &amp;amp;amp; Privacy Restrictions” lets you place limitations on a number of apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ApoXL3KbOgBMJtf56Hk96Rpjy0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645592/IMG_4C30F18FCA17_1.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>macOS and tvOS are getting spatial audio support with the AirPods Pro and Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cldvICuW5DevDXGBeqxPhGZAFA8=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423054/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_10.48.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbWXbF"&gt;Apple is extending support for spatial audio to macOS and tvOS. The feature will work with the company’s high-end AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, using the devices’ built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes to create a 3D audio effect that tracks the listener’s head movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KziSGB"&gt;Apple initially announced spatial audio for the AirPods Pro last year and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;impressed us with the feature’s immersive quality&lt;/a&gt;. At this year’s WWDC, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;extended support for spatial audio to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjAYV5"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fmacos-monterey-introduces-powerful-features-to-get-more-done%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22523914%2Fmacos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, spatial audio for macOS will only work with the AirPods Pro and Max on Macs with the company’s latest M1 chip and the macOS Monterey operating system. During this week’s WWDC &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=2357"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Apple said spatial audio would arrive on tvOS sometime “this fall,” offering a “full-surround experience” and “dynamic head tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IrFYs"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/tvos-and-macos-will-get-spatial-audio-support-for-airpods-pro-and-max"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that spatial audio on tvOS will only work with the Apple TV 4K, and it’s not clear what apps on the Apple TV will support the feature. Or when support for spatial audio through other headphones on either platform will be available. We’ve reached out to Apple to find out more and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
