    <title>Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HH3EVI"&gt;After Parler was banned on both the Apple and Google app stores for failing to curb violent and threatening content on its platform, the social media site is now completely offline as a result of Amazon terminating Parler’s web hosting services. The official Parler website now returns a 403 error, while its app is showing networking errors and can’t load content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler of its decision&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, in a letter to chief policy officer Amy Peikoff. Its Amazon Web Service (AWS) “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to Peikoff states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idJlPKDKDtg5Y6-ZthZ4Tw5JyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227121/File.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler’s iOS app, which now can’t load content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApEuFA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the Wednesday attack on the Capitol that left five people dead were circulated on other platforms in the wake of the riot. An example:  “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” to which another poster replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ruz0"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21986678%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;saw its user numbers spike&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler’s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW8lXP"&gt;When it pulled Parler from the Play Store, Google said while reasonable debate about content policy was possible, and it can be hard for apps to remove violative content immediately, “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.” Apple told the company that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XKD0V"&gt;Even with the app removed from the Play Store users could still install Parler on their Android devices by downloading it directly from Parler’s website and sideloading it. However, with its AWS services now disabled, the website and apps no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytelNk"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze — who, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22223335%2Fparler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; worked for AWS for three months in 2017 — wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds [sic] last hope for free speech and free information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; that the Parler could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze added, “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;Perhaps the best-known recent instance of a site being deplatformed for violent content was social network Gab. After a gunman killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/pittsburgh-funerals-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic threats on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google booted Gab app from its Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;Parler has not responded to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Locked Down, Supernova, Losing Alice and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9x2PLzyePPgRp-fp7_M55YKCMI=/249x0:1559x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68646979/lockd_donwn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway star in Locked Down | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mepeWor5JPk&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9nKl7i"&gt;So with all the chaos of the past week, you may have missed that Friday was the final episode of Jeopardy! with Alex Trebek as host. Trebek, who died in November at age 80 after a battle with cancer, hosted the answer-and-question game show for 37 years. The show posted a best-of highlight reel of Trebek’s performances over the years (remember the brouhaha when he shaved his mustache?!) and it may make you tear up a bit. My favorite appreciation of Trebek was from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/arts/television/alex-trebek-jeopardy.html"&gt;James Poniewozik in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which concludes: “He was our trusted man with the answers, even in times when reality came to us in the form of a question.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCCKAb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arsStQAhHVA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SMqPc8"&gt;Out new trailers this week range from dark and creepy to quirky to unsettling (which, to be totally honest, I prefer all of the above to syrupy holiday movies). Let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT4tGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="siXO2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zfSw7G1A-0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nPRlag"&gt;Losing Alice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="B6zDpi"&gt;A movie director fretting about her age meets a mysterious screenwriter on a train, and the two are drawn into a weird relationship. Love a good noir movie. Losing Alice was written and directed by Sigal Avin. Ayelet Zurer and Lihi Kornowski star in the eight-episode streaming series which premieres on Apple TV Plus January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8SO7io"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mepeWor5JPk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0UP4au"&gt;Locked Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2uUN"&gt;Look I just love Anne Hathaway so I’m willing to give anything she’s in at least a chance. A couple quarantining together during the pandemic just after they decide to break up, meh, OK. But &lt;em&gt;plot twist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;they also plan a jewelry heist at Harrod’s department store to steal a bazillion-dollar diamond. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I’m on board. Chiwetel Ejiofor (another fave) also stars in&lt;em&gt; Locked Down&lt;/em&gt;, which hits HBO Max January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EwnqT0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_62BeXxd_jo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jIFZHK"&gt;Derek DelGaudio’s In &amp;amp; Of Itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DttZwT"&gt;What is this weirdness about? Put simply, it’s a one-man show by Derek DelGuadio, who describes himself as a “storyteller and conceptual magician.” &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/in-of-itself-review-derek-delgaudio-frank-oz-sxsw-1202217981/"&gt;IndieWire’s review&lt;/a&gt; says it’s a blend of “stage trickery and alluring autobiographical asides,” that’s also a “meditation on existential yearning.” Hey I’m down for whatever. Directed by Frank Oz and produced by Steven Colbert (yep and yep!), &lt;em&gt;In &amp;amp; of Itself&lt;/em&gt; hits Hulu January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KgvaOq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRz2hY6ykGE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Cowg3v"&gt;Supernova&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbpC9g"&gt;Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth star as a partners of 20 years traveling across England to visit family and friends. It’s not just a beautiful road trip movie, though; Tucci’s character Tusker has dementia and is slowly losing his memory, so the pair are acutely aware of the value of the time they have left together. &lt;em&gt;Supernova&lt;/em&gt; is slated to hit theaters January 29th, with a “digital release” February 16th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes Parler from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1zEUh9OTr-kmE8w5ICh-zXLQLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68644631/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jYBDmZ"&gt;Apple has removed Parler from the App Store, following accusations that the social media app was fostering calls to violence ahead of, and following, the raid on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sczRDR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,” reads a statement from the company on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMGX2M"&gt;Apple issued an ultimatum to Parler on Friday demanding that it remove content in violation with its policies and provide a plan on how it would moderate content moving forward, which was &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said Parler had 24 hours to make the changes or else it would be removed from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFq69X"&gt;Apparently, Parler did propose some changes, but Apple decided they weren’t sufficient, according to a statement Apple sent to Parler alongside its final decision to remove the app. It states that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,” and that Parler will not return to the App Store until it has “demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbl08K"&gt;Here’s the full statement as provided by Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fbXilX"&gt;To the developers of the Parler app,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yubcZL"&gt;Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasLJX"&gt;Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9VKNj"&gt;In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfOJuv"&gt;Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwSxC1"&gt;For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ySL7W"&gt;Regards, App Review Board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vis3k"&gt;The app was briefly still available on Apple’s store after we received the statement, but it disappeared from the store a number of minutes after we published this post. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the app jumped up to #1 on the App Store and may have gained hundreds of thousands of users between the time Apple issued its 24-hour ultimatum and when the company pulled it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f16mNP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google pulled Parler&lt;/a&gt; Friday evening. “We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,” Google said in a statement. “We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74XGOB"&gt;Both Apple and Google faced pressure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt; to deplatform Parler, which is known for being conservative-friendly and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;having less stringent moderation&lt;/a&gt; than other social media platforms. The removal of both apps comes after a mob attack Wednesday on the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. On Friday, Amy Piekoff, head of policy at Parler, &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221435493001#sp=show-clips"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a ban from the App Store would be “huge,” adding that if it Apple removed Parler “we’re toast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAZBG"&gt;Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/7a9ba1df6d0949f2996dd7d5f13b1b49"&gt;posted a statement on Parler&lt;/a&gt; accusing Apple of applying a “horrible double standard” in its decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URthnz"&gt;“Apple, Google and the rest of the anti-competitive pack of big tech tyrants coordinate their moves and work together to stifle competition in the marketplace,” he wrote. Matze added more details would be coming soon about Parler’s plans “as we have many options.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjzs5v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 8:58PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Parler CEO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaBW2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbyNph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPWAQQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media and telco companies urged to preserve evidence from Capitol attack</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aoZXg"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is asking mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may be  connected to the attack on the US Capitol. Warner said in a statement Saturday that he contacted the CEOs of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4VTOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The United States Capitol is now a crime scene,” Warner &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22224462/capitol_attack_twitter.pdf"&gt;wrote in his letters&lt;/a&gt;. “The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are currently investigating the events of that day, and trying to piece together what happened and the perpetrators involved. The prospect of litigation on behalf of the victims of the mayhem also is highly likely. Messaging data to and from your subscribers that may have participated in, or assisted, those engaged in this insurrection – and associated subscriber information – are critical evidence in helping to bring these rioters to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yemBp"&gt;Warner noted that many of those participating in the January 6th attack that left five people dead posted images to social media, or shared them via text and mobile messaging platforms while the riot was underway and afterward, “to celebrate their disdain for our democratic process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTUI64"&gt;All the named companies routinely comply with &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/digitaldiscovery/library/preservation/preservationanalysis.html"&gt;court-issued preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;, issued during criminal investigations. But Warner’s letter is an informal request, without the legal force of a criminal preservation order, and it is unclear how the companies will respond. Court-issued preservation orders are often issued under seal so it is also possible that one of the many agencies investigating the Capitol raid has already issued such an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVn9sb"&gt;We’ve reached out to the companies to ask how and if they plan to comply with Warner’s request and will update if we hear back from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhFLv8"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “continuing our ongoing, proactive outreach to law enforcement and have worked to quickly provide responses to valid legal requests. We are removing content, disabling accounts, and working with law enforcement to protect against direct threats to public safety.” T-Mobile acknowledged it had received Warner’s letter. “As always, we will fully cooperate with requests from law enforcement,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HhUjv"&gt;To reiterate, however, Warner’s request doesn’t carry quite the same legal weight as a subpoena or other formal request from a law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8fHkL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/capitol-riot-democrats-social-media-456325"&gt;Warner told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that following Wednesday’s attack, Congress would “come back with a vengeance” against social media platforms that were unable to rein in violent content and threats on their platforms. “This is going to come back and bite ‘em,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJb7nH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 1:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mY9cWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 3:43PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from T-Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store made an estimated $64 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1KGftnuRi0M1JL9oBjZ7X5Pizck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639783/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KcvAtL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;According to CNBC’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s App Store made $64 billion in revenue in 2020, which is a 28 percent increase from the estimated $50 billion it made in 2019. This represents a good amount of growth for the App Store since the estimated increase between 2018 and 2019 was only 3.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gnEwX"&gt;It’s hard to tell the exact reason for the spike in growth, but it likely had something to do with the COVID-19 pandemic. I can say from personal experience that I bought quite a few more games in 2020 than I have in years past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup/22206745/2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place"&gt;as well as subscriptions to fitness&lt;/a&gt; and productivity apps to try to regain some control of my life during quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwJfxj"&gt;When Apple reports on its financials, it lumps the money it makes from the App Store in with its services revenue, &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/apple-to-release-financial-results-amid-global-crisis/"&gt;which is by far its fastest-growing category&lt;/a&gt;. The company takes a 30 percent cut of most of the money coming in to the App Store, which, while there are caveats and exceptions, represents billions of dollars of revenue. Apple typically guards its take carefully, despite recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;pushback from developers like Hey.com&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;legal challenges from Epic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVKrKD"&gt;Its grip has recently loosened just a little, though, as Apple now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;only takes a 15 percent cut from developers who make under $1 million a year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store. That isn’t likely to have a huge change on the revenue estimates, as analysts have approximated that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;the top 2 percent of App Store developers generate 95 percent of the revenue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu63PU"&gt;Every year, Apple reports how much money it has paid out to developers since 2008. CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;used that to calculate the App Store revenue number by subtracting last year’s number from this year’s, then it accounts for Apple’s 30 percent cut. While the numbers may be a little rough, Apple doesn’t self-report them, so all we can do is get close. Regardless, there are two things that are hard to argue: the App Store’s revenue grew by quite a bit this year, and it brought in a lot of money for both developers and for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok debuts first augmented reality filter that uses iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DygVw3ARrSiEzfSckTBv7MAI6U8=/0x61:1140x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631739/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_4.48.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhmZUR"&gt;TikTok has released its first augmented reality filter that can utilize the iPhone 12 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for an enhanced confetti effect that realistically settles on people or objects in your room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2G3MoC"&gt;The effect itself is just a somewhat belated 2021 ball drop (which feels like it would have been a lot more useful a few days ago.) But the ball drop filter is just the start, with TikTok promising to “develop more innovative effects in 2021.” And the fact that one of the most popular video platforms in the world is jumping onboard with support for one of the marquee features on Apple’s more pricey and premium smartphones is certainly notable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2M5naX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To ring in 2021 we released our first AR effect on the new iPhone 12 Pro, using LiDAR technology which allows us to create effects that interact with your environment - visually bridging the digital and physical worlds. We're excited to develop more innovative effects in 2021! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6yFD2FfHta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6yFD2FfHta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokComms (@tiktok_comms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_comms/status/1346828242506969089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAnqPi"&gt;TikTok isn’t the only major company with eyes on Apple’s LIDAR tech. Snapchat, one of the other major players when it comes to augmented reality filters, already added support for Apple’s LIDAR sensor &lt;a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/news/create-lidar-powered-lenses-for-the-new-iphone-12-pro/"&gt;back in October&lt;/a&gt;, allowing creators to build their own enhanced AR filters for the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple celebrates the Year of the Ox with limited AirPods Pro in Asia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZAYDEQaWLHOnr3Xhm3MR9sUB6Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68631509/app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="reHh0q"&gt;February 12th marks the first day of Lunar New Year, with 2021 ushering in the Year of the Ox and saying farewell to the Year of the Rat. To celebrate, Apple is releasing limited edition AirPods Pro in certain Asian countries, with a case branded with a new version of the cow emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXbijB"&gt;Apple has also given an ox-themed makeover to its logo on some regional versions of its website:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOcnU-kbNPaBIotVqc7JfIuWLA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219378/Screen_Shot_2021_01_07_at_17.17.28.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V4eMsW"&gt;The special edition AirPods Pro sell for the same price as the regular AirPods Pro, which is just as well considering you can order those with any text or emoji you want engraved on the case for free. They’re 1,999 yuan ($310) &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/product/MJ533CH/A"&gt;in mainland China&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and they’re also for sale in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLV6w4"&gt;Apple is limiting orders to two per customer, and the AirPods Pro will only be available at retail Apple Stores as well as Apple’s local websites in each region. The Year of the Ox only comes around once every 12 years, though, so if you do buy these you may end up wanting to swap them out for a tiger-themed model in a year’s time — assuming Apple decides to release one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned your Apple Watch can double as a vlogging viewfinder </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJ2R2SUUeFS4mE0jZx5JI8_l2w0=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68625472/20210105_mitchell_clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UgD7vJ"&gt;The Apple Watch’s ability to act as a camera remote for your phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced"&gt;got a mention in its announcement keynote&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s been around a while, but I’ve only ever used it once or twice to take group pictures. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta/status/1346526439068160002?s=20"&gt;Twitter user @PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt;, however, has pointed out that you can also use it as a vlogging aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6TueN"&gt;Doing this is simple: On your watch, go to the Camera Remote app. This will open the camera app on your iPhone, and you can switch it to video mode, set it up, and record. You don’t even have to strap your watch to your phone like he does in the tweet; the remote camera will totally work while your watch is on your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B1HhEr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the best self-recording hack ever and even works with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FiLMiCPro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FiLMiCPro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSciretta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PeterSciretta&lt;/a&gt; for this tip.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/LGKS3S2pCh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LGKS3S2pCh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Roy   ☕️     (@pulpjedi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pulpjedi/status/1346523889736695808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C3hAgW"&gt;I’ve shot videos on my phone before, and it was often an exercise in frustration trying to get the framing right. There was a lot of running back and forth, recording short clips to make sure the focus and framing were correct. I could’ve definitely saved myself the hassle if I had remembered that my watch could do this, though I guess I would’ve gotten fewer steps in. It’s a sacrifice I’ll just have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1VTzHl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Using your Apple Watch as an iPhone viewfinder: surprisingly latency-free and useful &lt;a href="https://t.co/PyoxK6TxND"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PyoxK6TxND&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1346618135604908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3jPJX"&gt;Android users don’t need to feel left out either, as Wear OS devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18014640/google-pixel-wear-os-smartwatch-camera-viewfinder"&gt;can also act as a camera viewfinder&lt;/a&gt; when connected to Pixel phones. The Apple Watch trick will also work with the popular video camera app FiLMiC Pro, as Jeff mentions in his tweet. That way, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7925023/sundance-film-festival-2015-tangerine-iphone-5s"&gt;all the benefits the third-party app offers&lt;/a&gt;, plus the remote viewing on your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sAwSS"&gt;Of course, if you’re setting out to create a new vlogging setup, this is probably not the best way to go, especially if you don’t already have an Apple Watch. For less than the price of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/3/11/18259791/apple-watch-series-3-lte-best-buy-price-sale"&gt;Apple’s least expensive Watch (the Series 3)&lt;/a&gt;, you could instead get Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F1%2F5%2F22216064%2Fiphone-vlogging-video-apple-watch-viewfinder#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lightning to HDMI adapter&lt;/a&gt; (which would also let you power your phone so it doesn’t run out of battery), and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-1280x800-Mirrorless-Panasonic-Included/dp/B077FTPT46/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=camera+monitor&amp;amp;qid=1609895598&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;tag=duckduckgo-osx-b-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small camera monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Or, you could just position your phone in front of a mirror. But if you already have an Apple Watch, and want to film yourself using your iPhone, this tip may just make that easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why Anker’s MagSafe-style charger has a gigantic USB-C plug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0-jrA5RiTLAxqlZDt3nWpPF0Bk=/0x0:1850x1233/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68624545/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_3.29.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rgoFru"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging system&lt;/a&gt; offers a whole new way to charge iPhones, and third-party companies like Anker are jumping at the chance to make their own magnetic chargers — both official ones that work with Apple’s system and unofficial ones that just take advantage of the magnetic setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw8u4s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-Anker-PowerWave/dp/B08LPPD3NL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s $22 charger&lt;/a&gt; falls into the second category: it’s not an official MagSafe charger, meaning it doesn’t offer the faster 15W charging speed or the fancy NFC tricks as “official” MagSafe products. But even with that 7.5W charging limit, Anker’s charger does &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; a lot like Apple’s, at least at first glance. Look closer at the other end of the plug, though, and there’s an obvious difference: the Anker model has a weirdly oversized USB-C plug. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoVsUSjuo3UYaRxwdk8v9zGejxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216019/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.48.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oNTW43"&gt;That’s because the Anker charger is effectively just a regular Qi charger in a different shape, one that moves the wiring and chips to the plug in order to slim down on the actual charging pad. The design also helps reduce heat, according to the company. It may look strange, but if you think of it less as a charging cable and more as a miniaturized Qi charger, it’s actually quite impressive to see what Anker has pulled off here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5irF4i"&gt;The new charger is also just the first effort from Anker. The company says that stock will be limited, but it’s already working on upgraded magnetic charger models that should be out in about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALND1T"&gt;On the one hand, the Anker charger is a clear indication of the limits of Apple’s MagSafe program. Third-party companies that aren’t able to create official products have to find creative workarounds, like Anker’s gigantic plug. On the other hand, Anker’s charger is a first-generation product, so these alternatives will likely get better over time. And at $22 — roughly half of what Apple charges for an official MagSafe charger, the slower charging speed might be a worthwhile trade-off for the lower price, especially as the designs continue to get more and more refined. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8wxBfg"&gt;Apple has been granted two patents that describe adding two-way wireless charging to its devices (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/macbook-wirelessly-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The patents, first &lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/01/apple-has-been-granted-a-pair-of-2-way-charging-patents-for-a-future-macbook-pro-that-could-recharge-idevices-and-more.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Patently Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include drawings that show a MacBook charging various devices, including an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as drawings of iPads and iPhones doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzIN8M"&gt;If this sounds familiar, it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21353196/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-price-release-date-camera-stylus-specs"&gt;many other phone makers&lt;/a&gt; have released devices with similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;reverse wireless charging technology&lt;/a&gt;. Although Apple’s take is a little different. According to the patent images, a MacBook’s lid, palm rest, or trackpad could be used to charge a wireless charging-compatible iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3fZqL9Bx3Qcb2pcKVmaX8Zpjw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215615/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.24.55_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patent shows a future MacBook device charging an iPhone and Apple Watch, though this configuration would make it tricky to use the computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiKgL"&gt;The problem the patents claim to solve is the one where you may find yourself without enough outlets, power bricks, or any electricity at all. The patents state that “despite having standardized connectors and cable[s], each device may require a separate or dedicated power supply to charge. In some cases, having separate power supplies for each device may be burdensome to use, store, and/or transport.” (Of course, having separate power bricks for your devices is also made more difficult &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455726/apple-removes-charging-brick-watch-edition-hermes-model-environment"&gt;when they aren’t included in the box&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3oI461NOFoIxv3TBWA_gwrOc9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215618/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_10.25.15_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This figure showing devices being charged on a MacBook’s lid suggests that you could use your laptop as a wireless charging pad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fkWgSd"&gt;There are other times when this kind of tech could be useful. For example, if you’re away from a charger and your Apple Watch or AirPods die, it’d be useful to be able to top them up with your phone. Likewise, being able to charge your phone from your laptop would be useful, and if Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;truly heading toward a portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, this type of tech could be a way to retain that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrY6TH"&gt;Right now, MacBooks and iPads are made out of aluminum, which isn’t compatible with wireless charging. If Apple wants to include this reverse wireless charging tech in its devices, it’ll have to design around that limitation. (Maybe it could bring back a plastic MacBook?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqvby"&gt;It’s also hard to avoid thinking about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple’s ill-fated AirPower project&lt;/a&gt; when considering the idea of a MacBook or iPad filled with wireless charging coils that are able to charge multiple devices at once. To be fair, Apple’s tech has progressed since then, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;now has control of the processors in all of its devices&lt;/a&gt;. It may come up with some solution to help the devices communicate and power levels and thermal constraints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ1rVy"&gt;Whether you’ll actually be able to use your MacBook as a wireless charging pad for all of your devices remains to be seen, but I’d at least like to see this tech come to the iPhone. Many of its competitors already have some sort of reverse wireless charging capability, and while it’d be great to see it cranked up to 11 like in the below patent drawing, I’d be happy with Apple just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/3/21548318/google-pixel-5-wireless-charging-pad-qi-automatic-battery-share"&gt;catching up with the competition at this point&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537855/iphone-12-mini-pro-max-reverse-wireless-charging-fcc-filings-hidden"&gt;it seems like the iPhone 12 has the hardware to do this&lt;/a&gt;, it’s currently not enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
