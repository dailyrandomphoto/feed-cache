    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woOIOK"&gt;Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new computer, phone, game console, or backpack and finding out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy — and prevent them from going elsewhere — many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price that you’ve found elsewhere. They will also sometimes match themselves if you buy something that goes down in price a week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ax9brN"&gt;What follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules here, but you’d be advised to go to the links that we’ve provided and read the policy carefully. Second, and logically enough, retailers that are marketplaces for other sellers, such as Amazon or Costco, don’t have price-matching policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XPiVHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SnrYOy"&gt;Finally, most retailers that do have price-matching policies suspend them for special occasions, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So if your favorite store isn’t offering a Black Friday deal on that phone you want, you can’t wave an ad showing a 50 percent off deal from another retailer and expect it to be honored. But at other times of the year, these price matches can save you a nice amount of cash. So keep them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL1GkN"&gt;Another thing to keep in mind: there are exceptions to most rules. So if you’re looking for a deal on a product and you know of a lower price elsewhere (or one that was offered previously at the same retailer), it never hurts to call and ask if they’ll match the price. Meanwhile, we will continue to update this page if and when we get more information about retailers’ policies.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Amazon Box Padded" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVVDqo-ZRtvgpbifq_CxcaoG5v8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/808921/amazon-box_padded.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zlWjKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201895700"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Da17oI"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t offer price matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0xnH6m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail_us.html"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5zjbYJ"&gt;While we’ve &lt;a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/money/save-apple-products"&gt;seen some claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will price-match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPGuh"&gt;Apple does say that if it reduces its price on an Apple-branded product within 14 days from when you received your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or get credit for the price difference.  However, that doesn’t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Qi8pdG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/6744eb1c-2f60-4f58-b788-fe62bdda77c5"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UbTuol"&gt;B&amp;amp;H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its Customer Service team using the on-site &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2Fshcalendar.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FcontactForm.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, or by calling (800) 221-5743 / (212) 239-7765.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dNk2pN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcustomer-service%2Fprice-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat290300050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat290300050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lR0K8U"&gt;Best Buy’s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it’s new, identical to the competitor’s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor’s store or on its site, and not shown on &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s exclusion list&lt;/a&gt; (which includes “items for sale the Friday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLKa50"&gt;However, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-holiday-faqs%2Fpcmcat748300621076.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300621076&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will refund&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members the difference on any “Black Friday Price Guarantee” item whose prices go lower on or before November 26th. Members will receive their refunds by December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="online-tab"&gt;You have to either communicate with Best Buy via its on-site chat, making sure you’re able to show the ad or website with a lower price, to get the difference. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA0C0T"&gt;Best Buy will also, upon request, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;match its previous in-store or online price&lt;/a&gt; as long as it’s done during the return and exchange period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3qB94X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1162/~/does-costco-price-match-with-other-retailers%3F"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4PeVC3"&gt;Costco does not price-match with competitors. However, according to the website, it will &lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/628/related/1"&gt;issue a credit for the difference between the price you paid and a promotional price&lt;/a&gt; if you bought the item online at Costco.com and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Dell chromebook 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZNuCLfFtMuTjo-Urr0_WTwb8bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4181080/dell2_2040.0.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p id="jIkK4a"&gt;Before you make a purchase, Dell will price-match a new computer that shares the same key features and specs as the one you bought (such as memory, hard drive capacity, processor, etc.) from Dell, HP, Apple, or Lenovo. You can call 1-844-906-4250 or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/lp/chat-live-with-product-expert" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat online&lt;/a&gt; and show a Dell sales expert a link to the competitor’s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4kwKE"&gt;You can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving or on Green Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;h3 id="QRyQwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fright-to-cancellation&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3KrRyo"&gt;We could not find any evidence of a price-matching policy at DJI. However, if DJI reduces the price on a product within seven days from when you received it, you can contact the company within that time at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fcontact&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dji.com/contact&lt;/a&gt; to request a refund or credits for the difference between the price you have been charged and the current selling price. This doesn’t include special sales events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1z7myz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fbest-price-guarantee%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSqKIj"&gt;If you find a lower price from a qualifying competitor on an eBay Deal item that you bought within 48 hours — or on another product with the “Best Price Guarantee” symbol attached to it — you’ll get “110 percent” of the difference. That means eBay will give you an eBay coupon for the difference in price between what you bought the item for and what the competitor is selling it for, plus an additional 10 percent of that price difference. Note, however, these coupons will expire within 30 days of being issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmKMzB"&gt;The products must be new and unopened and identical to the competitor’s item. You have to contact &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fbuying%2Fpaying-items%2Febay-deals-price-match-guarantee%3Fid%3D4627%26st%3D2%26pos%3D3%26query%3DeBay%2520Deals%2520Price%2520Match%2520Guarantee%26intent%3Dbest%2520pri%23contactWay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay Customer Service&lt;/a&gt;, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kKze31"&gt;&lt;a href="https://care.gamestop.com/"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YUBNOV"&gt;Wario64, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1387484248412540928"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021 the store &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/gamestop-price-matching-first-improvement-new-leadership/#:~:text=According%20to%20Wario64%2C%20GameStop%20has,like%20flash%20deals%20and%20bundles."&gt;has issued&lt;/a&gt; a price-matching policy. At this time, however, we could not find any evidence of one at GameStop. We will contact their representatives and update this post when we get a definitive answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QSyTYW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleshopping/answer/9248265?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9112467"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXpzci"&gt;According to the Google site, the company doesn’t price match at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="luaqEM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpcv%2Fpricematch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5bEOgs"&gt;According to HP.com, the company will match the current pre-tax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, or Best Buy. The specs have to be the same; however, the product model number does not need to be identical for computers. You have to ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1-800-888-0229. You can’t request a price match via email or chat, either, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RzcqT"&gt;If you find a comparable product at a lower price during the return period, you can email HP at &lt;a href="mailto:myhpsales@hp.com"&gt;myhpsales@hp.com&lt;/a&gt;. This only applies to branded HP products and doesn’t apply to products purchased during certain sales events, like the week of Thanksgiving through the week following Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zlGHar"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fshopping-faq%2F%3ForgRef%3Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252F%23payments&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZgY6s"&gt;Lenovo will match the price of comparable Lenovo, HP, or Dell PCs with the same key specs a nationally recognized online retailer sells at the time of purchase. You can call 1-855-253-6686 and select option 2&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to get the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puO6jm"&gt;Lenovo will also refund you the difference if the price of a product you buy from the company lowers during the holiday season. Through January 17th, 2021, customers can request an adjustment on orders made on its site between October 18th, 2021 and December 17th, 2021 (for up to five of the same products). You can still request a price adjustment outside of that time frame within 30 calendar days from the date of invoice. Note this does not apply to special discount offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zU8pt"&gt;To get the holiday season price difference credit, you’ll need to fill out a form on the site and take a screenshot of the lower price on Lenovo.com with a date/time stamp included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S3XMgj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fwhy-microsoft-store%3Ficid%3Dfooter_why-msft-store_7102020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Umm33M"&gt;Microsoft will refund you the difference if it lowers the price of a product within 30 days of purchase. For Surface devices, you have up to 60 days but with some exclusions — the price match doesn’t extend to the Surface Hub, for example. You can call 1-877-696-7786 to get a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6E4o7E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnepro%2F16-2624%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndafcr"&gt;Newegg offers price-matching on select items; these products are identified by the label “Price Match Guarantee” that appears in the price box on the right of the product page. This applies whether you find that lower price on Newegg or at what Newegg judges to be a major retailer. You need to notify Newegg of the lower price within 14 days of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi0pN6"&gt;The price-match guarantee is not valid during major holiday sales events, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Green Monday. However, Newegg does offer what it calls &lt;a href="https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/black-friday-price-protection/"&gt;“Black Friday Price Protection”&lt;/a&gt; — if you purchase any product that has that badge, is purchased between October 14th, 2021 and November 21st, 2021, and is discounted on or before November 30th, 2021, you can be refunded the difference. According to Newegg, you don’t have to do anything; the refund will be processed by December 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="oTri2i"&gt;If you buy a product online, you can request a price match within eight days of purchase for Sam’s Club items with promotional prices. Neither deal applies to events such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PTIGUW"&gt;We didn’t find anything on the Sonos site about price-matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUKzHp"&gt;&lt;a href="http://help.target.com/help/SubCategoryArticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Availability+%26+Pricing"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0LHIy"&gt;Target will match the price of an item that you find for less either at Target or at a &lt;a href="https://target.scene7.com/is/content/Target/GUEST_625b83e8-f353-41bf-8a1c-abc6876f482f"&gt;select list of competitors&lt;/a&gt; if you ask for it at the time of or within 14 days of your purchase. You can either bring your proof into the store or call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58EZZ"&gt;If you buy a product in-store or online starting October 10th, 2021, Target will also adjust the price if it lowers it on or before December 24th, 2021. Additionally, Target will price match designated discounted items that are a part of its “Holiday Best” sale if their price goes down through December 24th, 2021. Clearance sales and other storewide or category promotions are excluded. There is a complete list of exceptions on the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dJElQg"&gt;Walmart’s online store offers price matching on one in-stock item per customer per day from a specified list of retailers. There is a long list of restrictions on the site; for example, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#price-match-policy"&gt;does not apply to in-store purchases&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not apply to prices shown during pre-Black Friday events, as well as Black Friday and Cyber Week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="samsung experience store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f97dE635Tu-ZVkNyI4aPVE0cHiM=/105x0:795x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67804922/experience_stores_middle_row1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDTB22"&gt;With the holiday season right around the corner, everyone is double-checking their lists and figuring out the best places to fulfill those orders. Thankfully, there are often a number of options when it comes to retailers that have what you want. Because of this, online retailers aren’t just dropping prices to compete with each other, but offering more generous shipping and return policies for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjdpKv"&gt;Most people will still be doing the majority of their shopping online this year, which means that most retailers will be offering free shipping for anyone who spends a set dollar amount. However, this sudden surge in online shopping does increase the possibility for delays as online retailers become flooded with orders and their logistics struggle to keep pace. While this may not be the case across the board, we’d recommend getting your orders in early wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wxXOrP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eJP472"&gt;Below, we’ve collected the current shipping and return policies for a number of major online retailers. Very few of them have policies that pertain specifically to holiday shipping, but we’ll be keeping tabs on them and updating our alphabetical list accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INRR1b"&gt;Hopefully, knowing more about how much you’ll spend and how much leeway you have to make a return will help lessen your holiday angst somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol18Sw"&gt;Note: like last year, the vast majority of online retailers quote no-contact delivery for their products due to the ongoing pandemic. So, unless your package is listed as “signature required,” we recommend that you track your packages closely to make sure you know precisely when they’re due to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NPvilQ"&gt;Amazon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F712kX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=468520&amp;amp;ref_=footer_shiprates"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Prime members get free same-day delivery on qualifying orders over $35 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=psdd_help?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=8729023011"&gt;qualifying ZIP codes&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t in one of those ZIP codes, the usual next-day or two-day deliveries apply, depending on the product. Non-Prime buyers will find shipping options on the order page of each specific product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6LfVz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201819200"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;During the holidays, items shipped by Amazon between October 1st, 2021 and December 31st, 2021 can be returned until January 31st, 2022. (This applies to both Prime and non-Prime buyers.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Store Beijing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIg_P1Csxl2HNhue8mdiCOvLEaE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10968695/apple-store-beijing.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Store Beijing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dAAANq"&gt;Apple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaJcT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/shipping_delivery"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you buy directly from Apple, shipping is free on all orders; however, how fast you will get your item can vary. Two-day shipping is free on most items, and in-stock Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, or Apple TVs usually get free next-day shipping. This policy can fluctuate based on the item you’re purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7DaqO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Apple’s holiday return policy allows for products that are received between November 1st and December 25th to be returned through January 8th. Any purchase made after December 25th is subject to the standard return policy, and all the usual terms and conditions apply. Please note that this only applies to items that were purchased directly from Apple or an Apple retail store. Otherwise, you need to follow the specific retailer's policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fb3BNk"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="32yxRo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FHelpCenter%2FShipping.jsp%23freeShipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;B&amp;amp;H offers free standard shipping (that’s one to seven business days) for most items and free expedited shipping (one to three business days) for items over $49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CI68a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FHelpCenter%2FReturnExchange.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;B&amp;amp;H allows purchases bought after October 18th, 2021 and before January 2nd, 2022 to be returned or exchanged through February 1st, 2022 (with the usual exceptions of non-returnable items such as computers or TVs whose packaging has been opened).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Buy UK store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhZlsHCXkJOCydmX5NcE4-UKnec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/779529/best-buy-uk-store.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e1fEeV"&gt;Best Buy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="csNbZG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Best Buy is offering free next-day shipping on orders costing $35 and up (with some exceptions). However, this delivery policy is based on product availability, what you purchased, and when you purchased it. Best Buy clearly states that there are limitations on its next-day deliveries during Thanksgiving week, for instance, and that larger appliances, like TVs, require a scheduled delivery with &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftv-home-theater%2Ffree-tv-shipping-or-delivery%2Fpcmcat748300551037.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300551037&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;different terms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVurd4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Freturn-exchange-policy%2Fpcmcat260800050014.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat260800050014&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Purchases made from October 18th, 2021 through January 2nd, 2022 can be returned through January 16th, 2022. This doesn’t include items that come with a third-party contract, such as phones, cellular tablets, and wearables (which have a 14-day return period), or holiday products, such as tree decorations, and major appliances, which have a 15-day return window. My Best Buy Elite members have until January 16th or 30 days from receipt, whichever is longer; Elite Plus members have until January 16th or 45 days from receipt, whichever is longer. Finally, Best Buy Totaltech members have until January 16th or 60 days from receipt, whichever is longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MKR2oa"&gt;Costco &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Hhhz3G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1152"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Costco doesn’t offer free shipping and quotes its shipping fees during checkout; fees depend on the product and the shipping method. However, the wholesale retailer does offer a variety of delivery options, including “white glove” service for larger appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnmKbu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1191/related/1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Costco generally has an open return policy, except for electronics such as TVs and computers, which have a 90-day return window. There are other exceptions, which are listed on its return page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cKKhNu"&gt;Dell &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="feUDOY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/lp/dell-free-shipping" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Most of Dell’s products come with free standard shipping (no minimum purchase necessary). The delivery window can vary based on your order, but Dell does offer expedited shipping options as well as a delivery date estimate based on your ZIP code upon checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EttSC8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/legal_terms-conditions_dellgrmwebpage/art-us-return-policy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Dell offers a 30-day return policy with some exceptions; a restocking fee of up to 15 percent may be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9bNgua"&gt;DJI &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UDthVA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fpages%2Fhelp-center-shipping%3Ffrom%3Dstore_footer%26text%3Dsd&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;DJI offers free shipping on purchases of $149 or more. Otherwise, shipping fees are specified on the order form. Shipment times can vary for each product depending on availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYC3SO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fpages%2Fhelp-center-aftersales%3Ffrom%3Dstore_footer&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;DJI offers returns within 14 days of receiving the purchase, provided it remains in like-new condition or suffers from some type of manufacturing defect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2hgoV1"&gt;GameStop &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X0m0JW"&gt;Google &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IktmuF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/6380752?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3245086"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;All orders made between October 19th, 2021 and January 31st, 2022 qualify for free shipping with no minimum. Just note that this applies to the lowest-cost shipping available, which may not be the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znFCS3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/2411741?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3244667"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; All purchases made via the Google Store between November 26th, 2021 and December 10th, 2021 can be returned through January 10th, 2022. Any purchases made from December 11th through January 31st, 2022 can be returned up to 30 days after it was received. Google has also waived its restocking fee for anything returned between October 19th, 2021 and January 31st, 2022. (The standard return policy lets you send a product back up to 15 days after receipt of the item, except for Nest thermostats, which have 30 days.) &lt;/p&gt;

There are exceptions, and some items may be subject to a restocking fee of up to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tempo’s simplified smart home gym uses an iPhone to track your workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRYNWWXjUGvUSoa23FHjYe2vMOk=/0x1:5487x3659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078626/Tempo_Move_Lifestyle_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dock an iPhone into the Tempo Move and it’ll output workouts to a connected TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tempo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oRjf2i"&gt;Tempo, the smart home gym that uses computer vision to track your workouts and offer guidance in real time, has gone on a diet. Today it’s launching the Tempo Move, a new home workout setup that ditches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;the original’s&lt;/a&gt; 42-inch touchscreen with Microsoft’s Azure Kinect sensors built in, in favor of using existing TVs combined with the sensors built into the iPhone XS / XR and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZQMrI"&gt;It means that the Tempo Move’s setup is slimmed down compared to the original Tempo Studio, but there’s still a lot of hardware here. At the center is what Tempo’s calling the “Core,” which is effectively an iPhone dock that can connect to a TV via HDMI. The kit also comes with a storage unit containing “smart weights” including plates and dumbbells. With a suggested retail price of $495 plus a monthly subscription cost of $39, the Tempo Move is far from budget, but it’s a lot more affordable than the $2,495 Tempo charges for the &lt;a href="https://imp.i277339.net/c/482924/814975/11505?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftempo.fit%2Fshop%3Fpackage%3Dstarter&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tempo Studio Starter Package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpojpvPs4lGXPPgXWnndmk1hjvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22978861/Tempo_Move_Product_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tempo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smart weights come with a cabinet in which to store them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DPORiX"&gt;“We’re at an inflection point now that iPhone models are able to run sophisticated AI locally and have precise depth-sensing technology,” says Tempo co-founder and CTO Josh Augustin. “Experiences that used to require expensive hardware can now be built on devices many of us already own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1Tg0g"&gt;The Tempo Move is designed to offer a similar range of exercises to the original Studio. You get “thousands” of live and on-demand workout classes covering everything from strength training to HIIT, yoga, and cardio. The system uses computer vision to track the smart weights and offer advice on form, track progress, and give workout recommendations. Tempo says that dumbbells are supported at launch, and support for barbells and kettlebell classes is coming next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7BEc4"&gt;Since the system relies on Apple’s TrueDepth camera tech in the iPhone XS / XR and newer (not including the iPhone SE), there’s no sign of Android support just yet. The company says it’s also working on adding support for the lidar sensors built into the iPhone 12 Pro and up in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m9OgJ"&gt;The Tempo Move is available starting today at an introductory price of $395. Tempo says the Move will ship in early December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats discontinues several products including Powerbeats, Solo Pro, and Beats EP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the Beats Solo Pro headphones, the best on-ear noise-canceling headphones, worn on a woman’s head." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jVsz3mMneUJzVdHI2qbOw_hTvuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076809/cwelch_191024_3759_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro on-ear headphones are being discontinued despite being newer than models that will remain available.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLa8X1"&gt;On the same day that it announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;the new $200 Fit Pro earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are receiving universal praise in early reviews, Apple’s Beats brand is thinning out the rest of its product lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fivAfY"&gt;As noticed by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-discontinues-beats-headphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has quietly discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;, noise-canceling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931329/beats-solo-pro-review-noise-canceling-on-ear-wireless-headphones-features-price"&gt;Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt; headphones, and entry-level Beats EP headphones. All three products are no longer available directly from Apple, and while stock may remain at third-party retailers, they’ll be gone once current inventory is sold through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMUy9U"&gt;A Beats spokesperson confirmed the news, but declined to go into detail on why these specific products have gotten the axe. It’s reasonable to speculate that their sales came in well below the company’s more established hits. Clearly the Powerbeats, introduced fairly recently in March 2020, couldn’t match the demand of the true wireless Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qo71RhuJ3vhEbGQPiXsqxOl6ix4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19808862/DSCF5798.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats neckbuds are also discontinued as of today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LUqNiU"&gt;And in the case of headphones, over-ear mainstays like the Solo 3 and Studio 3 are still sticking around, while the on-ear Solo Pros — released &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; both of those pairs — are the first to be discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9S0Xkd"&gt;With these changes, &lt;a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/products"&gt;according to Beats’ website&lt;/a&gt;, its product family now consists of the just-launched Fit Pro earbuds, Powerbeats Pro, Solo3, Studio3, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex neckbuds&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the line. Aside from earbuds and headphones, the company also continues to sell its Pill Plus Bluetooth speaker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is bringing car crash detection to the iPhone, says the Wall Street Journal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150 with an iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvjPnk_oVRLSndddN19JbOyAtOo=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70076352/DSC_9414.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Have you experienced an accident?” | Nilay Patel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlAKCX"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a new iPhone and Apple Watch feature that detects if you’re in a car crash and dials 911 automatically. The current plan is to roll out such a feature next year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-detect-car-crashes-auto-dial-911-11635768001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBhkve"&gt;Google’s Personal Safety app on Pixel phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892875/google-pixel-personal-safety-app-car-crash-detection"&gt;already includes&lt;/a&gt; a feature to call for help when it detects car crashes, just like connected car services in modern vehicles do, including GM’s OnStar, Subaru’s Starlink, and Fiat Chrysler’s Uconnect. Many cars on the road today are not equipped with any connectivity features, so getting crash detection on an iPhone too means more drivers can get the help they need in an accident as long as they have one in their pocket or mounted to their dash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5w2iN"&gt;The rise of unsafe smartphone usage in cars made way for integration systems like CarPlay and Android Auto, the former appearing in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/29/apple-carplay-massive-success-paves-way-for-automotive-entry.html"&gt;nearly 80 percent of new vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, according to Apple. Building a new crash detection feature into the iPhone alongside CarPlay could bolster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714265/apple-carplay-ironheart-vision-car-settings-climate-seat-radio"&gt;Apple’s rumored “IronHeart” project&lt;/a&gt; to connect its phone with car settings in the same way HomeKit controls smart speakers and lighting. Targeting the annual &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1006-investor.html"&gt;$2 billion revenue stream&lt;/a&gt; that GM brings in with OnStar with the built-in features would be a very Apple thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz1Kc2"&gt;While Apple’s accident detection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/18/17129440/emergency-sos-iphone-apple-watch-accident"&gt;hasn’t always worked as intended&lt;/a&gt; in the past, the company has had many years to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/device-analytics/"&gt;collect data and analytics&lt;/a&gt; on willing iOS and watchOS users. It remains to be seen how accurately Apple will be able to detect car crashes, let alone people falling. Speaking from personal experience, I took a tumble from a scooter in February 2020 wearing an Apple Watch Series 4, and the device was ready to call emergency services until I tapped the “I’m OK” button. But after a more recent trip-and-fall incident, my Apple Watch Series 7 did not offer assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy an orange Apple HomePod Mini now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoAQwXDhfahOw3348hXpCyTavFo=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074127/apple_minis.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini is now available in three new colors — orange, yellow, and blue — in addition to white and space gray. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/homepod-mini-is-available-in-bold-new-colors-starting-today/"&gt;buy Apple’s HomePod Mini in new colors&lt;/a&gt; yellow, orange, and blue (in addition to the standard white and space gray), and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;the $99.99 devices&lt;/a&gt; are available for in-store pickup today. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced the new colors at its October Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt;, where it unveiled its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEne8p"&gt;It’s also where Apple announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, a cheaper tier of its music streaming service that you access only via the Siri voice assistant, although there will be a limited app option; it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month and will work with the Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAis36"&gt;The new speakers will have the HomePod mini’s tinted touch surface, fabric mesh, volume icons, and power cable, along with color-matched details. Apple’s competitors already have more colorful options for their small home assistant speakers — Google has blue and orange versions of its Nest Mini speaker, and Amazon’s Echo Dot comes in blue and some animal-themed designs for kids— so it seemed like only a matter of time before Apple caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTbuG8"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;order them from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F159302133&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-mini-blue%2F5902427.p%3FskuId%3D5902427&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with pick-ups available as soon as today and delivery dates available for this week, in Canada, Mexico, and the US. In China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan orders are also opening today, while availability is listed as “later this month” for Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats announces Fit Pro earbuds with wing tip design and $200 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocF-gwmGtLrClQFPhiePrHWRSns=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074042/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaG4LB"&gt;Beats today announced its latest wireless earbuds, the $199.99 Beats Fit Pro. The new product slots into the Apple-owned brand’s lineup between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt;, which were released earlier this year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;. The Fit Pros have active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and up to seven hours of continuous playback (or 30 hours of total listening when you include case recharges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpgqYB"&gt;The most noticeable thing about the new earbuds are the wing tips that are a permanent part of their design. Beats says it did a ton of research and user testing to land on the right material and level of flexibility. The wing tips are intended to help the Fit Pros stay locked in your ears no matter how strenuous your workout routine might be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nmQN76TlgSQxMzVwRK0kdTCUE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22975264/file.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have flexible, removable wing tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tidHHI"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which lacked Apple’s usual silicon inside, the Fit Pro buds include the H1 chip and thus come with the entire suite of features like one-step pairing, automatic syncing across your iCloud devices, auto switching between Apple hardware products, and more. They also include dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, and Beats even integrated the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r3zqvK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZZB-QSsEFg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHlMY1"&gt;The noise cancellation system is essentially the same as what’s on the AirPods Pro, so it should prove rather effective at quieting the outside world. When ANC and transparency mode are both off, the Fit Pro buds still use Apple’s Adaptive EQ to optimize audio performance based on your particular ear shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIOOFO"&gt;Beats will offer the Fit Pro earbuds in four colors: black, white, gray, and purple / pink. Preorders start today and they ship on November 5th. You don’t need to wait long to read the verdict on the latest Beats buds: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517199"&gt;I’ve been testing them for several days now&lt;/a&gt; and have found that they’re the company’s best, most focused product since the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPod Pros with better sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The latest Beats earbuds are the company’s best product since the Powerbeats Pro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nDxaBa"&gt;Beats has been busy. After releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, today the Apple-owned brand is back with the more premium Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds. It’s unusual to see two completely new products from Beats in a single year, but perhaps the company is trying to make a point that it’s not idly sitting by and playing second fiddle to Apple’s AirPods and AirPods Pro. If anything, the $200 Fit Pros demonstrate that Beats has found its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O44goa"&gt;The Fit Pros are a wonderfully designed pair of earbuds that integrate the best of Apple tech. They’ve got active noise cancellation that’s on par with the AirPods Pro. The same spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The same Adaptive EQ. They even have the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted in the third-generation AirPods. There’ve been many questions about where Beats fits into Apple’s long-term plans, and while a single product can’t really provide an answer to that, the Fit Pros are solid evidence that this brand isn’t being pushed to the wayside anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cPj7p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10835161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ9YjT"&gt;When I reviewed the Studio Buds, I praised their ambition and Beats’ attempt to cater to Android users as much as iPhone owners. But despite their great comfort, good sound, and compact design, those earbuds had some key missing features and fell a bit flat on execution. Not so with the Beats Fit Pros. They’re exactly what you’d want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXEoWH"&gt;These are the best earbuds Beats has ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ro362AyFIV-Gne_F-Aom3OwEGKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973215/DSCF6033_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have a permanent wing tip as part of their design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iFJoD"&gt;As Beats explains it, the Fit Pros are meant to fill a gap in its lineup between the Studio Buds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Their wing tips make them more gym-ready than the Studio Buds, but they don’t go as far as including the Powerbeats’ signature hooks that wrap around your ears. I have marathon runner friends who swear by the ear hooks and say nothing comes close to that stability for vigorous activity. But Beats thinks it has found a great alternative with the Fit Pros — all in a design that’s much more compact, lightweight, and comfortable than the Powerbeats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gtNz"&gt;The Fit Pros come in a case that’s basically a miniaturized version of the Powerbeats Pro case. Just as with those, there’s no wireless charging — a very frustrating omission at this price — but the case at least uses USB-C instead of Lightning. A longstanding gripe with the Powerbeats Pro is they can be finicky with charging unless you place them in the case just right. Their ear hooks make it easy to get this wrong, and on many occasions I’ve gone to use them only to find one earbud fully charged and the other completely drained. I’m happy to say this isn’t something you need to fret about with the Fit Pros: each earbud drops into its cradle with a reassuring magnetic pull and I’ve experienced zero charging mishaps. The lid has a little more play than I’d like, but I can be nitpicky about that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we1gy2"&gt;As for the buds themselves, they’ve got a unique look thanks to their permanent, curved wing tips. Beats is selling them in black, gray, white, and a pinkish purple. The gray and purple have gotten the best feedback among &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff. At 5.6 grams per earbud, they weigh in slightly heavier than the AirPods Pro but lighter than some fitness-geared buds like the Jaybird Vista 2s. The new Jabra Elite 7 Active buds are a hair lighter at 5.5 grams. Regardless, the Beats are extremely comfortable and also have microventing to alleviate ear pressure buildup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cfhDDBbzE9rbvau1NyEFEQBC4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973216/DSCF6032_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re designed for a secure, stable fit during active use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfmCQi"&gt;Beats is very proud of how much it crammed into the Fit Pros, which have the company’s smallest enclosure yet — not counting the wing tips, obviously. They contain 30 percent more components than the Studio Buds and the transducer is 15 percent larger. Three sizes of silicone ear tips come in the box, along with a short USB-C cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwNfcA"&gt;But what about those wing tips? They’re meant to help the earbuds stay put. But I’ve found that on some earbuds, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMKgWMO3fu8"&gt;the second-gen Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;, these wing tips and numbs can cause discomfort the longer you wear them, so there’s definitely a risk in Beats making them a permanent part of the design. But the company says it sweated the details over the wing’s shape and material. And after several days spent testing the Fit Pros — often for several hours at a time — I haven’t noticed any soreness. The wing tip is flexible and pliable enough that it doesn’t press into the concha of your ear in an annoying way. You’ll feel it there during extended listening, don’t get me wrong, but at most it produces a little itchiness instead of more serious irritation. And you can alleviate that just by adjusting the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqULYd7Vneck60NRlyx1aucD5Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973267/DSCF6021_Edited_2.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case disappointingly lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Syd1jUW8K0nbniLo10_UbyMk_2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973219/DSCF6026_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s much smaller and more pocketable than the Powerbeats Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S5XkUB"&gt;Beats says it designed the wing tips for “every ear imaginable,” but ears are all different, and there will always be exceptions. That said, I let several people try the Fit Pros and even those with small ears could find a way to make the wing tip work for them and said it resulted in a more steady overall fit. They passed the gym test and didn’t come even slightly loose during high intensity runs. They also stayed in while eating, something that’s a challenge for many earbuds. The Fit Pros are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, which is adequate for workout purposes, but below the IP57 of Jabra’s latest active buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbL4uu"&gt;Like the Studio Buds, these have a nice and clicky “b” button on each earbud with the usual control scheme: press once to play / pause / answer call, twice to skip to the next track, and three times to go back. But there’s one interesting tidbit: for the first time, you can remap a long press to adjust volume instead of toggling noise cancellation or summoning Siri. This can be done right in the iOS settings menu and is something that the AirPods Pro can’t do, nor can the Beats Studio Buds. I like having the option, even if I ended up sticking with the defaults. Bring that remapping capability to your other earbuds, Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88pUIZ"&gt;Beats has outfitted its latest earbuds with 9.5mm drivers, and they produce very satisfying sound quality that I’d rank above the AirPods Pro. This isn’t the bloated bass Beats of old: the company shed that reputation quite a long time ago. The Fit Pro buds might have slightly less overall boom and oomph than the Powerbeats Pros, in fact, but switching back and forth between the two, it was close — and I preferred the more refined sound of the newer buds. If there’s one weakness I’ve noticed, it’s maximum volume. The Fit Pros seem to have a lower volume ceiling than some of their competitors, so if you tend to crank things up for motivation during a run or fitness routine, you might be underwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fit Pros also come in black or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5DKkh"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which didn’t have Apple’s usual earbud chipset inside, the Fit Pros have the H1 and all the features that come along with that. The main benefits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SUW64G"&gt;Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7PiN2B"&gt;Automatic device switching between iPhone, iPad, and Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ks3YKH"&gt;Automatic syncing with all of your iCloud devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JVHpWj"&gt;Audio sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1kp8M"&gt;Find My integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ek848h"&gt;Hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JFeJdA"&gt;Beats notes that a lot of other functionality — ANC, transparency mode, one-step setup, Apple Music spatial audio (minus head tracking) — works just as well on Android as on iOS. You’ll need the Beats app for some things like control customization and more detailed battery status. The Studio Buds supported Android’s native Fast Pair feature, but the Fit Pros do not. That’s not surprising considering there’s once again Apple silicon inside. But it means that there’s an extra layer of seamlessness when using the Fit Pros within Apple’s ecosystem. You can get most of the way there on Android, but not quite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LodQQX"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the Fit Pros essentially have the same noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro — also powered by the H1 chip. Performance between the two is more or less identical, and transparency mode sounds natural here in the same way it does on the Pros (with the same sound effects as you switch between modes). When ANC is off, Beats refers to this as “Adaptive EQ” mode. That’s where you’ll get the best battery life: seven hours of continuous playback and up to 30 hours including case recharges. Using ANC or transparency drops those figures to six hours and 27 hours, respectively, so you’re not losing much no matter how you’re using the buds. Beats says you’ll get an hour of playback (with ANC) from a quick five-minute top off, and fully recharging both earbuds and the case takes around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwSNeI81-knRJSxigKLlbqVaLcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973283/DSCF6031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wing tips rarely cause any discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFH6b"&gt;The Fit Pro buds also include Apple’s new skin detect sensor, first seen in the latest AirPods, for more accurate automatic play / pause when removed from your ears. This sensor can tell the difference between skin and other tight confines like pant pockets, so the earbuds are less likely to resume playing when you don’t want them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0axW5"&gt;Voice call performance is quite good but falls short of the AirPods. If you’re wearing one of the earbuds alone, three mics are used for voice calls. When both earbuds are in use, the voice system leverages five mics. The Fit Pros utilize beamforming mics and voice detection algorithms to help isolate your voice from background commotion. My co-workers heard me loud and clear on Zoom calls, and people I chatted with on the phone said I sounded fine, if slightly less pronounced as when using the AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8auFU5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10838399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ggRvHJ"&gt;The Fit Pros successfully thread the needle between everyday and fitness-focused earbuds. They’re objectively a better choice than the AirPods Pro for workouts and running, and they handle more casual listening equally as well. They improve upon the lackluster noise cancellation that dragged down the Studio Buds, and they restore Apple’s full arsenal of ecosystem tricks. They also bring back features that Beats left out last time like in-ear detection. Making wing tips part of the core design was a gamble, and there will no doubt be cases where that decision causes issues for some people. All I can say is these are among the most comfortable wing tips I’ve ever had in my ears — and they succeed at their purpose of keeping the Fit Pros locked in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ink9Ul"&gt;If you already own a set of AirPods or bought the Studio Buds earlier this year, these aren’t a must have. But if you’ve been searching for something worthy of replacing your Powerbeats Pro, the Beats Fit Pro might just be the ticket. They’re the sporty AirPod Pros a lot of people have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can adjust location services for specific apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSpH0kbFBBPq3Pdd52RfatmGL9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857412/IMG_13B4445EF110_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust location services for specific apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How you can allow location access depends on the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpBbvHInOumIiH0y2cORf5Nv3bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857413/IMG_6D2F84330D37_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BI4ULPUOLpp4D6EXdpLY1UeSoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857589/IMG_11AB5BCB37D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaDFmh"&gt;(Note: For some reason, the “Share Until End of Day” selection seems to always select midnight Pacific Time rather than the end of day local time. For example, I’m on Eastern Time, and so “end of day” is always somewhere around 3AM. I’ve reached out to Apple to find out if they have a fix for this and will let you know if / when I hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking policy reportedly cost social media platforms nearly $10 billion</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODq4yfj5scuSF17cA4aH0w65c7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70072075/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hoTDKd"&gt;An investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c19e387-ee1a-41d8-8dd2-bc6c302ee58e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube lost around $9.85 billion in revenue following Apple’s changes to its privacy practices. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy&lt;/a&gt; that requires apps to ask permission to track users’ data. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;policy went into effect in April&lt;/a&gt;, barring apps from tracking users if they opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoOi1y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;Facebook notably criticized the move with a full-page newspaper ad&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report, now we know why company leaders were so frustrated. According to the report, Facebook lost the most money “in absolute terms” when compared to other social platforms due to its massive size. Meanwhile, Snap “fared the worst as a percentage of its business” because its advertising is mainly tied to smartphones, which makes sense for a product that doesn’t have a desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sje4f6"&gt;“Some of the platforms that were most impacted — but especially Facebook — have to rebuild their machinery from scratch as a result of ATT,” adtech consultant Eric Seufert told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;. “My belief is that it takes at least one year to build new infrastructure. New tools and frameworks need to be developed from scratch and tested extensively before being deployed to a high number of users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahNYi"&gt;Apple’s new policy will force social platforms and other apps to get more creative with their advertising. Whether this means focusing on Android devices or investing in Apple’s advertising business — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654121/apple-personalized-ads-ios-15-prompt-app-tracking"&gt;which nearly broke its own rules&lt;/a&gt; by quietly collecting user data in the same way third-party apps did —  they’ll have to figure out another source of revenue that doesn’t involve tracking people on their iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKAdRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZxYO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
