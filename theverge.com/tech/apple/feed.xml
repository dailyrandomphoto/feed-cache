    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Trabhq"&gt;Apple is announcing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F13%2F22228580%2Fapple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the next big investments&lt;/a&gt; to come out of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287999/apple-racial-equity-justice-initiative-amount-cook-lisa-jackson"&gt;$100 million commitment to racial equity and justice today&lt;/a&gt;: the launch of an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit; founding support for an Atlanta tech hub for historically Black colleges and universities; and new grants, scholarships, and investments for Black and brown students and entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxDIzQ"&gt;The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit will be the “first of its kind in the US,” Apple wrote in a press release, after previously partnering on &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/16/apple-developer-academy/"&gt;a similar program&lt;/a&gt; in Italy. The academy is focused on “young Black entrepreneurs, creators, and coders” and will offer training in iOS app development. The plan is to offer a shorter 30-day program that introduces students to “what it means to be a developer” and then to offer an “intensive” 10- to 12- month program meant to help aspiring developers gain relevant skills to get tech jobs or start their own businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="g6ARRI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Propel Center will offer in-person and online courses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WgMimC"&gt;Apple expects the academy to teach around 1,000 students each year. It’s supposed to open later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QmSuM"&gt;In Atlanta, Apple is partnering to help launch the Propel Center, a tech-focused hub for HBCUs. The center will offer in-person and online courses focused on technology, entertainment, and business. It’ll be located in the Atlanta University Center that links four HBCUs — Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Apple and Southern Company, an Atlanta-based energy giant, will each contribute $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P64QZI"&gt;Other tech companies and major donors have made similar contributions to HBCUs over the past year. In September, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-09-17-IBM-Establishes-First-Quantum-Education-and-Research-Initiative-for-Historically-Black-Colleges-and-Universities"&gt;IBM announced&lt;/a&gt; it was putting $100 million into technology, skill development, and other resources for HBCUs alongside the launch of an “IBM Quantum education and research initiative.” The same month, Michael Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/business/dealbook/bloomberg-black-medical-schools-donation.html"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to give $100 million to four historically Black medical schools, focused on easing student debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ew5eF"&gt;Apple also announced a number of new grants and investments today. It’s investing $10 million with Harlem Capital, a VC firm with the goal of “investing in 1,000 diverse founders over the next 20 years,” and $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund, which is focused on minority-owned businesses. Apple is launching grants for HBCU engineering programs and is expanding its scholarship program with a focus on underrepresented communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZlE5d"&gt;Today’s announcements are part of a $100 million commitment Apple made in June 2020, as companies across the US began reflecting on how they could better combat racism following the death of George Floyd and protests against police brutality. Apple VP Lisa Jackson was put in charge of the initiative, which was meant to “challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exists for communities of color and particular for the black community,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn6s6v"&gt;Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;have made similar pledges&lt;/a&gt;, putting millions of dollars toward racial equity initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive: Apple held talks with EV startup Canoo in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbwGAeCNL-Dc9hiPI5oafigJnsA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658125/canoo_Design_Exterior_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOxNU7"&gt;Apple held meetings with California EV startup Canoo in the first half of 2020 as part of the Silicon Valley giant’s secretive effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;advance its own electric vehicle project&lt;/a&gt;, three people familiar with the talks have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The two companies discussed options ranging from investment to an acquisition, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcBkxi"&gt;Canoo’s scalable electric vehicle platform, or “skateboard,” is largely what drew Apple’s interest, the people said. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9bfWU"&gt;Canoo was more interested in taking on an investment from Apple, two of the people said. Ultimately, the talks fell apart. Canoo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;since become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;blank check fund&lt;/a&gt; that was listed on the NASDAQ in late 2020. Apple has made at least one other acquisition in the mobility space in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;buying Drive.ai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq1mYL"&gt;“Canoo doesn’t openly comment on strategic discussions, relationships or partnerships unless deemed appropriate,” Tony Aquila, Canoo’s executive chairman, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rcEe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The talks happened at a crucial financial moment for Canoo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7BVy8"&gt;News of Apple’s interest in Canoo comes as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the tech company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-set-to-agree-electric-car-tie-up-says-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1"&gt;negotiating with Hyundai to make a self-driving electric vehicle as early as 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s vehicle project, codenamed “Project Titan,” has shapeshifted multiple times over the years. But the company has now &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly refocused on making an autonomous electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has been holding meetings with automakers as small as Canoo and as big as Hyundai as it looks to outsource things like technical design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ostxcV"&gt;Hyundai and Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;previously announced a plan to co-develop electric vehicles in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that project appears to be unrelated to the startup’s talks with Apple. Canoo refers to its partnership with Hyundai in recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an “engineering services agreement” that will see the companies co-develop a platform to power a “small segment electric vehicle.” But Canoo has not disclosed whether it has been paid for the Hyundai deal, or whether any work has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1sE4y"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a small group that split out from struggling EV startup Faraday Future, including multiple former BMW executives. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported, the effort was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;a Chinese investor who is the son-in-law of a former CCP leader&lt;/a&gt;, and the family in charge of Taiwanese tech company TPK, which supplies touchscreen technology to Apple. Canoo plans to make commercial electric vehicles, like delivery vans or food trucks, as well as a consumer-focused van that will be sold on a subscription basis. All of Canoo’s vehicles are powered by that same scalable skateboard technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THdRzC"&gt;The talks with Apple came at a crucial time for Canoo, which lost $182.3 million in 2019 while working on its first prototype vehicle and entered 2020 with just $29 million in the bank, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm#TOC001"&gt;a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tB6p7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo met with companies and investors across Silicon Valley and China before going public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCWDDY"&gt;Canoo took meetings with a variety of companies from Silicon Valley, China, and elsewhere in 2019 and 2020, the people said. But as deals failed to materialize, the startup needed short-term money. It took a $7 million loan from the government’s pandemic Paycheck Protection Program and, as talks with Apple dragged on, another $15 million total from Pak Tam Li (the Chinese investor) and the Chiang family (the owners of TPK) in March 2020, according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAYXs"&gt;Canoo eventually started negotiations with the blank check fund, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, later in the year. It was one of the first startups to jump on this trend of using a so-called “special purpose acquisition company” to shortcut the traditional path to becoming publicly traded. As that deal was worked out, the Chiang family put another $80 million into the startup, and the soon-to-be executive chairman invested $35 million, according to the SEC filing. Canoo raised some $600 million when the deal closed near the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUb0V0"&gt;While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KugtI1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-965" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2F-%2F6394628.p%3Fu1%3D%255B%255Dvg%255Be%255D21988756%255Br%255Dtheverge.com%252Fauthors%255Bt%255Dw%255Bd%255DD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>PopSockets are going MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqLxpCKYCBBhu2JRX1hanIDgQxw=/0x20:552x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652647/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PopSockets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iUXKXO"&gt;PopSockets is announcing that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/popsockets-unveils-innovation-at-ces-2021-including-magsafe-solutions-301205556.html"&gt;making its iconic phone holders compatible with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;. When Apple announced that accessories would be able to attach to the iPhone 12 with MagSafe, many people immediately thought of PopSockets — including &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/popsockets-is-working-on-magsafe-compatible-iphone-accessories/"&gt;the company itself&lt;/a&gt;, which announced it was working on adding compatibility. Now, it’s finally at the point where it’s putting out an announcement and a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keD1sS"&gt;PopSockets is planning on bringing MagSafe to quite a few of its products, but first, of course, is the famous &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsockets.com%2Fshop%2Fpopgrip&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225701%2Fpopsockets-magsafe-accessory#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you want to charge your phone wirelessly, you won’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21048205/popsockets-poppower-home-wireless-charger-popgrip-ces-2020"&gt;buy PopSockets’ specialized wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. The MagSafe version will have a larger base than many PopSockets users may be used to, which is probably to provide space for the “no-slip” rubber bottom. Hopefully, that will keep the PopSocket from sliding off when going in and out of your pocket, like Apple’s own MagSafe wallet is somewhat infamous for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm7Iga"&gt;Speaking of wallets, PopSockets is also announcing a magnetic version of its PopWallet Plus, which is essentially a wallet with a PopSocket built in. Like Apple’s version, it will include a shield meant to protect any cards that are liable to get erased by magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRW3XF"&gt;In addition, PopSockets is unveiling two mounts that will use MagSafe: one for home (dubbed “Multi-Surface) and one for the car. The company notes that the new PopGrips will work with existing PopSocket mounts, but the new mounts will work magnetically, though it’s not clear if they’ll also use the PopSocket as an extra mechanical grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiGw4z"&gt;The press announcement had some other notable products, including an antimicrobial version of the PopGrip (it’s a sign of the times), and a multitool PopGrip that’s a collaboration with famed knifesmith SOG. The PopGrip and PopWallet Plus for MagSafe are slated to launch in spring of 2021, and the PopMounts should be coming in the summer. No word has been released on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s second MagSafe dock drops the Apple Watch charger and the price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EazKyFOGOUrWVsR6XKEG2a6VMAU=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650761/2in1_MagSafe_lifestyle2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mapDzk"&gt;Since Apple’s reveal of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe charging standard&lt;/a&gt;, officially approved wireless chargers that use the standard have been few and far between. But Belkin is boosting those numbers with its new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger, which also brings a more palatable $99.95 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfEv2n"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 3-in-1 Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger — as you might be able to already guess — can charge two products instead of three. Now, the futuristic charging tree will offer just a MagSafe pad and a regular Qi charger for your AirPods (or any other device that fits), dropping the Apple Watch charger found on the 3-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aRpqEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Belkin’s first MagSafe products are a wild-looking 3-in-1 charger and a car mount","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NhmgKk"&gt;And like the 3-in-1, the new BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 is an official, MFi-approved MagSafe device, meaning that it’s one of the few options out there for taking advantage of MagSafe’s faster 15W wireless charger. And the one-third reduction in functionality comes with a similar reduction in price: the BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 costs $99.95, compared to the $149.95 that Belkin charges for its larger counterpart. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-ir9R3QUca94OebYXITs2Was38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223074/2in1_MagSafe_poduct1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FSJGEm"&gt;The BoostCharge Pro MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charger is set to release later this year in March or April, when it’ll be available from both Apple’s and Belkin’s websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu5QuD"&gt;Along with the new wireless charger, Belkin also announced its second set of wireless earbuds, the Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds. Where the original Soundform True Wireless Earbuds were a budget option at $59.99 (with features to match), Belkin is aiming higher with the Soundform Freedom buds. The new buds feature better battery life (up to eight hours, with an additional 20 hours in the case), USB-C charging, and improved isolation of background noise (although there’s no active noise cancellation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4ImBC"&gt;Notably, the Soundform Freedom earbuds will also be one of the first third-party products to work with Apple’s Find My network (something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be offering as an option last year). That means that — similar to Apple’s own AirPods — you’ll be able to use the Find My app on iPhone and Mac devices to locate your missing headphones, using the same crowdsourced network of Apple products that the company’s own first-party devices can use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RUSrMG9eWnhkTtTj2kQEj2wfpHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223076/SoundForm_Freedom_white1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o8kwuy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbeTlx"&gt;The Soundform Freedom earbuds also offer both Qi and USB-C charging, swappable ear tips, and are rated IPX5 for sweat and splash resistance. Belkin has yet to announce pricing, but they’ll be available to purchase sometime in March or April. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The fourth-gen Amazon Echo Dot looks more like a ball and less like a dot. | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a4eq7M"&gt;The new ball-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker#:~:text=It%20provides%20excellent%20sound%20quality,is%20easy%20to%20stick%20in"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, which was released last year, was frequently discounted over the holiday season. If you missed those deals and are looking to grab two Echo Dots, Amazon is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a703bc6b8141b27e290f322ffa1dd1f6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $50&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DOT2PACK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-LIFESTYLE-MEDIA-POLITICS-PARLER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i_F4Eg6ZlMTQaAXK1I89g16EjQ=/6x0:3995x2659/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648550/1225872885.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler has been taken offline&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HH3EVI"&gt;After Parler was banned on both the Apple and Google app stores for failing to curb violent and threatening content on its platform, the social media site is now completely offline as a result of Amazon terminating Parler’s web hosting services. The official Parler website now returns a 403 error, while its app is showing networking errors and can’t load content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler of its decision&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, in a letter to chief policy officer Amy Peikoff. Its Amazon Web Service (AWS) “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to Peikoff states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idJlPKDKDtg5Y6-ZthZ4Tw5JyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227121/File.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Parler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler’s iOS app, which now can’t load content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApEuFA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the Wednesday attack on the Capitol that left five people dead were circulated on other platforms in the wake of the riot. An example:  “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” to which another poster replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ruz0"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21986678%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;saw its user numbers spike&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler’s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW8lXP"&gt;When it pulled Parler from the Play Store, Google said while reasonable debate about content policy was possible, and it can be hard for apps to remove violative content immediately, “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.” Apple told the company that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XKD0V"&gt;Even with the app removed from the Play Store users could still install Parler on their Android devices by downloading it directly from Parler’s website and sideloading it. However, with its AWS services now disabled, the website and apps no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZnHsY"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze — who, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22223335%2Fparler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; worked for AWS for three months in 2017 — wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds [sic] last hope for free speech and free information.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DXYq9"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there was no coordination with any other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; that the Parler could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze added, “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;Perhaps the best-known recent instance of a site being deplatformed for violent content was social network Gab. After a gunman killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/pittsburgh-funerals-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic threats on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google booted Gab app from its Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;Parler has not responded to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IrVWh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th 5:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Locked Down, Supernova, Losing Alice and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9x2PLzyePPgRp-fp7_M55YKCMI=/249x0:1559x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68646979/lockd_donwn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway star in Locked Down | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mepeWor5JPk&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9nKl7i"&gt;So with all the chaos of the past week, you may have missed that Friday was the final episode of Jeopardy! with Alex Trebek as host. Trebek, who died in November at age 80 after a battle with cancer, hosted the answer-and-question game show for 37 years. The show posted a best-of highlight reel of Trebek’s performances over the years (remember the brouhaha when he shaved his mustache?!) and it may make you tear up a bit. My favorite appreciation of Trebek was from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/arts/television/alex-trebek-jeopardy.html"&gt;James Poniewozik in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which concludes: “He was our trusted man with the answers, even in times when reality came to us in the form of a question.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCCKAb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arsStQAhHVA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SMqPc8"&gt;Out new trailers this week range from dark and creepy to quirky to unsettling (which, to be totally honest, I prefer all of the above to syrupy holiday movies). Let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT4tGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="siXO2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zfSw7G1A-0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nPRlag"&gt;Losing Alice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="B6zDpi"&gt;A movie director fretting about her age meets a mysterious screenwriter on a train, and the two are drawn into a weird relationship. Love a good noir movie. Losing Alice was written and directed by Sigal Avin. Ayelet Zurer and Lihi Kornowski star in the eight-episode streaming series which premieres on Apple TV Plus January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8SO7io"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mepeWor5JPk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0UP4au"&gt;Locked Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2uUN"&gt;Look I just love Anne Hathaway so I’m willing to give anything she’s in at least a chance. A couple quarantining together during the pandemic just after they decide to break up, meh, OK. But &lt;em&gt;plot twist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;they also plan a jewelry heist at Harrod’s department store to steal a bazillion-dollar diamond. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I’m on board. Chiwetel Ejiofor (another fave) also stars in&lt;em&gt; Locked Down&lt;/em&gt;, which hits HBO Max January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EwnqT0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_62BeXxd_jo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jIFZHK"&gt;Derek DelGaudio’s In &amp;amp; Of Itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DttZwT"&gt;What is this weirdness about? Put simply, it’s a one-man show by Derek DelGuadio, who describes himself as a “storyteller and conceptual magician.” &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/in-of-itself-review-derek-delgaudio-frank-oz-sxsw-1202217981/"&gt;IndieWire’s review&lt;/a&gt; says it’s a blend of “stage trickery and alluring autobiographical asides,” that’s also a “meditation on existential yearning.” Hey I’m down for whatever. Directed by Frank Oz and executive-produced by Stephen Colbert (yep and yep!), &lt;em&gt;In &amp;amp; of Itself&lt;/em&gt; hits Hulu January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KgvaOq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRz2hY6ykGE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Cowg3v"&gt;Supernova&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbpC9g"&gt;Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth star as a partners of 20 years traveling across England to visit family and friends. It’s not just a beautiful road trip movie, though; Tucci’s character Tusker has dementia and is slowly losing his memory, so the pair are acutely aware of the value of the time they have left together. &lt;em&gt;Supernova&lt;/em&gt; is slated to hit theaters January 29th, with a “digital release” February 16th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes Parler from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1zEUh9OTr-kmE8w5ICh-zXLQLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68644631/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jYBDmZ"&gt;Apple has removed Parler from the App Store, following accusations that the social media app was fostering calls to violence ahead of, and following, the raid on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sczRDR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,” reads a statement from the company on Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMGX2M"&gt;Apple issued an ultimatum to Parler on Friday demanding that it remove content in violation with its policies and provide a plan on how it would moderate content moving forward, which was &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler?bftwnews&amp;amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said Parler had 24 hours to make the changes or else it would be removed from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFq69X"&gt;Apparently, Parler did propose some changes, but Apple decided they weren’t sufficient, according to a statement Apple sent to Parler alongside its final decision to remove the app. It states that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,” and that Parler will not return to the App Store until it has “demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbl08K"&gt;Here’s the full statement as provided by Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fbXilX"&gt;To the developers of the Parler app,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yubcZL"&gt;Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasLJX"&gt;Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9VKNj"&gt;In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfOJuv"&gt;Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwSxC1"&gt;For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ySL7W"&gt;Regards, App Review Board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3Vis3k"&gt;The app was briefly still available on Apple’s store after we received the statement, but it disappeared from the store a number of minutes after we published this post. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the app jumped up to #1 on the App Store and may have gained hundreds of thousands of users between the time Apple issued its 24-hour ultimatum and when the company pulled it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f16mNP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google pulled Parler&lt;/a&gt; Friday evening. “We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,” Google said in a statement. “We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74XGOB"&gt;Both Apple and Google faced pressure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt; to deplatform Parler, which is known for being conservative-friendly and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;having less stringent moderation&lt;/a&gt; than other social media platforms. The removal of both apps comes after a mob attack Wednesday on the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. On Friday, Amy Piekoff, head of policy at Parler, &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221435493001#sp=show-clips"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a ban from the App Store would be “huge,” adding that if it Apple removed Parler “we’re toast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daAZBG"&gt;Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/7a9ba1df6d0949f2996dd7d5f13b1b49"&gt;posted a statement on Parler&lt;/a&gt; accusing Apple of applying a “horrible double standard” in its decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URthnz"&gt;“Apple, Google and the rest of the anti-competitive pack of big tech tyrants coordinate their moves and work together to stifle competition in the marketplace,” he wrote. Matze added more details would be coming soon about Parler’s plans “as we have many options.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjzs5v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th, 8:58PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Parler CEO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaBW2Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbyNph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPWAQQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media and telco companies urged to preserve evidence from Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYx6LN5QqKIZvEdN5raw-DLZWmA=/25x0:2016x1327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643477/GettyImages_1230453521.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Rioters breached security at the Capitol on Wednesday January 6th | Photo by Olivier Douliery / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7aoZXg"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), incoming chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is asking mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve “content and associated metadata” that may be  connected to the attack on the US Capitol. Warner said in a statement Saturday that he contacted the CEOs of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Apple, Facebook, Gab, Google, Parler, Signal, Telegram, and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4VTOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The United States Capitol is now a crime scene,” Warner &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22224462/capitol_attack_twitter.pdf"&gt;wrote in his letters&lt;/a&gt;. “The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are currently investigating the events of that day, and trying to piece together what happened and the perpetrators involved. The prospect of litigation on behalf of the victims of the mayhem also is highly likely. Messaging data to and from your subscribers that may have participated in, or assisted, those engaged in this insurrection – and associated subscriber information – are critical evidence in helping to bring these rioters to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yemBp"&gt;Warner noted that many of those participating in the January 6th attack that left five people dead posted images to social media, or shared them via text and mobile messaging platforms while the riot was underway and afterward, “to celebrate their disdain for our democratic process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTUI64"&gt;All the named companies routinely comply with &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/digitaldiscovery/library/preservation/preservationanalysis.html"&gt;court-issued preservation orders&lt;/a&gt;, issued during criminal investigations. But Warner’s letter is an informal request, without the legal force of a criminal preservation order, and it is unclear how the companies will respond. Court-issued preservation orders are often issued under seal so it is also possible that one of the many agencies investigating the Capitol raid has already issued such an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVn9sb"&gt;We’ve reached out to the companies to ask how and if they plan to comply with Warner’s request and will update if we hear back from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhFLv8"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “continuing our ongoing, proactive outreach to law enforcement and have worked to quickly provide responses to valid legal requests. We are removing content, disabling accounts, and working with law enforcement to protect against direct threats to public safety.” T-Mobile acknowledged it had received Warner’s letter. “As always, we will fully cooperate with requests from law enforcement,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HhUjv"&gt;To reiterate, however, Warner’s request doesn’t carry quite the same legal weight as a subpoena or other formal request from a law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8fHkL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/capitol-riot-democrats-social-media-456325"&gt;Warner told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that following Wednesday’s attack, Congress would “come back with a vengeance” against social media platforms that were unable to rein in violent content and threats on their platforms. “This is going to come back and bite ‘em,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJb7nH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 1:15PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mY9cWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 9th 3:43PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from T-Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
