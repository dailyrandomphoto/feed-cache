    <title>The shareholder fight that forced Apple’s hand on repair rights</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;A repair tutorial from iFixit shows a user accessing the internal electronics of an iPhone | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928?vgo_ee=3bheJeT%2FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aANBG1"&gt;Wednesday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company will soon make parts and repair manuals available to the general public, reversing years of restrictive repair policies. The new policy represents a seismic shift for a company that has fought independent repair for years by restricting access to parts, manuals, and diagnostic tools, designing products that are difficult to fix, and lobbying against laws that would enshrine the right to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHPqCC"&gt;But Apple didn’t change its policy out of the goodness of its heart. The announcement follows months of growing pressure from repair activists and regulators — and its timing seems deliberate, considering a &lt;a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-shareholder-proposal-presses-apple-to-expand-access-to-repair/"&gt;shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; environmental advocates filed with the company in September asking Apple to re-evaluate its stance on independent repair. Wednesday is a key deadline in the fight over the resolution, with advocates poised to bring the issue to the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdtzSp"&gt;Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the program “has been in development for well over a year,” describing it as “the next step in increasing customer access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and manuals.” Leahy declined to say whether the timing of the announcement was influenced by shareholder pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nffZMT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WLSKQt"&gt;Activist shareholders believe that it was.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The timing is definitely no coincidence,” says Annalisa Tarizzo, an advocate with Green Century, the mutual fund company that filed the right-to-repair resolution with Apple in September. As a result of today’s announcement, Green Century is withdrawing its resolution, which asked Apple to “reverse its anti repair practices” and evaluate the benefits of making parts and tools more available to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4PEX"&gt;That’s exactly what Apple seems to be doing with its new Self Service Repair program. Announced this morning, the program will allow members of the general public to order genuine Apple parts in order to make basic iPhone repairs at home — something Apple has long argued is too dangerous for individuals to do. According to Apple, Self Service Repair will initially focus on the display, battery, and camera for iPhone 12 and 13 models. Individuals interested in doing screen repairs or battery replacements for those models at home will be able to place an order for genuine Apple parts through a new Apple Self Service Repair Online Store, send in their old part for recycling, and receive a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqNaBN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAhiz"&gt;Apple’s announcement of the program is light on details, including whether the program will be expanded beyond iPhone 12 and 13 as well as Mac computers using M1 chips, how much genuine parts will cost customers, and whether it will eventually make parts available for a wider range of repairs. Although the announcement implies it will, Leahy declined to confirm that the program will eventually be expanded to other iPhone models. Still, the announcement effectively fulfills Green Century’s request that Apple make significant changes to its repair policies to facilitate independent repair — assuming the tech giant follows through with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byZEva"&gt;Apple’s initial response to the Green Century resolution was less than conciliatory. Tarizzo says that on October 18 (30 days before the self service announcement), Apple submitted a “no action request” to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking the investor oversight body to block the proposal. According to Tarizzo, Apple’s argument before the SEC was that the proposal — that the company “prepare a report” on the environmental and social benefits of making its devices easier to fix — ran afoul of shareholder proposal guidance by infringing on Apple’s normal business operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gHGaA"&gt;However, earlier this month, the SEC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/staff-legal-bulletin-14l-shareholder-proposals"&gt;issued new guidance&lt;/a&gt; concerning no-action requests that includes a carve-out for proposals that raise “significant social policy issues.” In other words, shareholders &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; bring resolutions that affect a company’s day-to-day business operations if those proposals raise issues with significant societal impact. Tarizzo believes that this change made it much more likely the SEC would side with Green Century rather than Apple, particularly since the mutual fund company connected the dots between increased access to repair and the fight against climate change. (Using devices as long as possible through maintenance and repair is &lt;a href="https://debugger.medium.com/apples-new-iphone-is-far-from-green-1803f4f9a58a"&gt;one of the best ways to reduce the climate impact&lt;/a&gt; of consumer technology since the majority of the emissions associated with our gadgets occur during the manufacturing stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1Dj9C"&gt;“It wasn’t a guarantee that the SEC would side with us, but the new guidance indicates it’s very likely we would prevail,” Tarizzo says. “It effectively took away a lot of Apple’s leverage in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jX8BDL"&gt;Now, Apple seems to have regained some leverage by announcing its new Self Service Repair program on the same day that Green Century was required to respond to the no-action request. Instead of arguing that the SEC should allow the shareholder resolution to move forward, Green Century is now withdrawing the resolution entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpEfic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZNN0P"&gt;Companies routinely ignore shareholder resolutions, and many had assumed Apple would respond to Green Century’s resolution the same way — but it came at a time of unique momentum for the right-to-repair cause. This year, a &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/half-us-states-looking-give-americans-right-repair"&gt;record 27 states&lt;/a&gt; have considered right to repair bills, and the first national right to repair bill was introduced to Congress &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/news/usp/broad-right-repair-bill-introduced-congress"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. None have passed into law, but they’ve sent an alarming message to companies like Apple that restrictive repair practices may not be legal for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Iwf5"&gt;That’s also resulted in pressure from the federal government. In May, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/should-customers-be-able-to-repair-their-devices-this-federal-agency-says-yes/"&gt;came out strongly in favor of independent repair&lt;/a&gt; with the release of a report finding “scant evidence” to justify restrictions imposed by companies like Apple. In July, President Biden himself &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the FTC to craft new regulations that would limit the ability of cell phone makers to restrict DIY repair. Those rules are a long way from coming into effect, but the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-ramp-law-enforcement-against-illegal-repair-restrictions"&gt;specter of looming regulations&lt;/a&gt; was certainly a factor in Apple’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syQVvj"&gt;Some of Apple’s biggest competitors have already embraced right-to-repair policies, adding even more pressure on the company. Last month, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to comply with a first-of-its-kind right-to-repair resolution brought by environmental nonprofit &lt;em&gt;As You Sow &lt;/em&gt;in June. The resolution asked Microsoft to study the environmental and social benefits of increasing access to repair; Microsoft not only agreed to conduct such a study but to act on the findings by the end of 2022. Microsoft’s concession to activist shareholders came on the heels of Green Century filing a similar shareholder resolution with Apple, a move activists speculated could pressure on the iPhone maker to respond in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="niFteq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66i69y"&gt;The result is a huge victory for Green Century and a validation for shareholder activism more broadly. Tarizzo says that while Apple’s new program “doesn’t go all the way where we want the company to go, we think it’s a significant enough step that it warrants a withdrawal. The fact they’ll be selling common replacement parts, tools, releasing repair manuals, it’s all very much in the spirit of what we were hoping to see happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Jw4g"&gt;While Tarizzo feels that the timing of Apple’s announcement is directly related to Green Century’s shareholder resolution, she believes the company’s about-face on independent repair is “really the product of the combined pressure of all sides of the right-to-repair movement” from federal action to statehouse bills to grassroots advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V0KOE"&gt;Nathan Proctor, the senior right to repair campaign director at the US Public Research Interest Group, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXq9yf"&gt;“If I was to hazard a guess, it would be the whole compilation of the campaign has successfully changed Apple’s position,” Proctor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I don’t think you can point to any one particular thing that was done that made it happen. It all made it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will sell you iPhone parts to fix your own phone at home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cG_qw6mF0FCWwz8VDwJ9he1CJkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154312/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyEEYp"&gt;Apple is opening up iPhones and Macs to DIY repairs. The company plans to &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;start selling parts and tools&lt;/a&gt; and offering instructions on how to repair Apple products at home, without having to bring them into a store or a third-party repair shop. Apple plans to start with the iPhone 12 and 13, followed by Macs with M1 chips. You’ll be able to replace the iPhone’s display, battery, and camera using parts from Apple at first, with other options coming later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZtWhO"&gt;This is a huge shift from Apple, which has historically been resistant to the right-to-repair movement and from any repairs happening outside of its own stores. Even this week, Apple was walking back software that prevented Face ID from working if customers replaced their own screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6LQLi5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit celebrated the move but noted some substantial caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TXbQYL"&gt;Apple is calling the program “Self Service Repair,” and it’ll launch “early next year” in the US and then expand to other countries. The company says the program is only meant for “individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices” and that most customers should still go to a professional. But Apple is at least now offering an option for the customers who do feel comfortable undertaking the repair on their own. Critically, making these repairs yourself won’t void a device’s warrant, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although damaging your device in the process still might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1h2738"&gt;The change also helps to further entrench Apple in the repair process. The company already has a program to sell “genuine” parts to third-party repair shops, and today’s announcement makes it all the more likely customers will buy full-priced parts from Apple — parts that won’t trip off iPhone systems that try to prevent the use of components that weren’t bought from Apple — rather than looking for aftermarket options in the limited circumstances where that might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3htcR"&gt;iFixit, the go-to resource for DIY repair parts and instructions, &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/55370/apple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software"&gt;celebrated the move&lt;/a&gt; but noted that it came with substantial caveats. Apple’s decision is “a remarkable concession to our collective competency” and invalidates many of the arguments that Apple and other companies have made against right to repair, writes Elizabeth Chamberlain, iFixit’s director of sustainability. But Chamberlain notes that this still isn’t “the open-source repair revolution we’ve sought through our fight for the right to repair” because it appears to still support restrictions that require parts to be bought straight from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iNdlv"&gt;Apple says it plans to sell “more than 200 individual parts and tools.” The company will also offer repair manuals that customers can review before buying the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DVwdV"&gt;Pricing for the parts and tools hasn’t been announced. Apple says customers can receive a recycling credit for returning their used part after completing a repair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements don’t break Face ID in iOS 15.2 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11MpV1qW74-jkRK0vySgc-cvBw=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70152317/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqHPpW"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that it would be rolling out a software update to iPhone 13 devices to make it easier to replace their screens without breaking Face ID, but it didn’t specify when that update might arrive. Fortunately, we may not have to wait long, as repair experts say they have successfully completed the easier screen swaps on iPhone 13 handsets running the iOS 15.2 beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBnMV"&gt;Before the update, keeping Face ID working after swapping the screens also required moving over a microcontroller from the original phone to the new one. Doing so is a complex process, and having to do it for every iPhone 13 that needs a new screen could make things difficult for indie repair shops. (You can read all about the issue &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786274%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacement-face-id-ios-15-2-beta-fixes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But on an iPhone 13 loaded with the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9oFrfXq5o"&gt;still worked&lt;/a&gt; after a screen swap &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; without having to bring over the microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NreKtM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f9oFrfXq5o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTblbM"&gt;Although Face ID still works, the screen-swapped iPhone 13 does show an “Important Display Message” warning that the device can’t verify is the screen is a “genuine Apple part” — even though &lt;em&gt;iCorrect&lt;/em&gt; says the screen actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a genuine part. This isn’t entirely out of the norm for Apple, though, which shows similar warnings on some iPhones following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805744/apple-iphone-battery-replacements-ios-safety-statement-unauthorized"&gt;battery replacements&lt;/a&gt; from unauthorized repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xG67U"&gt;Apple didn’t reply when we asked if it could confirm that iOS 15.2 is the version that will allow for the easier screen replacements when it’s released publicly. But given that the less-intensive screen swaps appear to work on the beta, it seems likely they will work in the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s new QuietComfort 45 are seeing their first price drop</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hFDi1t"&gt;Some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now are Bose’s QuietComfort 45, and they’re selling at the lowest price we’ve seen yet. Just two months following their release, you can buy them for $279 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098FKXT8L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYqeoj9E2O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/2ryLqz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; as a part of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sales&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a solid $50 price drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haBgJ3"&gt;If comfort is key, these are some of the most cozy headphones to wear. Like previous QuietComfort models, these can fold up and be stowed in the included zip-up case. They offer up to 24 hours of battery life per charge — you can even enjoy three hours of usage with just 15 minutes of charging.&lt;/p&gt;

Oddly, Amazon increased the price for this model last week, but now readers can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=58&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=59&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe924a-908d-b765-2dc&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22523255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. When not in use, the TV displays customizable photos or art. But when you need to use it as a TV, it has handy features like Amazon’s Alexa built in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;You can also still buy these TVs for roughly the same prices at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Amazon, Best Buy is including a 30-day subscription to FuboTV Pro, if that dictates where you make your purchase. It's worth noting that while Amazon no longer offers a free six-month HBO Max subscription as it did earlier this month, there’s a possibility we could see a similar perk come back as Black Friday nears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFrYMb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gbIbTj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10819823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDfG83"&gt;Apple’s most affordable desktop computer, the 2020 Mac Mini, is currently the cheapest it’s ever been. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 256GB version for $600 instead of its typical $700 at checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; is also offering it for the same price until November 29th, though you need to be a member to get it there for that price. Note that Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB version for $750&lt;/a&gt; at checkout instead of $899. You can place an order at that price, but it’s on backorder currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua3p2o"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that Apple’s M1-equipped Mac Mini outperforms most other Intel-based Macs, thanks to the M1 chip and its efficiently cooled chassis. It also comes with Wi-Fi 6 support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="el3DDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JRECoU"&gt;Prefer a Chromebook over a desktop computer? We’ve got you. The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is often on sale, but today’s discounts on both the 2020 and 2021 models are some of the best we’ve seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAFikk"&gt;Right now, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt; for $529 instead of $699. It comes with 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Evo-certified 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor. Meanwhile, you can save more money without compromising on battery life or build quality by getting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; of that very same Chromebook. Typically $529, Best Buy is selling that one for $389. Though, it comes with just 4GB RAM, a slower 64GB eMMC SSD, and Intel’s 10th Gen Core i3 processor model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkS9HE"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin highly recommends both Acer Chromebook Spin 713 model, praising how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 version&lt;/a&gt; outperformed many others at the time of its release in terms of features, build quality, and performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;, they wrote, improves on its predecessor with Thunderbolt 4 support and Intel’s 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GSFkTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HReJCZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6JSQWF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Chris Welch, Amazon’s new Fire TV Stick 4K Max — while a mouthful of a name — is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s “best straightforward 4K streamer.”&lt;/a&gt; And good news, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MQZXN1X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for the first time. Instead of paying its usual $55 cost, you can buy the stick for $35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5rn0n"&gt;Amazon’s latest flagship streaming stick supports Wi-Fi 6 and offers noticeably improved performance compared to the Fire TV Stick 4K. Apps launch faster and navigation feels more fluid, while there’s also support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10 Plus, and Dolby Atmos. Meanwhile, the updated remote in the box comes with handy shortcuts to live TV programming and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wiFh00"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eveFAD"&gt;If you prefer wireless earbuds to over-ear headphones, but you still crave active noise cancellation, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/164914311936?mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;amp;siteid=0&amp;amp;campid=5338794975&amp;amp;customid=VergeDeals110921&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;mkevt=1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/11/9/22770263/apple-airpods-google-pixelbook-hisense-tv-macbook-air-deal-sale&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22534304__t_w__r_theverge.com/authors__d_" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay’&lt;/a&gt;s deal on a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t buds is tough to pass up. You can get them for $95 through Jabra’s digital storefront. Up until now, eBay was selling the pair for a discounted $100, meaning you can now save about $135 off the new cost. Jabra says that although these may have minor blemishes, they’ve been inspected and cleaned and include all original accessories. The pair also comes with a two-year warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PmJQyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Hvihc6"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other good deals we found:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lSDZjd"&gt;Apple’s AirTag Loop, which securely attaches the AirTag Bluetooth tracker to backpacks and other items, is selling for an Amazon all-time low. Typically $29, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932LZM6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the deep navy version for $21.96 instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4STNw7"&gt;Target is currently offering a “&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy 2, Get 1 Free Mix &amp;amp; Match”&lt;/a&gt; promotion on select video games, as well as movies, books, board games, puzzles, and activity kits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tboUjP"&gt;Target is also throwing in a $10 Target gift card when you buy a &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/qnmvE5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 Game &amp;amp; Grub choice Gift Card&lt;/a&gt;. This gift card can be used toward a purchase from Xbox, GrubHub, or from various food chains like Domino’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Dave &amp;amp; Buster’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="Cnu5o8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dptafz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney is giving its characters a license to brawl in this Apple-exclusive game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUD4t6pnre6XxT6gkRHEH4e0ihA=/97x0:1126x686/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70146013/chrome_ghGnbrfT8M.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6DgKL5"&gt;If you’ve dreamt of the day Disney would wake up and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22736493/smash-bros-ultimate-disney-micky-mouse-sora-woody"&gt;see the huge potential&lt;/a&gt; in creating its own take on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; fighting game... that day has not yet come. But Disney may have just taken a step toward that future with &lt;em&gt;Disney Melee Mania&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple Arcade exclusive coming this December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4yXOg"&gt;While we’ve only gotten the briefest glimpses from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697"&gt;the game’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; (below) and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/disney-melee-mania-coming-this-december-exclusively-on-apple-arcade/"&gt;Apple’s press release&lt;/a&gt; today, it actually does feature Disney and Pixar characters like Elsa, Moana, and Buzz Lightyear smacking each other around with their powers, laser beams, and one mean oar in search of a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j0OrHA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Head in the game? Disney and Pixar's holo-arena awaits in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyMeleeMania?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyMeleeMania&lt;/a&gt; ⭐️Coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleArcade?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppleArcade&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG"&gt;https://t.co/QF62cs1cRG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uwVMUCa7Vz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uwVMUCa7Vz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney Melee Mania (@playmeleemania) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playmeleemania/status/1460287296230813697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSY9cz"&gt;Here’s how Apple describes the 3v3 MOBA-esque game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pelAJW"&gt;Each champion will appear in a distinct action-ready design equipped with their own set of iconic moves and unlockable cosmetics. Throughout five-minute matches bursting with battle arena action, players will need to score the most points possible — or defeat the opposing team as many times as they can — for a chance at victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jdMwtU"&gt;Apple’s promising 12 characters to start, and more to come, presumably all included in your Apple Arcade subscription fee — $5 a month with no ads and no in-app purchases &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164414/apple-arcade-family-kids-crossy-road-butter-royale-loud-house-netflix"&gt;is Apple Arcade’s whole deal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUhzw"&gt;So far, we’ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="k4ybe6"&gt;Wreck It-Ralph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="466dUU"&gt;Moana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lHMTBj"&gt;Elsa (&lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NNn6Rt"&gt;Buzz Lightyear (&lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2k3o3e"&gt;Mickey Mouse (with his Sorcerer’s Apprentice costume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Md5j8b"&gt;Frozone (&lt;em&gt;The Incredibles&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t3ryDD"&gt;Bing Bong (&lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gUASo"&gt;Jasmine (&lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRIwlO"&gt;Timon (&lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xzxhsj"&gt;Maleficent (&lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4rrQqv"&gt;It’s from a studio called Mighty Bear Games, which brought &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/butter-royale/id1464623715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butter Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Apple Arcade last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter Blue’s Nuzzel-like top articles summary has arrived for iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U47MV3jDHzxQ6koU6x0q6tUQkqc=/0x0:4320x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145890/3_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Top_Articles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVYlHC"&gt;Twitter’s Top Articles feature, which creates a report of articles popular in Blue subscribers’ networks, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322"&gt;now available on iOS&lt;/a&gt; after the company promised last week that it’d be coming “very soon.” It’s been available on Android and the web, but now everyone who subscribes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;Twitter’s paid service&lt;/a&gt; should be able to see a roundup of what people were reading and tweeting about over the past day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o2l0q"&gt;Top Articles is a sort of spiritual successor to a service called Nuzzel, which provided a similar roundup through email. Nuzzel was run by a company called Scroll, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;was shut down when Twitter acquired the company&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Twitter said at the time it planned to bring Nuzzel back, and now its most popular feature is available to anyone who is willing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;pay the price for Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;. The premium service also gives users extra features like the ability to “undo” tweets or read ad-free articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2BJmp2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Available now on iOS — see what your network is sharing in the last 24 hours with Top Articles so you’ll always know what’s *really* going on. Check it out and add it to your Custom Navigation bar &lt;a href="https://t.co/NxLW8fTTPn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NxLW8fTTPn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1460291564895416322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZIJYK"&gt;While Twitter Blue subscribers who miss Nuzzel will likely be excited that Top Articles is now available on all the major platforms, it does feel like there should be a lite-version for those who don’t want to directly pay for Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De2bNi"&gt;While it makes sense that ad-free articles will incur a subscription cost, Twitter Blue as a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"&gt;creates the impression that Twitter is paywalling basic features&lt;/a&gt; that should be available to everyone, regardless of which tier of Twitter they’re using. In that vein, Threader (an app that makes Twitter threads more readable by formatting them as articles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threader/status/1460258719711694855?s=20"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it had been acquired by Twitter, and that it would be included in Twitter Blue. While this is likely good news for those with Blue, it being paywalled won’t help general Twitter users navigate threads any easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HNsPlf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon releases Prime Video app for Mac with downloads, AirPlay, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_MW0Sxkf8z-gbm8nPCZHmfrxbA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70145372/DSCF6095.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JkQ8Ir"&gt;Better late than never, as they say: Amazon today launched a Prime Video app for macOS that’s available as &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-prime-video/id545519333"&gt;a free download in the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Video for Mac includes support for offline downloads, and you can choose your preferred video quality both for regular streaming and downloads. (At the “best” setting, Amazon estimates around 5.8GB of data usage per hour when streaming. The figure is slightly lower for downloads, with Amazon quoting 2.9GB per hour of downloaded video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCaHFu"&gt;When you first open Prime Video for Mac, the app asks whether you want to receive notifications for content recommendations and other alerts. But from there, it’s much the same experience as on other platforms. Oddly, the Prime Video app itself can’t be made full-screen — but that changes as soon as you start playing a movie or TV show. Amazon is supporting native macOS features like picture-in-picture and AirPlay, and it’s also baked in its own extras like X-Ray with cast and behind-the-scenes info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5FNR"&gt;Aside from the regular free-with-Prime-subscription selection, there’s also a dedicated store tab where you can rent or purchase content. Amazon will use your account’s stored payment info when making charges. Other settings in the app include auto play and subtitle preferences, parental controls, and you can also view other devices that have been registered to your Prime account. Any deeper account management than that will require going to Amazon’s site in a browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93BTw0"&gt;From a functionality standpoint, most of what you’d want out of a Prime Video app is now on the Mac. That new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; makes for quite a portable movie-watching experience. Amazon’s Prime Video app for Mac is compatible with macOS Big Sur and later.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k1bPmC"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fEdsxM"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a built-in S Pen and a battery that can last two days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 2K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the perks of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is its 1.9-inch exterior screen for widgets and notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PoZM83"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="zK5t1W"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xa3xoR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A will receive three years of OS and security updates from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R9fmdS"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r9nZkH"&gt;Best Android phone under $500 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nicCXJ"&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists. It’s only available from Google’s online store because carriers don’t carry the Pixel 5A, but it’s worth the effort to get this hidden gem of a $450 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kYmA"&gt;The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67). Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="DFlWgw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Business Essentials subscriptions support small businesses that only use Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Business Essentials" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/214E4eCO0GHP-fXd2cfEyioGrgM=/0x33:1500x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141412/Apple_Apple_Business_Essentials_11102021_1500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Business Essentials | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epZ2WM"&gt;This week Apple unveiled another beta program, but instead of offering early previews of software for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, it’s a new initiative &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/business/essentials/"&gt;called Business Essentials&lt;/a&gt;. In line with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;recent shift toward selling services&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a subscription package aimed at small businesses with three different plans and a move that has been anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple"&gt;since it acquired the device management platform Fleetsmith&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOgfna"&gt;Starting at $2.99 per device per month, they can cover employees across a single device, more than one device, or a more expensive plan that covers multiple devices and adds more cloud storage. An AppleCare+ package will be available when it launches full in spring 2022, adding 24/7 phone support, access to training, and on-site repairs from Apple-trained technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cpUisD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OushE7mq0Ak?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgUa2W"&gt;Like many other device manage platforms, it streamlines the onboarding process, preinstalled apps, as well as management of security settings like FileVault for disk encryption and Activation Lock to secure devices if they’re lost or stolen. There’s also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212754"&gt;a new Business Essentials app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that puts all of the various settings in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSjMeu"&gt;I spoke to Vox Media senior VP of IT, Oumar Sall, who points out that it could be beneficial for startups during periods of high growth. Particularly while dealing with more remote workers, it can help get new employees up and running as quickly as possible even if a business doesn’t have the other parts of its network fully formed yet. It could also be helpful for schools if Apple’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/education/k12/it/"&gt;School Manager&lt;/a&gt; system isn’t a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bYN5BX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22444109/it-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk"},{"title":"How Apple’s enterprise app program became the new Wild West of mobile apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18232583/apple-ios-developer-enterprise-program-store-mobile-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H9JRyT"&gt;It also has the advantage of being available from Apple itself. However, it’s unlikely to challenge mainstays in the industry since, at least so far, it is limited by the number of employees supported, and it isn’t available across different platforms. There’s also the question of how exporting data works if a company wants to leave iCloud, endpoint security management, and the other issues that can crop up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nsP40"&gt;Jamf is one of those companies, as it provides device management to a number of organizations, including Vox Media. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468740-jamf-holding-corp-jamf-ceo-dean-hager-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;On an earnings call Friday&lt;/a&gt; after Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-introduces-apple-business-essentials/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Dean Hager said that he expects the service will help improve Apple’s built-in management tools that Jamf also relies on, without competing directly with many features Jamf provides. If Business Essentials helps kickstart adoption among small businesses or startups, it gives them a basis to buy even more Apple devices and services as they grow, even if they eventually move to more on-premises support or another provider altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly relying on states to pay for digital ID rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSYOHsRuYaylI_sE51MNxp6dFS0=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141339/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftM9p0"&gt;Apple will soon let users in participating states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;digitally store their driver’s licenses&lt;/a&gt; or state IDs on their iPhone’s wallet, but according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the initiative will be partially funded by the states — and their taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPDAbi"&gt;CNBC got ahold of contracts signed by Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, and found that Apple will maintain tight control over its deployment. It reports that Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program, including its device compatibility, the service’s launch date, states’ marketing campaigns, as well as how states report on the initiative's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qXNBn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1qbG0"&gt;The contract also says that each state will have to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple.” This includes testing out the service on different types of Apple devices “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AUXV"&gt;Additionally, states are responsible for promoting the digital ID service to citizens, as well as encouraging its adoption among members of the federal and state government, including local police and the Internal Revenue Service. State agencies are required to “feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” which is subject to Apple’s review and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNp0wG"&gt;And if that isn’t enough, Apple is holding states accountable for the authenticity of the program’s identity verification. The contract absolves Apple from any discrepancies in its verification system, stating: “Apple shall not be liable for any Verification Results, and Agency acknowledges that all Verification Results are provided ‘AS IS’ and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i54w6P"&gt;Despite being an Apple-led program, taxpayers are footing the bill to roll out this single-platform digital ID program in their states — even if they don’t have an iPhone. The contract clearly says “except as otherwise agreed upon between the Parties, neither Party shall owe the other Party any fees under this Agreement,” meaning that the participating states will be funding its promotion and adoption using taxpayer’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQQcCq"&gt;Having a digital ID program — especially one paid for by states — raises a number of concerns, the most obvious one being security. Users are expected to transfer their most sensitive documents to their iPhones, essentially establishing their identities on a single device. If implemented incorrectly, it sets a precedent for surveillance; what happens to user information when a digital ID is scanned at an airport or at an age-restricted concert? This type of tracking information is tempting to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDQ6WF"&gt;Much like what Apple is trying to do with its digital ID program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516653/clear-identity-health-covid-airports"&gt;Clear, a digital identification app&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a fast pass to the front of security lines in airports and sports stadiums, or as an app to store proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. As an article by &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Clear doesn’t rent or sell your information, as stated in its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clearme.com%2Fprivacy_policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F14%2F22781570%2Fapple-making-states-pay-digital-id-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, but it does say that Clear can use your non-biometric and non-health information to offer its users “products or services” that it thinks “may be of interest to them.” No matter how Apple chooses to leverage this data, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;digital ID system is making its way to Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, in addition to the four aforementioned states, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3sqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sDzj3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 15th, 3:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The post previously stated Clear uses data to promote relevant ads. According to Clear, the company “&lt;/em&gt;never rents or sells member information.” We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;
