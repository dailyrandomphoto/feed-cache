    <title>Apple’s long-in-the-works VR / AR headset may not launch until 2023</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1QRr9"&gt;Rumors have swirled for years about Apple releasing some kind of virtual reality / augmented reality headset. While reports had pegged a possible 2022 release for the company’s first mixed reality headset, the device is hitting some development snags and may not release until 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/apple-s-hotly-anticipated-headset-risks-being-delayed-until-2023?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHJRsu"&gt;Apple planned to reveal the headset at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, but “development challenges related to overheating, cameras and software have made it harder to stay on track,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. The issues mean the reveal may happen at the end of the year — or even later — with the headset going on sale in 2023. And Apple had apparently, at one point, planned to reveal the device even earlier; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports the company wanted to announce it in 2021 and ship it in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vb9Lo"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRU5Pg"&gt;This first headset is expected to be high end, with Apple considering prices above $2,000. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it will have two processors, and at least one will be “on par” with the new M1 Pro chip that’s available with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;refreshed MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22802981/apple-ar-headset-m1-processor-release-date-specs"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; that the device will have two chips with one being M1-adjacent. Previous reports have also said that the headset will have two 4K OLED microdisplays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, among other advanced components, all of which could be contributing to the rumored high price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpb5hc"&gt;Apple is also still working on a set of AR glasses, though they might be a long ways off. The company plans to introduce them “later this decade,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is technically back on iOS, thanks to a GeForce Now game streaming loophole</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtyUxf0pBtgDZv_BRibCrnvuzKs=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383281/GFN_Thursday_January_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlWmSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS today... sort of. The popular battle royale game isn’t back on the App Store (where it’s been missing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple pulled the app from its storefront&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020), but iPhone and iPad owners can now stream &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to play on their phones and tablets through Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, which opened up a closed beta today to test the new streaming version of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2L94w"&gt;Nvidia and Epic Games have been promising that Fortnite would come back to iOS through GeForce Now running through Safari’s web browser (the only way that Apple currently allows game streaming services like GeForce Now, Stadia, xCloud, or Luna to operate on iOS) &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;as far back as November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when the service first launched on Apple’s hardware. But it’s apparently taken quite a bit of time to sort out the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwgyeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fortnite streamed to iOS, complete with touchscreen optimized controls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMVD3h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has technically already been available on GeForce Now for Android users, but that version of the game is a streamed copy of the desktop version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The new version that Nvidia and Epic Games are beta testing is optimized for mobile devices, with similar touchscreen controls and menus to the old native iOS and Android versions of the game. (Nvidia warns that Android users who join the beta will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be able to play the new mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and won’t be able to use a keyboard and mouse like they currently can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1WrZP"&gt;According to Nvidia, beta sign-ups start today, with “selected members” set to get access later in January. The company says that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;beta will be a “limited time” process but that “we do not have an exact timeline for how long it will last.” Anyone interested in trying the new streamed version of Fortnite can sign up at Nvidia’s website, with both free and paid GeForce Now customers getting an “equal chance at the closed beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP7q7m"&gt;Nvidia is notably the only game streaming service that Epic Games is partnering with for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — as a deposition in the Apple / Epic trial revealed last year, Epic deliberately isn’t allowing Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;to offer &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as part of its xCloud service&lt;/a&gt;, due to concerns that xCloud would compete with Epic’s own PC offerings. Streaming &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through xCloud to iOS would also require that Epic pay Microsoft’s 30 percent fee for in-app purchases — similar in Epic’s eyes to the Apple fees that led to the company’s lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhPDK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OjhX3i"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, on the other hand, just acts as a conduit for Epic’s existing storefront, meaning that Epic Games won’t have to hand over a cent of any of the in-game purchases players make on the new streamed version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through GeForce Now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv6m2h"&gt;Epic and Nvidia aren’t saying how long the beta will last or when to expect the GeForce Now-streamed version of Fortnite to be broadly available for all Android and iOS users. And while game streaming has improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, it’s hard to imagine that the streamed version will be a better long-term solution than the native Fortnite app that used to be on the App Store. Still, for Fortnite fans looking to get a quick round in on the go, the GeForce Now option will probably be better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox finally supports M1 Macs natively with new beta  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv4a7Da6mIzYtDnjwZyi7U2b_F0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382333/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jy6cmn"&gt;Dropbox’s latest beta has added native support for Macs with M1 processors, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/dropbox-releases-long-awaited-macos-version-with-native-m1-support-in-beta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The addition was confirmed by a Dropbox community manager on the &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/td-p/527743"&gt;company’s forums&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve verified it by installing the latest beta of the macOS app. You can grab it yourselves from &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-desktop-client-builds/Beta-Build-140-3-1903/td-p/570154"&gt;this Dropbox forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59drqh"&gt;The service has always worked on Apple’s M1 Macs, but until now it’s had to use Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer. This allowed the macOS app, which was originally designed for old Intel-based Macs, to run on machines with Apple’s new M1 processors. Offering native M1 support should result in Dropbox having better performance and consuming less power when used with Apple Silicon devices. That said, Rosetta translation is so fast you might not notice a difference in day-to-day use (we haven’t so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BESiec"&gt;Dropbox was one of the last high-profile holdouts still lacking support for Apple’s ARM-based processors. In October there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751178/dropbox-native-apple-silicon-app-m1-2022"&gt;some controversy&lt;/a&gt; after forum posts from the company’s employees suggested more customers would have to ask for a native M1 version before the company would develop it. The outcry that followed prompted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO to publicly announce&lt;/a&gt; that an M1-optimized version of the company’s macOS app would arrive in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGG0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlzIUo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pr32We"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5mAZc705qkg0L06yKrgETfWWVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381863/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Apple App Store scammer AmpMe lowers prices and says it’ll investigate its ‘consultants’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6MVzgbMo5nkWbSiV6DRM2wf2HY=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381697/ampme-0616.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nTluDF"&gt;AmpMe &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;a brand-new app that popped up just to scam unsuspecting users out of their money. See the photo atop this post? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9391461/ampme-music-streaming-app-syncing"&gt;That’s from 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when we first covered the idea: an app that can sync up a room full of smartphones into a single gigantic speaker with no fees in sight. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626605370142724"&gt;as App Store scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou points out&lt;/a&gt;, the app looks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;seriously shady more than six years later — if you downloaded it yesterday, it would immediately try to sell you on a $9.99 a week automatic recurring subscription. That’s $520 a year, an incredible sum if you pull it out as a party trick and then forget to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ82b8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626647300669440"&gt;AppFigures estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app has raked in $13 million since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MDwU9J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3. Buy lots of fake reviews on a daily basis (notice the pattern of all these non-sensical reviewer “names”): &lt;a href="https://t.co/VtabR80QkP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VtabR80QkP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626639067238403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s775Xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;As we discussed last April&lt;/a&gt;, it’s ridiculously easy to find scams on Apple’s App Store — just follow the money and look at the reviews.  If you see an app that charges ridiculous subscription fees, yet still has loads of five-star ratings, something might be off. And if those reviews look absolutely fake, and the app’s barely functional, you’ve probably spotted a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvGrI4"&gt;What’s less easy to find: a company accused of scamming willing to stand up for itself.  Most are completely silent, but when we reached AmpMe for comment, we got a reply from its support email address. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="50KOyM"&gt;Hi Sean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lfWoj"&gt;The free version of our app is the most popular version and the vast majority of our users never paid a dime. Given its reception and popularity, AmpMe is a valued app and works as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axaFLr"&gt;To claim that our users are commonly paying $520 per year does not reflect reality. For example, in 2021, the average user that subscribed and took advantage of our free trial paid a total average of $17. If you take only paying users, the average yearly subscription revenue is about $75. Internally, this has reinforced our belief that AmpMe’s pricing is transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPeNZ"&gt;Regarding the reviews, we hear the feedback loud and clear. Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M21Dp"&gt;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met. We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsjEi"&gt;The AmpMe Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeJCu"&gt;We can’t confirm AmpMe’s numbers, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There are at least three other interesting takeaways in that reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8M9j9x"&gt;AmpMe isn’t denying that it hired someone to pump its brand in the App Store. Nor is it pledging not to do that in future. It’s simply pointing the blame somewhere else. Maybe it’s angry its consultants faked these reviews. Maybe it’s just annoyed they got caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S30gXi"&gt;AmpMe is lowering its price as a result of this scrutiny. In fact, the company’s update has already been approved and is live on the store. It’s $4.99 a week now, or $260 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NaPwWS"&gt;AmpMe isn’t dropping its subscription tactics, which the company believes is “transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="x461FP"&gt;I downloaded a copy of AmpMe, and I have to admit it’s not quite as blatant as I expected having heard the news. While it absolutely does hit you with a subscription request the moment you open the app, tempts you into a three-day free subscription, and the little “X” to bypass that screen is hard to spot, the app does at least clearly say how much it’s going to charge in big white letters right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX39v"&gt;And if you do hit the “X” and skip the subscription, the app seems functional — if only as a way to watch music videos from YouTube while you chat with randos or friends, as the sync-multiple-phones-as-speakers functionality is locked behind AmpMe’s paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOpOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Profiting off forgetfulness is common now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nK6Y0"&gt;So the fact that Apple isn’t pulling this one from the App Store (and instead appears to be helping AmpMe clean up the more obvious fake reviews, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t really surprise me. It’s not one of the worst offenders, and the state of the tech industry is that many, many companies profit from the “whoops, forgot to cancel my subscription” phenomenon, including Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfcrqX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;But as I suggested in September&lt;/a&gt;, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, the one that sells privacy as its brand and claims to put customers first, could do a heck of a lot more to show it. It could lead here instead of following. It could stop profiting from people’s forgetfulness, provide automatic refunds when people have been scammed, stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default, and kill off the star rating system that allows review fakes to flourish. Last October, it took one of those suggestions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;brought back a way to actually report App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;. We have more.&lt;/p&gt;

It isn’t the first company Eleftheriou has uncovered where a seemingly legitimate app that’s been around for years sprouts a new set of fake reviews, and a new screen advertising an exorbitant subscription price that you have to pay or dismiss the first time you launch. (Many of these screens even look largely the same.) I wouldn’t be surprised if there are companies going around shopping this exact service to old apps, in exchange for a cut of the revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/"&gt;It seems like it may not be the first time&lt;/a&gt; AmpMe’s CEO cashed in on an old app, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1V7JC"&gt;If you’ve been approached by such a company, or work for such a company, I’d love to talk to you. I’m at sean@theverge.com. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will clarify iCloud Private Relay error messages in iOS 15.3 to not blame cell carriers as much</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DF4-0WNQ2LGPIXLaHWqCZAcq8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380977/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoeElR"&gt;Apple is updating the wording for iCloud Private Relay issues in the latest iOS 15.3 beta, clarifying that problems with the service may be an inadvertently switched-off setting and not issues with a customer’s specific cell carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUZct6"&gt;The old message put the blame for iCloud Private Relay not working squarely on the shoulders of cell carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ULsaTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Your cellular plan doesn’t support ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay. With ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cQVN1J"&gt;Unsurprisingly, that wording &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;led to confusion earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; when customers couldn’t get iCloud Private Relay to work on cellular connections. The issue, at least according to T-Mobile, was actually on Apple’s end: it seems that the company’s recent iOS 15.2 update toggled off Private Relay for cellular data by accident, not that T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon had suddenly disabled the feature from working on their networks. The new wording makes things a little clearer that the issue might be an accidentally toggled setting elsewhere in iOS and not a cell company problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZAeNGD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImUhRW"&gt;Apple has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614"&gt;iCloud Private Relay support document&lt;/a&gt; today to make it clearer that customers might not be able to use the feature if they’ve turned off the “Limit IP Address Tracking” toggle for specific Wi-Fi or cellular networks, along with how to fix that problem on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fh2k9M"&gt;Hopefully, the new support document, clarified language from Apple, and the confirmations from all three major US carriers will be enough to put this week’s iCloud Private Relay confusion behind everyone. Given that the service is still technically in beta, though, it’s probably a good thing that Apple is sorting out the bugs now before it turns the service on by default. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple patches HomeKit denial-of-service bug with new iOS update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKIfW9xo6YGfBxgtaUb4cDK08us=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380017/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h7iO0"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple released the 15.2.1 version of iOS, a minor update to the mobile operating system that fixes bugs, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865145/apple-ios-vulnerability-homekit-devices-bug-crash"&gt;denial-of-service vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvcEXU"&gt;The 15.2.1 patch addresses a vulnerability triggered through HomeKit, the software API for connecting smart home devices to iOS applications. If the vulnerability was exploited, HomeKit devices labeled with a very long name would cause iPhones and iPads to endlessly freeze, crash, and reboot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTLX5z"&gt;Since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device would trigger the crash again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pec8D"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213043"&gt;security notification&lt;/a&gt; for the 15.2.1 update lists only one change, a fix for the HomeKit vulnerability. Details of the fix state that a “resource exhaustion issue was addressed with improved input validation,” presumably to prevent long HomeKit device names from being read into memory by iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQUHsu"&gt;Besides security updates, the patch also fixed a bug that impacted performance of third-party CarPlay apps and another that prevented the Messages app from loading certain photos sent via iCloud. Users can update iOS by opening the Settings app on a device and tapping “General,” then selecting “Software Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RE9TA"&gt;The HomeKit bug was discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas, who &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;published details on his blog&lt;/a&gt; on January 1st. At the time, Spiniolas accused Apple of being slow to respond to his initial disclosure, which was made in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTr7iW"&gt;According to Spiniolas’ blog, the bug affects iOS versions at least as far back as 14.7 and likely before, meaning these devices are still vulnerable. Owners of iPhones or iPads should update their devices as soon as possible to benefit from the new update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s largest iPad Pro with the M1 processor is $100 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3c1n-CLOaIRAs0MA4nf51TOTOH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378854/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger 12.9-inch iPad sports a Mini LED screen and more real estate for use with Apple’s Pencil.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mpzFb6"&gt;There is no better screen in the world of tablets (yet) than the Mini LED panel on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro of 2021. While Mini LED is not super common yet — though we did see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22871890/computer-monitors-ces-2022-lg-samsung-asus-alienware-oled-qd-mini-led-ark"&gt;more of it announced at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; — it’s appealing as it achieves deeper black levels, a high contrast ratio, and high brightness. It’s also more expensive than a traditional LCD panel, so any dollar saved can be a worthwhile one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcfaiz"&gt;If you want that Mini LED-equipped iPad Pro, we have a solid discount to share. Apple’s Wi-Fi-equipped base 128GB storage configuration is $100 off. This model usually runs for $1,099, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it in the silver colorway for $999. The 2021 iPad Pro also packs Apple’s stellar M1 processor, ensuring its performance can not only push all those pixels but do so with speed and with the promise of enough performance headroom to likely stay that way for years to come. If you prefer more storage, you can get the 256GB configuration for $1,099 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals011222" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (also $100 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VjMeBq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aYPmhE"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro wireless controller for Switch is an intriguing alternative to Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/24/14699044/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch Pro controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XXTW41G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the Fusion Pro in its slick white-and-black colorway for $65.99, a savings of $34 off its usual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjE22"&gt;The PowerA Fusion Pro may be worth considering if you want to try something that’s as close as you can get to a Switch-equivalent to the Xbox Elite controller. It has customizable analog sticks and optional rear paddle buttons. When it’s wired to your Switch dock, its 3.5mm headphone jack can pipe game audio to your headphones. It also lacks some things found in the Switch Pro controller, like rumble and Amiibo support. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22608203/powera-fusion-pro-customizable-analog-sticks-paddles-nintendo-switch-controller-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lt5ZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973226"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrvxhl"&gt;From a cute white controller to a cute white camera, the Wyze Cam v3 is an inexpensive home camera that supports 1080p recording with weather resistance for outdoor use. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095NWYQBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has it with kitted out with a spotlight LED for just $36.60, saving about $16 and making it an excellent option for monitoring a front door, like a mini flood light for a much cheaper price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq87FF"&gt;The Wyze Cam v3 also supports both color and black-and-white night vision, so its ability to see in the dark is quite good even when the spotlight is not in use. These little cameras are some of the most affordable ones around, offering solid video quality with motion detection, two-way audio, and support for both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mnpk7X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22879759/wyze-cam-plus-lite-pay-what-you-want-subscription-person-detection-cloud-recordings-12-seconds"},{"title":"Wyze’s cameras can now be a monitored home security system","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750594/wyze-cams-monitored-security-smart-switches-price-release-date-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hVbINL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10973234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAKO0S"&gt;While the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;CES 2022&lt;/a&gt; announcements featured new innovations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;coming to OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;, the promise of even better tech will ultimately bring us even more expensive OLEDs. As for the here and now, the 48-inch LG A1 OLED is $846.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saving $353 off MSRP. The A1 may not be the top tier in LG’s lineup, but if you don’t need a giant TV you can’t go wrong saving money on this affordable panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiTCRr"&gt;OLEDs are a great choice in general for deeper black levels and excellent contrast, but you don’t have to break the bank. We have featured the popular LG C1 OLED TVs numerous times, though today’s deal on its entry-level A1 counterpart gets us below $1,000 — not something you see every day for OLED. Unlike the C1, which features a 120Hz refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 ports, the A1 tops out at 60Hz and doesn’t support 4K at 120Hz. Still, it seems like a solid TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LyFvW0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10959416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tj92BW"&gt;More deals to deal with:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="L6SAZv"&gt;The Razer Nari Essential gaming headset is a bit long in the tooth, but if you don’t mind Micro-USB charging it seems like a fine wireless headset for just $41.99 ($58 off MSRP) at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals011222&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>How to mute a word or phrase on Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9L9qO_CtfLAzWvVWNfupkuPkNE=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378592/twitter.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;In February 2020,  I found that that it was possible not only to mute conversations or other accounts on Twitter, but (courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nonprofWHIT/status/1229964006330380289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1229964006330380289%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F19%2F21144097%2Ftwitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;a tweet by @nonprofWHIT&lt;/a&gt; ) that you could also mute a specific &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;. And you could do it straight from a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZRtti"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?s=20"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; it is expanding this feature so that when you mute a word or phrase, it will not appear in your Explore tab or Event-based notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CalAyd"&gt;Here’s how you go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPBAYz"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kiOUjU"&gt;If you’re using the Twitter app on an iPhone, it’s a quick and easy process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WDHN6T"&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="olIheA"&gt;Choose “Mute” from the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEzRpO"&gt;You’ll be sent to a page where you can choose from where you want to mute the word (your timeline or notifications), from whom (anyone or people you don’t follow), and the duration (forever, 24 hours, seven days, or 30 days). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the word you want to mute. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct4FjssBFbrPRlqSFHRIEaTYgSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731703/IMG_589D3687AA11_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select where you want to mute it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDH9hXswL9-N6bXW-V0tYJdiQvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731705/IMG_BB887E06D435_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select where you want to mute it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VevJJq"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QEISnd"&gt;If you’ve got an Android phone, don’t despair. You can also mute words from the Android Twitter app (or, for that matter, from the iOS Twitter app) through the app’s settings. It’s not quite as fast as doing it directly from a tweet, but it’s just as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dioGVM"&gt;Select your icon on the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86FxuH"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aUmPGy"&gt;Tap “Muted words.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWrdR2"&gt;Tap the plus sign and enter the word you want to mute. You then get the same choices as to where, from whom, and duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Android, you mute using settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTl99kR7ncdZUAn443VgaOsHAHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161869/Screenshot_20220111_164607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Android, you mute using settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enter each word or phrase separately." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4oiyYduCftQXYz_BYEYRnba7lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161872/Screenshot_20220111_164831.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter each word or phrase separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78Fb6s"&gt;If you no longer want to mute the word or you want to extend the mute time, return to the “Muted words” screen, tap on the word in question, and choose the corresponding option (“Delete word” or “Change mute time”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can always delete the muted word." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJM9RKxdhhrJusCZm98IBsSy0b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161887/Screenshot_20220111_164953.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can always delete the muted word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RO26hyhtA6H-OU6WSHsyeWV9GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161886/Screenshot_20220111_165009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yGqJr7"&gt;Mute words or phrases on your desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kIw7dK"&gt;And finally, if you’re tweeting directly from Twitter’s website, you can mute a word from there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mUDyjq"&gt;On your desktop, from the left-hand menu, click on “More” &amp;gt; “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlrwIF"&gt;In the right column, click on “Muted words.” Click on the plus sign in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0x5wni"&gt;Now you can enter the word or phrase you want to mute. As with the mobile Twitter apps, you can choose whether to mute from your timeline or notifications, from anyone or people you don’t follow, and for how long. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLiNAOQx6_OtIxogeghXdLHom1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161973/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_4.59.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BIzId"&gt;When you’ve made all your choices, click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rpSnz"&gt;If you want to unmute any words, go back to the “Muted words” column. Click on the red crossed-out volume symbol to the right of the word, and then click “Unmute” on the pop-up window that appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R66EzpN58QfNo7ElEtgaP5xvr2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161974/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_5.01.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7KYdrh"&gt;Some additional notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MIsPI2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options"&gt;Twitter has a number of ways&lt;/a&gt; you can mute different types of info in your timeline and notifications. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Tr9Tbt"&gt;You can also mute specific mentions of specific accounts (but not mute the account itself) by using the @ in front of the account name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRELIu"&gt;If you mute a word, you will also mute that word’s hashtag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="znDiJJ"&gt;Muting is not case-sensitive (“spoilers” and “SPOILERS” will both work), and you can use a phrase with punctuation (“Hey, you!”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdxx9i"&gt;Twitter is expanding the ability to mute words, phrases, etc. to areas other than timelines and notifications. Just yesterday, it announced that blocked or muted text would also no longer appear in Events-based areas:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="y91ggM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First up, Events. Now across Android, iOS, and web, Events from accounts you’ve blocked or muted won’t appear in your Explore tab, “What’s happening” sidebar and emails, or Event-based notifications.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56qsSQ"&gt;If / when the ability to mute is extended even further, we’ll add it to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3o5ip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 12th, 2022, 10:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on February 19th, 2020, and has been updated to allow for UI changes and new features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/apple-removes-wordle-apps-after-user-confusion-stokes-downloads"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, yes — many of them have been removed from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them on Tuesday, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many other apps like it on the App Store. (He later made his account public again to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880353/wordle-copycat-creator-apology-word-game-app-store-apple"&gt;issue a response about his app being pulled.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eXFsor"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYQOJeNtNEEZB_72WBwboMnXZj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162051/IMG_3661.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 5PM ET today, showing two clones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBxGL0BzrKpXmt9N2ro0h_yUC18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162334/IMG_3666.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 8:08PM ET — the first results are now an app from five years ago, and a story about Words With Friends 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdr2q4"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for confirmation that it was the one that took action against the Wordle-alikes, but it seems like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; was able to get confirmation that it did. By initiating a crackdown on the apps, the company has tipped the scales significantly to protect the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KGNEZ"&gt;While there have been similar high-profile situations in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/wordle-clone-ios-mobile-gaming"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;Threes vs 2048&lt;/a&gt; come to mind — it’s hard to think of a recent example where Apple stepped in as heavily as it seems to have done today. Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats"&gt;does have language about copycats in its developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s notably vague: “Come up with your own ideas,” section 4.1 reads. “Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ooG9T"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/"&gt;questions about how Apple would deal with blatant clones&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s seemingly let things slide in some instances. With disappearance of the Wordle-alikes from the App Store, we may have gotten a precedent for how similar is too similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcpVL0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 12th, 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation from &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;em&gt; that Apple removed the cloned apps, and information about one developer’s response to his app being pulled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
