										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lahaus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Haus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has developed an online real estate marketplace operating in Mexico and Colombia, has secured $100 million in additional funding, including $50 million in equity and $50 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital was obtained as an extension to the company’s Series B, the first tranche of which closed in January. With the latest infusion, Medellin, Colombia-based La Haus has now secured $135 million total for the round and over $158 million in funding since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Bay Area venture firms Acrew Capital and Renegade Partners co-led the round, which also included participation from Jeff Bezos’ Bezos Expeditions, Endeavor Catalyst, Moore Strategic Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Rappi’s Simon Borrero, Maluma, and Gabriel Gilinski. Existing backers who put money in this round include Greenspring Associates, Kaszek, NFX, Spencer Rascoff’s 75 &amp; Sunny Ventures, Hadi Partovi and NuBank’s David Velez. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerónimo Uribe (CEO), Rodrigo Sánchez-Ríos (president), Tomás Uribe (chief growth officer) and Santiago Garcia (CTO) founded the company after Jerónimo and Tomas met Sánchez-Ríos at Stanford University. Prior to La Haus they started and ran Jaguar Capital, a Colombian real estate development company with over $350 million of completed retail and residential projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company declined to reveal at what valuation the extension was raised, with Sánchez-Ríos saying only that it was “a significant increase” from January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B extension follows impressive growth for the startup, which saw the number of transactions conducted on its Mexico portal climb by nearly 10x in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the 2020 second quarter. With over 500 homes selling on its platform (via lahaus.com and lahaus.mx) the company is “the market leader in selling new housing in Spanish-speaking Latam by an order of magnitude,” its execs claim.  La Haus expects to have facilitated more than $1 billion in annualized gross sales by the end of the year. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Like the US, a two-tier venture capital market is emerging in Latin America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/embed/#?secret=6FPRPBvpGC" data-secret="6FPRPBvpGC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded with the mission of making it easier for people to buy homes and helping “solve LatAm’s extreme housing inequality.” Its end goal is to accelerate access to new housing by both generating and curating supply and demand and then matching it with its technology, noted Sánchez-Ríos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last six months, our chief product officer has built a product that allows this to happen 100% digitally,” he said. “Before it would take a lot of time, people involved and visits. We want to provide people looking for a home a similar experience as to people looking for their next flight at delta.com.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has done that by embedding its software to developers’ new projects so that it can bring that digital experience to its users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are able to view the projects on our sites, we match them and then they can see in real time which units of a particular tower are available, and then select, sign and pay for everything digitally,” Sánchez-Río said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183459" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183459" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183459 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?resize=300,279 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?resize=768,714 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?resize=680,632 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mkup2-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183459" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: La Haus</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for new housing in the region and other emerging markets in general is acute, they believe. And the pace of building new homes is slow because small and mid-sized developers – who are responsible for building the majority of new homes in Latin America – are cash constrained. At the same time, mortgages are mostly not affordable for consumers, with banks extending only a fraction of the credit to individuals compared to the U.S., and often at far worse terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What La Haus is planning to do with its new capital – particularly the debt portion – is go beyond selling homes via its marketplace to helping extend financing to both developers and potential buyers.It plans to take the proprietary data it has been able to glean from the thousands of real estate transactions conducted on it platform to extend capital to developers and consumers “more quickly, with much lower risk and at better terms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, what the startup has accomplished is notable. Being able to purchase a home 100% digitally is not that easy even in the U.S. Pulling that off in Latin America – which has historically trailed behind in digital adoption – is no easy feat. By year’s end, La Haus intends to be in every major metropolitan area in Mexico and Colombia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its ultimate goal is to be able to help new, sustainable homes “to be built faster, alleviating the inequality caused by lack of access to inventory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Acrew Capital’s Lauren Kolodny, La Haus is building a solution specific to the issues of Latin America’s housing market, rather than importing business models – such as iBuying – from the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For many people in the United States home equity is their largest asset. In Latin America, however, consumers have been challenged with an impenetrable real estate market stacked against consumers,” she wrote via email. “La Haus is removing barriers to home ownership that stifles millions of people from achieving financial security. Specifically, Latin America has no centralized MLS, very costly interest rates, no transactional transparency, and few online informational tools.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Haus, Kolodny added, is breaking down these barriers by consolidating listings online, offering pricing transparency and educating consumers about their financing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acrew first invested in the startup in its $10 million Series A and has been impressed with its growth over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have a unique focus on new housing &#8212; a massive industry worldwide, but especially in emerging markets where new housing is so necessary,” Kolodny said. “The management team&#8230;knows real estate in Latin America better than anyone we&#8217;ve met.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, the La Haus team is excited to put its new capital to work. As</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sánchez-Río put it, “$50 million goes a lot further in Mexico and Colombia than in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are going to be very aggressive in Mexico and Colombia, and plan to go from four to at least 12 markets by the end of the year,” Jeronimo told TechCrunch. “We’re also excited to roll out our financing solution to developers and buyers.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html?src=rss" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">booming business</a> is dominated by digital ads, but it also has hardware ambitions beyond VR. During the company&#8217;s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said its next product release would be a pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things,&#8221; the Facebook co-founder said. &#8220;So I&#8217;m excited to get those into people&#8217;s hands and to continue to make progress on the journey toward full augmented reality glasses in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s sunglasses have been the subject of rumors since 2019. Back then, sources told <em>CNBC </em>that Facebook was working with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-orion-ar-glasses.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">AR eyewear nicknamed &#8220;Orion.&#8221;</a> The glasses were billed as a full-fledged phone replacement on which you could take calls, see information and even broadcast livestreams. That inevitably drew comparisons to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-google-glass-enterprise-edition-2.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Google Glass</a> (another Luxottica collab) instead of the phone-tethered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-13-snap-spectacles-3.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Spectacles</a> from Snap. Last year, Hugo Barra, then VP VR at Facebook Reality Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">confirmed</a> that the glasses would land in 2021. But, we haven&#8217;t heard much since.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Facebook, the glasses hold the key to its future. Alongside virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) is integral to building the &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. In the future, Facebook will morph into a shared, liveable platform that lets you &#8220;teleport&#8221; between different social experiences using VR and AR, Zuckerberg explained.</p>
<p>The term metaverse is the latest buzzword seized upon by Silicon Valley and futurists. While the concept has been around for well over a decade, it gained traction after the breakout success of multiplayer game creation platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-09-fornite-playground-cash-cow-minecraft.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-sony-in-game-music-153541190.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Roblox</em></a>. Earlier this week, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella mentioned an &#8220;enterprise metaverse&#8221; on his company&#8217;s earnings call.</p>
<p>For Facebook, the metaverse is more than just a fad. The company is spending billions in order to build its shared universe, which will be populated with Facebook users and digital ads, according to Zuckerberg. In order for it to become a reality, the company needs more people to buy its computing hardware. Therefore, the plan is to make those devices more affordable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business model isn&#8217;t going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible,&#8221; Zuckerberg noted. &#8220;So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. So that&#8217;s kind of at a high level how I&#8217;m thinking about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunglasses aren&#8217;t the only hardware Facebook is reportedly working on. Multiple reports have claimed Facebook is developing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-watch-rumor-222419888.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">smartwatch</a> with a built-in cellular connection and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">detachable display</a>. Initially, it was believed that the watch would be first out the gate, but it seems Zuckerberg had other plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industrial robotics are big and heavy — and in some cases, legitimately dangerous. They’re also extremely difficult to train — particularly if you plan to implement them for tasks outside of their purpose-built intentions.</p>
<p>There’s huge opportunity for the right AI/software company to come along and help make the bulky systems intended for things like auto manufacturing easier to program and more versatile. Honestly, there’s probably enough room to support multiple companies in the category as robots become an increasingly essential part of how we do business.</p>
<p>This week we saw a pair of big news stories from companies operating in that space. On Tuesday, Covariant announced an $80 million raise — a quick follow-up to the $40 million Series B it announced in May 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2183276" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183276" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2183276" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg 6430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_07_13_covarient_founders-005.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183276" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Covariant</p></div></p>
<p>I spoke to president, chief scientist and co-founder (and recurring TC Sessions: Robotics guest) Pieter Abbeel for the piece, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/robotic-ai-firm-covariant-raises-another-80-million/">you can check out here</a>. I further picked the long-time UC Berkeley professor’s brain about some broader robotics trends.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve seen a marked increase in investment activity around robotics and automation since the beginning of the pandemic. Do you anticipate that this interest will maintain?</strong></p>
<p>It won’t just maintain. It’ll continue to accelerate on a dramatic scale. The demand isn’t new but the pandemic has certainly increased demand for resilient and robust robotics. COVID-19 accelerated a timeline that was already in motion. Other factors that contribute to the momentum include the rise of e-commerce replacing in-store purchases along with Amazon’s strive for efficiency. They’ve raised consumer expectations of fast delivery across the board and making good on that promise often starts with warehouse automation.</p>
<p><strong>As someone with experience in both an educational setting and a startup, how have universities’ approach to incubating companies evolved. What more can and should be done to foster entrepreneurship?</strong></p>
<p>With AI the transition from research to practice has been exceptionally fast. An idea could be published today, and many companies might be implementing it into their systems the next day. This trend has made AI researchers uniquely positioned to build new applications (compare this to, let&#8217;s say, Airbnb, Uber, food delivery companies, etc., which were not enabled by research advances, but by everyone having a smartphone, enabling a new model of doing business).</p>
<p>Structurally, one clear change at many universities is the introduction of artificial intelligence across many programs. A great example is &#8220;The Business of AI&#8221; course, which I co-teach in the Haas Business School at Berkeley, and which gives business students a solid understanding of the role of AI today, as well as trends and what the future might bring.</p>
<p>To foster more entrepreneurship in the U.S., leadership should consider how many international students are also the leading AI researchers. A faster visa/green card process for entrepreneurs would have a very high impact.</p>
<p><strong>Do you foresee continuing to teach, as Covariant grown?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I see a very strong synergy between being at the forefront of academic AI research at Berkeley and being at the forefront of industrial R&amp;D bringing AI Robotics into the real world as chief scientist at Covariant. The culture our CEO Peter Chen has fostered at Covariant also has great alignment with this; curiosity and lifelong learning are core values at Covariant.</p>
<p><strong>How actively does your team consider biases in its AI work?</strong></p>
<p>Bias in AI systems is of course a broader industry issue and is on the minds of our team members. As of today, bias in AI systems doesn&#8217;t directly play a role in our current robotic warehousing efforts. However, quality assurance more generally is core to everything we do, and quality assurance isn’t a one-axis thing, we have to consider quality and coverage of various data sources and performance across SKUs, warehouses, customers, etc. In that sense, there are actually many technical parallels.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like most of the activity on the industrial robotics front is happening on the software/AI side. Are robotics manufacturers continuing to evolve their hardware as software improves?</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, while we largely focus on the software/AI ourselves, we work with amazing partners to deliver fully functioning robotic systems. In doing so, we see continual improvement on the hardware as well. Most visible over a short time period are continual changes in end-of-arm tooling. In addition, we see interesting multiyear roadmap ideas in robotic arm form factors that take more R&amp;D and design effort to bring to market.</p>

<p>The other big news of the week is the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/"> unveiling of Intrinsic</a>, Alphabet’s most recent robotics play. Or, I guess I should say, most recently announced robotics play. The Alphabet X spinout has apparently been in the works for about five years now. It follows a fairly uneven robotics track record for Alphabet/Google that involved brief ownership of Boston Dynamics. But the company’s offering seems much more in-line with what Google excels at.</p>
<p>Here’s Intrinsic CEO, Wendy Tan-White, who most recently served as Alphabet’s VP of Moonshots:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation and force control.</p></blockquote>

<p>Closing the week’s roundup with a pair of athletic ‘bots. First is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/cassie-the-bipedal-robot-runs-a-5k/">the return of Cassie</a>, Oregon State University’s bipedal robot. Cassie took a bit of a backseat to OSU spinoff Agility’s delivery robot, Digit, but the school is continuing to do interesting things with the platform. A team of research helped teach the robot to run, using a a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.</p>
<p>In fact, Cassie managed to run a 5K in 53 minutes. Not great by human standards, but extremely solid for a robot using a single battery, particularly when you factor in the 6.5 minutes of troubleshooting an overheated computer and a poorly maneuvered turn.</p>
<p>Outside Olympians and T-shirt vendors, Toyota may well have been the most disappointed about the initial decision to delay the summer Olympics. The automotive giant clearly envisioned the Tokyo games as an ideal opportunity to showcase its technology for the world.</p>
<p>Now that the games are on, the company’s basketball robot <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/27/tokyo-olympics-robot/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">CUE is back in a big way</a>. After debuting in 2018, CUE returned to sink three-pointers during half-time at the USA-France game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Air taxis may still be pie in the sky, but there&#8217;s more than one way to move the air travel industry forward. <a href="https://www.craft.aero/">Craft Aerospace</a> aims to do so with a totally new vertical-takeoff and landing aircraft that it believes could make city-to-city hops simpler, faster, cheaper, and greener.</p>
<p>The aircraft — which to be clear is still in small scale prototype form — uses a new VTOL technique that redirects the flow of air from its engines using flaps rather than turning them (like the well-known, infamously unstable Osprey), making for a much more robust and controllable experience.</p>
<p>Co-founder James Dorris believes that this fast, stable VTOL craft is the key that unlocks a new kind of local air travel, eschewing major airports for minor ones or even heliports. Anyone that&#8217;s ever had to take a flight that lasts under an hour knows that three times longer is spent in security lines, gate walks, and of course in getting to and from these necessarily distant major airports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about flying wealthy people to the mall — there are major inefficiencies in major corridors,&#8221; Dorris told TechCrunch. &#8220;The key to shortening that delay is picking people up in cities, and dropping them off in cities. So for these short hops we need to combine the advantages of fixed wing aircraft and VTOL.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technique they arrived at is what&#8217;s called a &#8220;blown wing&#8221; or &#8220;deflected slipstream.&#8221; It looks a bit like something you&#8217;d see on the cover of a vintage science fiction rag, but the unusual geometry and numerous rotors serve a purpose.</p>
<p>The basic principle of a blown wing has been explored before now but never done on a production aircraft. You simply place a set of (obviously extremely robust) flaps directly behind the thrust, where they can be tilted down and into the exhaust stream, directing the airflow downwards. This causes the craft to rise upwards and forwards, and as it gets enough altitude it can retract the flaps, letting the engines operate normally and driving the craft forwards to produce ordinary lift.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183594" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183594" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183594 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?w=568" alt="" width="568" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png 1481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=251,300 251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=768,919 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=568,680 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=1283,1536 1283w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-08.png?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2183594" class="wp-caption-text">During takeoff, thrust is redirected downwards by extending flaps.</p></div></p>
<p>The many rotors are there for redundancy and so that the thrust can be minutely adjusted on each of the four &#8220;half-wiings.&#8221; The shape, called a box wing, is also something that has been tried in limited fashion (there are drones with it, for example) but ultimately never proved a valid alternative to a traditional swept wing. But Dorris and Craft believe it has powerful advantages in this case, allowing for a much more stable, adjustable takeoff and landing than the two-engine Osprey. (Or indeed many proposed or prototype tilt-rotor aircraft out there.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183595" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183595" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183595 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?w=568" alt="" width="568" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png 1481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=251,300 251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=768,919 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=568,680 568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=1284,1536 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lift_Cruise-09.png?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2183595" class="wp-caption-text">During flight, the flaps retract and thrust pushes the plane forward as normal.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our tech is a combination of both existing and novel tech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The box wing has been built and flown; the high flap aircraft has been built and flown. They&#8217;ve never been synthesized like this in a VTOL aircraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, to be clear, the company has demonstrated a limited scale model that shows the principle is sound — they&#8217;re not claiming there&#8217;s a full-scale craft ready to go. That&#8217;s years down the line, but willing partners will help them move forward.</p>
<p>The fifth generation prototype (perhaps the size of a coffee table) hovers using to the blown wing principle, and the sixth, due to fly in a few months, will introduce the transitioning flaps. (I was shown a video of the prototype doing tethered indoor hovering but the company is not releasing this test footage publicly.)</p>
<p>The design of the final craft is still in flux — it&#8217;s not known exactly how many rotors it will have, for instance — but the basic size, shape, and capabilities are already penned in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll carry 9 passengers and a pilot, and fly around 35,000 feet or so at approximately 300 knots, or 345 mph. That&#8217;s slower than a normal passenger jet, but whatever time you lose in the air ought to be more than regained by skipping the airport. The range of the cleaner hybrid gas-electric engines should be around 1,000 miles, which gives a good amount of flexibility and safety margins. It also covers 45 of the top 50 busiest routes in the world, things like LA to SF, Seoul to Jeju Island, and Tokyo to Osaka.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183597" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183597" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2183597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFLanding.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2183597" class="wp-caption-text">It probably wouldn&#8217;t be flying at this altitude.</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, however, Dorris wants to make it clear that the idea is not &#8220;LAX to SFO&#8221; but &#8220;Hollywood to North Beach.&#8221; VTOL aircraft aren&#8217;t just for show: regulations permitting, they can touch down in a much smaller location, though exactly what kind of landing pad and micro-airport is envisioned is, like the aircraft itself, still being worked out.</p>
<p>The team, which has just worked its way through Y Combinator&#8217;s summer 2021 cohort, is experienced in building sophisticated transport: Dorris was a primary on Virgin Hyperloop&#8217;s propulsion system, and his co-founder Axel Radermacher helped build Karma Automotive&#8217;s drivetrain. It may not have escaped you that neither of those companies makes aircraft, but Dorris thinks of that as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen what&#8217;s come out of traditional aerospace over the last 10, 20 years,&#8221; he said, letting the obvious implication speak for itself that the likes of Boeing and Airbus aren&#8217;t exactly reinventing the wheel. And companies that partnered with automotive giants hit walls because there&#8217;s a mismatch between the scales — a couple hundred aircraft is very different from half a million Chevy sedans.</p>

<p>So Craft is relying on partners who have looked to shake things up in aerospace. Among its advisors are Bryan Berthy (once Director of Engineering at Lockheed Martin), Nikhil Goel (one of Uber Elevate&#8217;s co-founders), and Brogan BamBrogan (early SpaceX employee and Hyperloop faithful).</p>
<p>The company also just announced a letter of intent from JSX, a small airline serving low-friction flights on local routes, to purchase 200 aircraft and the option for 400 more if wanted. Dorris believes that with their position and growth curve they could make a perfect early partner when the aircraft is ready, probably around 2025 with flights beginning in 2026.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a risky, weird play with a huge potential payoff, and Craft thinks that their approach, as unusual as it seems today, is just plainly a better way to fly a couple hundred miles. Positive noises from the industry, and from investors, seem to back that feeling up. The company has received early stage investment (of an unspecified total) from Giant Ventures, Countdown Capital, Soma Capital, and its advisor Nikhil Goel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve demonstrated it, and we&#8217;re getting an enormous amount of traction from aerospace people who have seen hundreds of concepts,&#8221; said Dorris. &#8220;We&#8217;re a team of only 7, about to be 9 people&#8230; Frankly, we&#8217;re extremely pleased with the level of interest we&#8217;re getting.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">plan to morph itself into a &#8220;super app&#8221;</a> have been given a go for launch. According to PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, speaking to investors during this week&#8217;s second-quarter earnings, the initial version of PayPal&#8217;s new consumer digital wallet app is now &#8220;code complete&#8221; and the company is preparing to slowly ramp up. Over the next several months, PayPal expects to be fully ramped in the U.S., with new payment services, financial services, commerce and shopping tools arriving every quarter.</p>
<p>The company has spoken for some time about its &#8220;super app&#8221; ambitions &#8212; a shift in product direction that would make PayPal a U.S.-based version of something like China&#8217;s WeChat or Alipay or India&#8217;s Paytm. Similar to these apps, PayPal aims to offer a host of consumer services under one roof, beyond just mobile payments.</p>
<p>In previous quarters, PayPal said these new features may include things like enhanced direct deposit, check cashing, budgeting tools, bill pay, crypto support, subscription management, and buy now/pay later functionality. It also said it would integrate commerce, thanks to the mobile shopping tools acquired by way of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">$4 billion Honey acquisition</a> from 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, PayPal has continued to run <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/explore">Honey</a> as a standalone application, website and browser extension, but the super app could incorporate more of its deal-finding functions, price tracking features, and other benefits.</p>

<p>On Wednesday&#8217;s earnings call, Schulman revealed the super app would include a few other features as well, including high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, and messaging functionality outside of peer-to-peer payments &#8212; meaning you could chat with family and friends directly through the app&#8217;s user interface.</p>
<p>PayPal hadn&#8217;t yet announced its plans to include a messaging component until now, but the feature makes sense in terms of how people often combine chat and peer-to-peer payments today. For example, someone may want to make a personal request for the funds instead of just sending an automated request through an app. Or, after receiving payment, a user may want to respond with a &#8220;thank you,&#8221; or other acknowledgement. Currently, these conversations take place outside of the payment app itself on platforms like iMessage. Now, that could change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that&#8217;s going to drive a lot of engagement on the platform,&#8221; said Schulman. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to leave the platform to message back and forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the increased user engagement, the company expects to see a related bump in average revenue per active account.</p>

<p>Schulman also hinted at &#8220;additional crypto capabilities,&#8221; which were not detailed. However, PayPal earlier this month <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-07-15-Increased-Purchase-Limits-for-Crypto-on-PayPal">increased the crypto purchase limit</a> from $20,000 to $100,000 for eligible PayPal customers in the U.S., with no annual purchase limit. The company also this year made it possible for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">consumers to check out at millions of online businesses</a> using their cryptocurrencies, by first converting the crypto to cash then settling with the merchant in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Though the app&#8217;s code is now complete, Schulman said the plan is to continue to iterate on the product experience, noting that the initial version will not be &#8220;the be-all and end-all.&#8221; Instead, the app will see steady releases and new functionality on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>However, he did say that early on, the new features would include the high-yield savings, improved bill pay with a better user experience and more billers and aggregators, as well as early access to direct deposit, budgeting tools, and the new two-way messaging feature.</p>
<p>To integrate all the new features into the super app, PayPal will undergo a major overhaul of its user interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, the [user experience] is being redesigned,&#8221; Schulman noted. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got rewards and shopping. We&#8217;ve got a whole giving hub around crowdsourcing, giving to charities. And then, obviously, Buy Now, Pay Later will be fully integrated into it&#8230;The last time I counted, it was like 25 new capabilities that we&#8217;re going to put into the super app,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The digital wallet app will also be personalized to the end user, so no two apps are the same. This will be done using both A.I. and machine learning capabilities to  &#8220;enhance each customer&#8217;s experiences and opportunities,&#8221; said Schulman.</p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/paypal-pypl-earnings-q2-2021.html">delivered</a> an earnings beat in the second quarter with $6.24 billion in revenue, versus the $6.27 billion Wall St. expected, and earnings per share of $1.15 versus the $1.12 expected. Total payment volume from merchant customers also jumped 40% to $311 billion, while analysts had projected $295.2 billion. But the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/paypal-stock-paypal-earnings-q22021/">stock slipped</a> due to a lowered <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-stock-slips-as-earnings-beat-expectations-but-outlook-comes-up-short-11627504087">outlook for Q3</a>, impacted by eBay&#8217;s transition to its own managed payments service.</p>
<p>In addition, PayPal gained 11.4 million net new active accounts in the quarter, to reach 403 million total active accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trevor Milton, the fast-talking showman founder of Nikola and the electric truck startup&#8217;s former CEO and executive chairman, has been charged with three counts of fraud.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Milton &#8220;</span>engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive retail investors&#8221; for his own personal benefit, according to the federal indictment unsealed by U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Manhattan on Thursday. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and wire fraud by a federal grand jury.</p>
<p>Specifically, prosecutors detailed in the complaint how Milton used social media and frequent appearances on television in a PR blitz that flooded &#8220;the market with false and misleading information about Nikola&#8221; before the company even produced a product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The charges reflect a fast and furious run for Nikola and Milton, who founded the company in 2015. Milton received more attention after unveiling the first prototype and boasted that the company would produce &#8220;the iPhone of trucking.&#8221; Promises around other products including an electric pickup truck called Badger would soon follow as well as plans to build a factory in Arizona.</p>
<p>In March 2020, the company announced it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. Milton frequently posted on Twitter directing his message to retail investors after the company went public that summer. Then in September and just days after GM had announced a $2 billion investment in the company, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Nikola of fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">opened an inquiry</a> in the matter and within two weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">Milton had stepped down</a> as executive chairman.</p>
<p>Nikola issued a statement Thursday that distances itself from Milton, who is still its largest shareholder.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trevor Milton resigned from Nikola on September 20, 2020 and has not been involved in the company’s operations or communications since that time. Today’s government actions are against Mr. Milton individually, and not against the company. <span class="m_5855769363247723133apple-converted-space"> </span>Nikola has cooperated with the government throughout the course of its inquiry. We remain committed to our previously announced milestones and timelines and are focused on delivering Nikola Tre battery-electric trucks later this year from the company’s manufacturing facilities.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Talkiatry raised a $20 million Series A to scale a strategy simple in theory yet potentially challenging in execution: bring psychiatry services in-network with insurance providers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://talkiatry.com/">Talkiatry</a> announced today that it has raised a $20 million Series A to scale a strategy simple in theory yet potentially challenging in execution: bring psychiatry services in-network with insurance providers. The round, led by Left Lane Capital with participation from the founder and former CEO of CityMD, Dr. Richard Park, is an extension of Talkiatry’s previously secured $5 million financing. That check was led by Sikwoo Capital Partners with participation from Relevance Ventures and Park.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Robert Krayn and Dr. Georgia Gaveras, Talkiatry is a digital health startup that helps consumers access in-network appointments with psychiatrists for therapy and medicine management. The company employs an ongoing care model in which it takes a consumer in through a virtual survey, matches them with a psychiatrist based on their needs, and then follows the consumer through the care process from diagnosing symptoms to the actual prescription of medicine.</p>
<p>The startup’s true innovation lies in its plan to make psychiatric services covered by insurance providers for consumers. Many plans today don’t cover mental health services beyond a certain point &#8212; and at the same time, many high-quality psychiatrists don’t participate in private insurance plans because of minimal reimbursement and paperwork nightmares. As a result, the psychiatrists that are in-network may be consumed with patients, and the ones at private practices could have a price of up to $300 per session.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s many people who have identified the problem that [psychiatrists are not accessible],” said Krayn. “What the issue comes to next is are they really, really solving the problem, or are they working around it?”</p>
<p>Krayn explained how startups have turned to hiring therapists and nurse practitioners as replacements for psychiatrists, which he thinks decreases the clinical quality of care (the difference between a therapist and psychiatrist is that the latter can prescribe medication). He said his competitors have also focused more on lessening the out-of-pocket costs instead of avoiding them altogether.</p>
<p>“While that does increase access to mental health, we think that that necessarily doesn&#8217;t give the most amount of access to solve a real problem, which is that psychiatrists are not accessible,” he said.</p>
<p>Talkiatry has partnered <a href="https://talkiatry.com/insurance/">with a number of insurance providers</a> including United Healthcare, Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield and more. While companies like Cerebral, Headway and Uplit have similarly gone in-network, the co-founder argues that it has the least restrictive relationship with providers, meaning that consumers won’t have to pay out of pocket for anything outside of the typical copay.</p>
<p>“Sure, some platforms are offered as an added benefit in addition to a health insurance plan, but may have additional restrictions, i.e., a patient may get access to the platform but still pay a monthly fee to get service. Others may only be allowed a certain number of visits and some may only be available if your employer decides to offer it in addition,” he said. “Talkiatry has none of these restrictions and can be used like any other in-network doctor you typically go to.”</p>
<p>Stability among its supply of psychiatrists is key here. Talkiatry has hired psychiatrists as W-2 employees instead of contractors. By not using a contractor model, Talkiatry will have more stability in its services but could struggle with scale. The startup will rapidly and consistently hire psychiatrists with varying backgrounds to serve consumers. Plus, in order to expand into new markets, Talkiatry has to go through the arduous legal process of local licensing requirements, instead of just going to a white-label solution that helps staff similar companies while offloading individual practitioner certification.</p>
<p>While Ginger, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/on-demand-mental-health-service-provider-ginger-raises-50-million/">well-capitalized growth stage company</a>, and Lyra Health, <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/mental-health-startup-lyra-health-now-worth-4-6b-latest-megaround#:~:text=Mental%20health%20startup%20Lyra%20Health%20now%20worth%20%244.6B%20with%20latest%20megaround,-by%20Heather%20Landi&amp;text=High%2Dflying%20startup%20Lyra%20Health,raised%20%24680%20million%20to%20date.">a digital health unicorn last valued at $4.6 billion</a>, have recently made waves in the behavioral health space, Talkiatry is confident that it can break into the sector, which continues to attract <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/healthcare-trends-q1-2021/">record amounts of venture </a>capital from investors.</p>
<p>Its competition is paying attention. For example, Ginger has made more efforts to bring in-network mental health solutions to users, recently partnering with AmeriHealth Caritas District of Columbia and Cigna.</p>
<p>“Providing psychiatry in-network is one avenue to ensure people receive care, but it still does not solve the supply-demand imbalance in the mental healthcare space,” said Russell Glass, Ginger CEO and co-founder. He explained how Ginger’s product being on-demand and virtual helps it address the growing shortage of mental health providers, which will be a hurdle that Talkiatry will need to address, too.</p>
<p>Currently, Talkiatry has 44 clinicians on its platform, with 33 as psychiatrists and the remaining as nurse practitioners. It has done 30,000 visits since its launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Developer marketing came up in our conversation with strategic marketing firm MKT1, so we called on content marketing production company Draft.dev's CEO Karl Hughes to learn more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developers can be a tough crowd. They typically hate being marketed to and are often short on time, which sets a particularly high bar for any content marketing aimed at them.</p>
<p>Coming up with relevant content that developers find interesting takes specific know-how, and this is where <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a> comes in. Its Chicago-based founder and CEO <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/">Karl Hughes</a> describes the firm as &#8220;a superniche content marketing production company, producing technical content for companies that want to reach software engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hughes and his agency were recommended multiple times in our growth marketer survey, which we launched to surface experts that startups can work with. (If you have your own recommendation, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out the survey</a>!) One of the survey respondents noted that developers are underrated as a target audience: It may be niche, but it is a large one. More importantly, they are an audience a growing number of startups need to reach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;If you are going to have subject matter experts write, you also need to have good editors to work with them.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Developer marketing came up in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/mkt1-developer-marketing-is-what-startup-marketing-should-look-like/">our conversation with strategic marketing firm MKT1</a>, so we called on Hughes to learn more. Our discussion covered a lot of ground, from what he has learned and his ambitions to Draft.dev&#8217;s process.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity:</em></p>
<p><b>What kind of clients does Draft.dev work with?</b></p>
<p><strong>Karl Hughes: </strong>Almost all of our clients are developer tools companies. Mostly Series A- and Series B-funded, so they have got some funding and some knowledge that content marketing works for their audience. What they are trying to do with us is scale production and make sure that what they are writing is going to resonate with developers.</p>
<p><b>What inspired you to create Draft.dev?</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a software developer, and then most recently was a CTO at a startup in Chicago, so I knew that there were lots of companies trying to reach developers [ … ] and that a lot of them were doing a poor job of it. So last year I wanted to combine my tech knowledge with writing knowledge, and that&#8217;s where Draft.dev came from — and it&#8217;s been awesome!</p>
<p>We get to work both with technical and non-technical marketing and developer relations people to help them get more content out. And even though it&#8217;s marketing content, it&#8217;s super focused on education, because developer marketing is a bit tricky. Developers can be a bit skeptical of marketing, so you have to be nuanced in your approach. You have to be genuinely helpful, so we really try to focus on helpful content that is also a net positive for the client.</p>
<p><b>What are some mistakes that you see companies making when creating content for developers?</b></p>
<p>There are a couple of big challenges that Draft.dev is specifically built to solve: Relying too much on your own team to create content when they are busy and have other priorities, and thinking that you can just get your general copywriting agency to cover developer topics. It usually doesn&#8217;t work well.</p>
<p>Many companies start off getting their engineers to write content and make the mistake of thinking this will work forever. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a continuous integration tool and you want to write content that shows developers how your tool works and that it&#8217;s a good option. Marketing teams will go to developers and say: &#8220;Hey, could you guys write a blog post?&#8221; And they&#8217;ll usually get a few blog posts here and there, but it&#8217;s really hard to build consistent content when these engineers are building the product and have production deadlines to hit.</p>
<p>When you look at companies that have done developer marketing really successfully, like Okta and DigitalOcean, you see that they have dedicated teams to produce this content. There&#8217;s a reason for that: It&#8217;s almost impossible to get your engineers to write everything that you need to produce high-quality and consistent content over time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4tMmvMG8bm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/okta-launches-a-new-free-developer-plan/">Okta launches a new free developer plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta launches a new free developer plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/okta-launches-a-new-free-developer-plan/embed/#?secret=4tMmvMG8bm" data-secret="4tMmvMG8bm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other big mistake that I see companies making is thinking that a general marketing writer or SEO copywriter can write great content for developers. That is super rare. I mean, I&#8217;ve probably met two or three who can do a decent job of making it look like they know enough to speak with some authority. In general, you either want somebody — either at your company or otherwise — who knows the tool.</p>
<p>So for example, if I ask a general SEO copywriter, &#8220;Could you write about how to write a SQL query that does X, Y and Z?&#8221;, maybe they can hack some other articles together and come up with something, but it&#8217;s certainly not going to have the authority that a real software developer has.</p>
<p>This is true in any area where you have to rely on subject matter experts to help you with marketing content, but because my background is in development, I knew that this was a huge problem for companies.</p>
<p><b>How does Draft.dev address that?</b></p>
<p>We are definitely not right for every company. But for companies that are looking to scale-up content production and have technical authority behind those pieces, that&#8217;s where we come in. Typically, these are companies that know they want to do developer content, but are stretched too thin on their engineering team or they have tried freelancers and have a really hard time managing them and keeping quality consistent. So they come to us to do that.</p>
<p>We solve that problem with a huge pool of software developers who write for us on the side. Right now we have about 50 or 60 active monthly writers who are all software developers; they work full-time jobs and do this at night and on weekends. We bring people who are actually in the field, doing these things every day. They bring that technical expertise to the articles that we create for clients.</p>
<p>The mutually beneficial aspect here is that while we obviously pay these writers, they also get a byline out on the client&#8217;s site. We don&#8217;t do a lot of ghostwriting, which is a little unique, but is really good for our style of content because you want to show subject matter expertise. It&#8217;s preferable when you don&#8217;t have your head of marketing listed as the author of every piece of developer content. It&#8217;s nice to have a byline by a real software developer.</p>
<p>All of this goes back to what your content strategy is and who you want to reach. This is not blanket advice for everybody, but for companies trying to reach developers who are writing code every day, I think it&#8217;s super helpful to have some technical authority from people actually doing this.</p>
<p><b>How do you make sure your writers have subject matter expertise?</b></p>
<p>We have a writer vetting and selection process. Once we have vetted the writers who have applied, we also look for the best match for each article. We are looking through their skills and past experience to see who&#8217;d be the best fit.</p>
<p>We also recruit specific writers to write about niche topics. Sometimes that means doing cold outreach; sometimes it means going through our networks and figuring out who we know who&#8217;s written about Rust before. Things like that can be really tricky and time-consuming for a marketing team to do, but because we are doing this full time for lots of clients, we can spread that work around. It makes a lot of sense, and our clients like that we do this for them.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;“Developers, as you know, do not like to pay for things”&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/embed/#?secret=CWRfqsYS4l" data-secret="CWRfqsYS4l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>How to you balance your writers&#8217; technical expertise versus writing skills?</b></p>
<p>That is tough! But there are some best practices in this field. If you are going to have subject matter experts write, you also need to have good editors to work with them.</p>
<p>There are two sides to how we get high-quality content from software engineers who may be average writers when they start, and are often ESL speakers. The upfront part is that we plan content pretty thoroughly. We go back and forth with the content to make sure we know what we are producing, and we also have technical content planners who make sure that each article has a story, an outline and lot of structure before we give it to a writer.</p>
<p>The writer fills in the technical details and personal experience, and then every piece will go through three rounds of edits to get it up to our standards: a technical review; a developmental edit for things like structure and flow, and a copy edit.</p>
<p><b>How do you split these tasks?</b></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve refined this process a lot since starting this [in May 2020]. Initially, it was just me and my managing editor Chris [Wolfgang] — she had a lot of experience in editing, so she could do full-stack editing, and I was focused on writing, picking writers, reviewing, etc. That&#8217;s how we divided things in the early days, but as we grew, we realized that we wouldn&#8217;t find an army of Chrises and Karls.</p>
<p>We had to figure out how to split these jobs into specialities where people can do their best work, and that&#8217;s how we managed to scale and keep quality high while growing at the pace we have. We now have five full-time people and we work with over 35 startups of various sizes, so we are still a small business, but it has been growing very quickly.</p>
<p><b>How do you get new clients?</b></p>
<p>Our biggest source of new business has been referrals. Clients who work with us love what we do and refer us to other people. We have also ended up working with companies going through accelerator programs like Y Combinator, so when new YC companies ask who does developer content, they hear about us. Besides us there&#8217;s probably just a couple of other companies that specialize in this. It&#8217;s a very small field so we get mentioned a lot.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Growth has been so organic at the moment that I haven&#8217;t pursued a lot of active outreach strategies, but we are starting to get better at boosting this [organic growth]. One of the first hires I made this year was an account manager who&#8217;s helped with maintaining relationships with existing clients and getting things like testimonials, case studies, etc. Another thing is that when people see our content, they ask the company who did it, because companies that are selling developers tools really need a way to produce this kind of content, and there aren&#8217;t many providers.</p>
<p><b>How do you complement your clients&#8217; own content production efforts?</b></p>
<p>Our two sweet spots are bigger companies that are looking to augment their in-house content team, because they have a hard time keeping developer content going, and really small teams that are building a tool specifically for software developers and need to get going with content production or ramp it up.</p>
<p>A lot of our clients will have something like a community writer program in addition to what we provide. For instance, we work with Strapi, which is an open-source tool that has a big community with community writers writing about how they use Strapi.</p>
<p>But then they use us to augment that content, because they want to be able to set some topics themselves. A lot of times, community contributions are good for whatever your community happens to be working on, but you can&#8217;t necessarily ask your community to write about X or Y.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Headless CMS company Strapi raises another $10 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/headless-cms-company-strapi-raises-another-10-million/embed/#?secret=GQPho6gT3c" data-secret="GQPho6gT3c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other challenge here is that with any developer-focused community writing program, you are going to need to spend a lot on editing. A lot of companies underestimate the work it is going to take. That&#8217;s where we come in: Instead of hiring all these different people you need and trying to build your own process, you can slot Draft.dev in there for a while. If some day you want to go hire your own team and replace us, that&#8217;s great — we&#8217;d love you to outgrow us. But ideally, we&#8217;d like to stick around and always be part of your developer content efforts.</p>
<p><b>Do you also do anything related to content distribution, such as writing the tweets that go with the articles?</b></p>
<p>We just started doing that; it&#8217;s our first big add-on service, where for each piece of content we&#8217;ll create social media collateral, like a couple of tweets, LinkedIn posts and Reddit submissions with the subreddits they would be most appropriate for. Then the client just has someone on their team copy-paste and schedule it with whatever system they want.</p>
<p>We also send a full promotional checklist they can use to promote the content, because one of the challenges I see with some of the smaller companies we work with is that they sometimes get lost when it comes to getting the content we produce in front of people. If you are not a developer, it&#8217;s hard to come up with copy about a technical piece. So by offering that collateral, we&#8217;re making it a bit easier. It&#8217;s been our first foray into this. We could expand into other things in the future, but that would probably be next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Satellite connectivity company Swarm&#8217;s new product will give anyone the ability to create a messaging or Internet of Things (IoT) device, whether that be a hiker looking to stay connected off the grid or a hobbyist wanting to track the weather.</p>
<p>The Swarm Evaluation Kit is an all-in-one product that includes a Swarm Tile, the company’s flagship modem device, a VHF antenna, a small solar panel, a tripod, a Feather S2 development board and an OLED from Adafruit. The entire kit comes in at less than 6 pounds and costs $499. The package may sound intimidatingly technical, but Swarm CEO Sara Spangelo explained to TechCrunch that it was designed to be user-friendly, from the most novice consumer all the way through to more advanced users.</p>
<p>It “was super intentional to call it an evaluation kit because it’s not a finished product,” Spangelo explained. “It serves two different kinds of groups. The first group is people that want to be able to do messaging anywhere that they are on the planet for a really low cost. &#8230; The second group of people will be the tinkerers and the hobbyists and educational folks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This is the second consumer product for Swarm &#8212; it went commercially live with its flagship Swarm Tile earlier this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/swarms-low-cost-satellite-data-network-is-now-available-to-commercial-clients/">The Swarm Tile</a> is a key part of the company’s ecosystem, which includes a few different components: the Tile, a kind of modem that can be embedded in different things and what the customer interfaces with; the satellite network; and a ground station network, which is how the company downlinks data. The Tile is designed for maximum compatibility, so Swarm serves customers across sectors including shipping, logistics and agriculture.</p>
<p>“One of the cool things about Swarm is that we&#8217;re infrastructure,” she said. “We&#8217;re like cellphone towers, so anyone can use us across any vertical.” Some of the use cases she highlighted included customers using Tile in soil moisture sensors, or in asset tracking in the trucking industry.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Swarm&#8217;s low-cost satellite data network is now available to commercial clients&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/swarms-low-cost-satellite-data-network-is-now-available-to-commercial-clients/embed/#?secret=l68jNK3fWc" data-secret="l68jNK3fWc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A major part of Swarm’s business model is its low cost, with a Swarm Tile costing $119 and the connectivity service available for only $5 per month per connected device. Spangelo credits not only the engineering innovations in the tiny devices and satellites, but the gains in launch economics, especially for small satellite developers like Swarm. The company also sells direct, which further reduces overhead.</p>
<p>Swarm was founded by Spangelo, a pilot and aerospace engineering Ph.D. who spent time at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab and at Google on its drone delivery project, Wing. She told TechCrunch that Swarm started as a hobby project between her and co-founder Ben Longmier, who had previously founded a company called Aether Industries that made high-altitude balloon platforms.</p>
<p>“Then [we] realized that we could do communications at speeds that were similar to what the legacy players are doing today,” Spangelo said. “There was a lot of buzz around connectivity,” she added, noting that initiatives like Project Loon were garnering a lot of funding. But instead of trying to match the size and scale of some of these multi-year projects, they decided to go small.</p>
<p>In the four and a half years since the company’s founding, Swarm has put up a network of 120 sandwich-sized satellites into low Earth orbit and grown its workforce to 32 people. They’ve also been busy onboarding customers that use the Tile. One hope is that the kit will be an additional way to draw customers to Swarm’s service.</p>
<p>Spangelo said the kit is for “everybody in between, that likes to just play with things. And it&#8217;s not just playing &#8212; the playing leads to innovations and ideas, and then it gets deployed out into the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Divorce is messy and stressful, made even messier and stressful when a couple is unable to go through the legal process because of the cost. Online divorce startup Hello Divorce is developing a platform to make this process more affordable and quicker.</p>
<p>To do this, the Oakland, California-based company announced Thursday a $2 million seed round led by CEAS, with additional funds coming from Lightbank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Gaingels and a group of individuals including Clio CEO Jack Newton, WRG’s Lisa Stone and Equity ESQ led by Ed Diab.</p>
<p>Statistics show there are an average of <a href="https://legaljobs.io/blog/divorce-rate-in-america/">750,000 divorces in the U.S. each year</a>, and the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/money/2020/01/21/divorce-us-heres-how-much-costs-separate-each-state/4502754002/">average total cost of divorce</a> can cost anywhere between $8,400 to $17,500 depending on what state you live in. Overall, some sources value the <a href="https://video.vice.com/en_us/topic/conscious-uncoupling">divorce industry at $50 billion</a> annually.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Family law attorney Erin Levine founded the company in 2018 so that couples getting a divorce could access “affordable meaningful legal counsel” and resources beyond online forms. Levine told TechCrunch that the billable hours model for lawyers is “an antiquated process” for consumers that want an easier and clearer path to divorce.</p>
<p>“Right now, lawyers are the keeper of information, and clients keep paying until the divorce is done,” she said. “Divorce is more than forms. It is a challenging time, and most people need or want support. I saw a big hole there to use technology and fixed fees to put couples in the driver’s seat and take down that level of conflict.”</p>
<p>With this seed round, the company plans on rapidly scaling legal filing options across the U.S., improving its ground-breaking product, and giving consumers more of the content and services they need to feel informed and in control of their divorce process.</p>
<p>Hello Divorce provides software and accessible legal services starting at $99 for a do-it-yourself option or for up to an average of $2,000 for legal help along the way to finish the divorce process in a third of the time, and completely remote.</p>
<p>Levine said most people spend between two and five years contemplating divorce, and during that time are scared they will not be able to afford it, and if they have children, are afraid of losing them. Of those people, 80% won’t be able to access counsel.</p>
<p>Though the company is already profitable, Levine went after venture capital to be able to build an infrastructure and tap into the guidance that CEAS and other investors, like Lightbank’s Eric Ong bring to the table, saying “it is clear what I do know and what I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Ong said he met Levine through co-investors on the round, who told him Hello Divorce was something he would resonate with. Lightbank invests in category-stage companies, and he was drawn to what Levine and her team were doing.</p>
<p>“They are a combination of industry expertise and thinking outside of the box,” he said. “Eighty percent of people are still not getting meaningful representation, and we looked for technology that would provide a customer value proposition and we didn’t find one until Hello Divorce.”</p>
<p>The company plans to use the seed funding to scale legal filing options across the U.S., on product development and new content and services to educate people coming to Hello Divorce’s website.</p>
<p>The service is already available in four states — California, Colorado, Texas and Utah. Levine said the choice of initial states was strategic: She is familiar with California law, while Colorado has a complex system for divorce. Texas does not have a streamlined way for same-sex couples to get divorces, something Levine said she wanted to tackle, and Utah has a new regulatory scheme. Up next, she is expanding to New York and Florida, where she will launch in a bilingual format.</p>
<p>Since 2018, Hello Divorce has grown 100% year over year, with divorce success rates of 95% after starting the process on the platform. Over the past year, the company received 2,000 inquiries related to how to shelter in place with someone while contemplating divorce and co-parenting during lockdown.</p>
<p>“The inquiries increased about staying or going, and what divorce will look like,” Levine said. “It will be awhile before we see the total effects of what divorce looks like following the pandemic.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One year after voice-based AI technology company ConverseNow raised a $3.3 million seed round, the company is back with a cash infusion of $15 million in Series A funding.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year after voice-based AI technology company <a href="https://www.conversenow.ai">ConverseNow</a> raised a $3.3 million seed round, the company is back with a cash infusion of $15 million in Series A funding in a round led by Craft Ventures.</p>
<p>The Austin-based company’s AI voice ordering assistants George and Becky work inside quick-serve restaurants to take orders via phone, chat, drive-thru and self-service kiosks, freeing up staff to concentrate on food preparation and customer service.</p>
<p>Joining Craft in the Series A round were LiveOak Venture Partners, Tensility Venture Partners, Knoll Ventures, Bala Investments, 2048 Ventures, Bridge Investments, Moneta Ventures and angel investors Federico Castellucci and Ashish Gupta. This new investment brings ConverseNow’s total funding to $18.3 million, Vinay Shukla, co-founder and CEO of ConverseNow, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Bryan Rosenblatt, partner at Craft Ventures, is joining the company’s board of directors, and said in a written statement that “post-pandemic, quick-service restaurants are primed for digital transformation, and we see a unique opportunity for ConverseNow to become a driving force in the space.”</p>
<p>At the time when ConverseNow raised its seed funding in 2020, it was piloting its technology in just a handful of stores. Today, it is live in over 750 stores and grew seven times in revenue and five times in headcount.</p>
<p>Restaurants were some of the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic, and as they reopen, Shukla said their two main problems will be labor and supply chain, and “that is where our technology intersects.”</p>
<p>The AI assistants are able to step in during peak times when workers are busy to help take orders so that customers are not waiting to place their orders, or calls get dropped or abandoned, something Shukla said happens often.</p>
<p>It can also drive more business. ConverseNow said it is shown to increase average orders by 23% and revenue by 20%, while adding up to 12 hours of extra deployable labor time per store per week.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Rahul Aggarwal said more people prefer to order remotely, which has led to an increase in volume. However, the more workers have to multitask, the less focus they have on any one job.</p>
<p>“If you step into restaurants with ConverseNow, you see them reimagined,” Aggarwal said. “You find workers focusing on the job they like to do, which is preparing food. It is also driving better work balance, while on the customer side, you don’t have to wait in the queue. Operators have more time to churn orders, and service time comes down.”</p>
<p>ConverseNow is one of the startups within the global <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/restaurant-management-software-market">restaurant management software market</a> that is forecasted to reach $6.94 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research. Over the past year, startups in the space attracted both investors and acquirers. For example, point-of-sale software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lightspeed-acquires-upserve/">Lightspeed acquired Upserve</a> in December for $430 million. Earlier this year, Sunday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/sunday-raises-24-million-seed-round-to-build-a-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">raised $24 million</a> for its checkout technology.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable ConverseNow to continue developing its line-busting technology and invest in marketing, sales and product innovation. It will also be working on building a database from every conversation and onboarding new customers quicker, which involves inputting the initial menu.</p>
<p>By leveraging artificial intelligence, the company will be able to course-correct any inconsistencies, like background noise on a call, and better predict what a customer might be saying. It will also correct missing words and translate the order better. In the future, Shukla and Aggarwal also want the platform to be able to tell what is going on around the restaurant — what traffic is like, the weather and any menu promotions to drive upsell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Carl Pei says he looked around and saw a lot of the same. He’s not alone in that respect. Apple didn’t invent the fully wireless earbud with the first AirPods, but it did provide a kind of inflection point that sent many of its competitors hurtling toward a sort of homogeneity. You’d be hard-pressed to cite another consumer electronics category that matured and coalesced as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds, but finding something unique among the hordes is another question entirely.</p>
<p>These days, a pair of perfectly serviceable wireless earbuds are one click and $50 away. Spend $200, and you can get something truly excellent. But variety? That’s a different question entirely. Beyond choosing between a long-stemmed AirPods-style design and something a bit rounder, there’s really not a lot of diversification. Up until recently, features like active noise canceling and wireless charging bifurcated the category into premium and non-premium tiers, but they’ve both become increasingly ubiquitous.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182585" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9591.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, let’s say you’re launching a new consumer hardware company in 2021. And let’s say you decided your first product is going to be a pair of earbuds. Where does that leave you? How are you going to not only differentiate yourself in a crowded market but compete alongside giants like Samsung, Google and Apple?</p>
<p>Price is certainly a factor, and $99 is aggressive. Pei seemed to regret pricing the Ear (1) at less than $100 in our first conversation. It’s probably safe to say Nothing’s not exactly going to be cleaning up on every unit sold. And much like his prior company — OnePlus — he seems reluctant to position cost as a defining characteristic.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Here’s Nothing’s $99 Ear (1) buds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/heres-nothings-99-ear-1-buds/embed/#?secret=K8VARfPYti" data-secret="K8VARfPYti" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a conversation prior to the Ear (1) launch, Pei’s take on the state of the industry was a kind of “feature glut.” Certainly, there’s been a never-ending spec race across different categories over the last several years. And it’s true that it’s getting more difficult to differentiate based on features — look at what smartphone makers have been dealing with the last several years. Wireless headphones, meanwhile, jumped from the “exciting early-stage mess” stage to “the actually pretty good” stage in record time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182580" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182580" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9599.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I do think there’s still room for feature differentiation. Take the recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/nura-finally-goes-fully-wireless-with-the-nuratrue-buds/">NuraTrue headphones</a>. That company has taken an opposite approach to arrive at earbuds, beginning with a specialized audio technology that it’s built three different headphone models around.</p>
<p>Pei noted in the Ear (1) launch presser that the company determined its aesthetic ideals prior to deciding what its first product would be. And true to form, its partnership with the design firm Teenage Engineering was announced well before a single image of the product appeared (the best we got in the early days was an early concept inspired by Pei’s grandmother’s tobacco pipe).</p>
<p>There are other ideals, as well — concepts about ecosystems, but those are the sorts of things that can only come after the release of multiple products. In the meantime, we’ve seen the product from all angles. I’m wearing the product in the ears and holding it in my hand (though I’m putting it down now; too hard to type).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182569" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182569" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9627.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The form factor certainly borrows from the AirPods, from the long stems to the white buds from which they protrude. You can’t say that they’re entirely their own thing in that respect. But perhaps a case can be made that the nature of fully wireless earbuds is, in and of itself, limiting in the manner of form factors it can accommodate. I’m certainly not a product designer, but they need to sit comfortably in your ears, and they can’t be too big or too heavy or protrude too much.</p>
<p>According to Pei, part of the product’s delayed launch was due to the company going back to the drawing board to rethink designs. What they ultimately arrived at was something recognizable as a pair of earbuds, while offering some unique flourishes. Transparency is the primary differentiator from an aesthetic standpoint. It comes into play in a big way with the case, which is unique, as these things go. With the buds themselves, most of the transparency happens on the stems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182578" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9602.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182578" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>In a vacuum, the buds look a fair bit like an Apple product. The glossy white finish and white silicone tips are a big part of that. The reason the entire buds aren’t transparent, as early renderings showed, is a simple and pragmatic one: the components in the buds are too unsightly. That brings us to another element in the product’s eventual delay: making a gadget clear requires putting thought into how things like components and glue look. It’s the same reason why there’s a big white strip in the middle of an otherwise clear case: charging components are ugly (sorry/not sorry).</p>
<p>It’s a potential recipe for overly busy design, but I think the team landed on something solid — and certainly distinctive. That alone should account for something in the homogeneous world of gadget design. And the company’s partnership with StockX should be a pretty clear indication of precisely the sorts of early adopters/influencers Nothing is going after here.</p>
<p>The Ear (1) buds are a lot more welcoming than any of the style-first experiments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/will-i-am/">Will.i.am made in the category.</a> And while they’re distinct, they don’t really stand out in the wild — which is to say, no one’s going to scream and point or stop you in the street to figure what’s going on with your ears (sorry, Will).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182577" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182577" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182577" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9610.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182577" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Ultimately, I dig the look. There are nice touches, as well. A red and white dot indicate the right and left buds, respectively, a nod to RCA and other audio cables. A subtle Nothing logo is etched in dotted text, bringing to mind circuit board printing. The letter extends to most of Nothing’s branding. It’s clear the design was masterminded by people who have spent a lot of time negotiating with supply-chain vendors. Notably, the times I spoke to Pei, he was often in and around Shenzhen rather than the company’s native London, hammering out last-minute supply issues.</p>
<p>The buds feel really great, too. I’ve noted my tendency to suffer from ear pain wearing various earbud designs for extended periods. On Monday, I took a four hour intra-borough walk and didn’t notice a thing. They also stayed in place like champs on visits to the gym. And not for nothing, but there’s an extremely satisfying magnetic snap when you place them back in the charging case (the red and white dots still apply).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182566" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182566" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9631.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182566" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The case is flat and square with rounded edges (a squircle, if you please). If it wasn’t clear, it might closely resemble a tin of mints. It also offers a pretty satisfying snap when shutting. Will be curious to see how well that stands up after several hundred — or thousand — openings and closings.</p>
<p>Though the company says it put the product through all of the standard drop and stress tests, it warns that even the strongest transparent plastic is still prone to scratching, particularly with a set of keys in the same pocket. Pei says that kind of battle scarring will ultimately be part of its charm, but the jury’s still out on that one. After a few days and no keys in close proximity, I have one long scratch across the bottom. I don’t feel any cooler, but you tell me.</p>
<p>A large concave circle on the top helps keep the lid from slamming into the earbuds when closing. It’s also a nice spot to put your thumb when fiddling around with the thing. I suspect it doubles to relieve some of that fidgeting we (I) usually release by absentmindedly flipping a case lid up and down. It’s a small, but thoughtful touch. Round back, you’ll find the USB-C charging port and Bluetooth sync button.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182570" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9626.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>On iOS, you’ll need to connect the buds both through the app and in the Bluetooth settings the first time. There are disadvantages when you don’t make your own operating system, chips and phones in addition to earbuds. That’s a minor (probably one-time) nuisance, though.</p>
<p>The Ear (1) are a decent sounding pair of $99 headphones. I won’t say I was blown away, but I don’t think anyone is going to be disappointed that they don’t really go head-to-head with, say, the Sony WF-1000xM4 or even the new NuraTrue. These aren’t audiophile headphones, but they’re very much suitable for walking around the city, listening to music and podcasts.</p>
<p>The app offers a built-in equalizer tuned by Teenage Engineering with three settings: balanced, more treble/more bass, and voice (for podcasts, et al.). The differences are detectable, but pretty subtle, as far as these things go. As far as equalizer customizations go, it’s more point-and-shoot than DSLR, as Nothing doesn’t want you straying too far from the intended balance. After experimenting with all of the settings, I mostly stuck with the balanced setting. Feel free to judge me accordingly.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2182572,2182566,2182587,2182586,2182585,2182584,2182583,2182581,2182580,2182579,2182578,2182577,2182575,2182574,2182573,2182571,2182570,2182569,2182568,2182567"]</p>
<p>There are three ANC settings, as well: noise cancellation, transparency and off. You can also titrate the noise cancellation between light and heavy. On the whole, the ANC did a fine job erasing a fair bit of street noise on my New York City walks, though even at heavy, it’s not going to, say, block out the sound of a car altogether. For my sake, that’s maybe for the best.</p>
<p>There’s also a built-in &#8220;find my earbud&#8221; setting that sends out a kind of piercing chirp so you can find the one that is inevitably trapped beneath your couch cushion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182573" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182573" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2182573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_9621.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182573" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>My big complaint day today is one I encountered with the NuraTrue. I ran into a number of Bluetooth connection dropouts. It’s a bit annoying when you’re really engrossed in a song or podcast. And again, it’s something you’re a lot less likely to encounter for those companies that build their own buds, phone, chips and operating systems. It’s a pretty tough thing to compete with for a brand-new startup.</p>
<p>I have quibbles, and in spite of months of excited teases, the Ear (1) buds aren’t going to turn the overcrowded category upside down. But it’s always exciting to see a new company enter the consumer hardware space — and deliver a solid first product out of the game. It’s an idiosyncratic take on the category at a nice price from a company worth keeping an eye on.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The startup runs a marketplace that links college-age talent to companies in need of their services. Social media and web developer work are popular on the Pangea platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, a Providence, Rhode Island-based startup that connects youthful talent and businesses in need of freelance labor, announced this morning that it has closed an oversubscribed $2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Pangea CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean?lang=en">Adam Alpert</a> told TechCrunch that his company had set out to secure $1.5 million, but wound up raising more. We&#8217;re hearing that somewhat often these days.</p>
<p>IDEA Fund Partners&#8217; Lister Delgado led the round. Other investors in the transaction included Unpopular Ventures, Brown Angel Group, PJC and a number of individuals.</p>
<p>The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">graduated from Y Combinator earlier in the year</a>, raising a check from the accelerator and another $350,000 since it closed a $400,000 pre-seed round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/pangea-app-raises-400k-seed-round-to-help-connect-student-workers-with-businesses/">last April</a>. All told, Pangea has raised around $3 million.</p>
<p>The startup runs a marketplace that links college-age talent to companies in need of their services. Given the skillset of many college students, social media and web developer work are popular on the Pangea platform.</p>
<p>The model is scaling. Per Alpert and his co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntambunting/">John Tambunting</a>, gross merchandise volume (GMV), or the value of sold services on Pangea&#8217;s market, rose 400% on a year-over-year basis in Q2 2021. And the CEO disclosed earlier in July that the company&#8217;s GMV rose 40% in the preceding four weeks.</p>
<p>For context, TechCrunch reported that Pangea was &#8220;facilitating $50,000 in transactions between college freelancers and businesses&#8221; in March 2021. That figure should now be heading toward the $100,000 monthly GMV run-rate threshold. We&#8217;ll annoy the company for new growth figures when Q3 ends.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The latest Pangea round was a priced event, meaning that the startup has graduated from the comfortable early-stage realm of SAFEs and other related instruments. The seed round values the company into the modest end of the eight-figure range.</span></p>
<p>What will Pangea use the money for? To scale its human capital. The company, currently four full-time staff, intends to more than double to nine.</p>
<p>And because it is based in Providence, a cheaper market than New York or San Francisco, its new capital will give it more time to grow. Alpert told TechCrunch that its seed capital will give it &#8220;20-25 product cycles,&#8221; the first time that we&#8217;ve heard runway expressed in that particular manner. We like it.</p>
<p>The CEO said that building in Providence, a &#8220;smaller city,&#8221; allows Pangea to better focus. And he said that because investors are now willing to invest remotely, the location is not particularly remote.</p>
<p>The startup is not the only upstart technology company in town. Alpert told TechCrunch that the Providence startup scene is starting to grow, saying that &#8220;a year ago, there was very little happening, but now there are now several other venture-backed, seed-stage startups here all working on the same floor as us.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently swung by the company&#8217;s office where its staff and collected summer interns were meeting. (Disclosure: Your scribe is not a very good photographer):</p>

<p>Pangea now has more capital than it has ever had to keep building out its product lineup, scale GMV and start extending its runway with revenue growth. Let&#8217;s see how far this seed round can take it, and how long it takes the startup to reach Series A scale.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Odoo is the first unicorn out of Wallonia, the region in Belgium where it is based.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open source has become a major force in the world of IT, and today a startup that has built a profitable operation by developing business management software on the principle is announcing a sizable secondary investment on the back of that growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.odoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Odoo</a> &#8212; a Belgium-based provider of open-source-based business software that ranges from inventory management and ERP to human resources and CRM software, marketing tools and more, some 30,000 in all &#8212; has received $215 million from Summit Partners.</p>
<p>This is a secondary investment, meaning Summit is buying shares from existing investors (specifically Sofinnova Partners and XAnge). Odoo is profitable and has been so for years, CEO and founder Fabien Pinckaers explained in an interview earlier, and so it didn&#8217;t need to raise more cash by giving away more equity. He added that this investment values the startup at over €2 billion (or over $2.3 billion at current rates), making Odoo the first unicorn out of Wallonia, the region in Belgium where it is based. That in itself is notable; it&#8217;s a sign of the evolving decentralization of the tech world beyond Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>This is the second time Summit, which was one of Odoo&#8217;s earliest (equity) backers, has snapped up secondary shares. The firm made a similar investment of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/odoo-grabs-90m-to-sell-more-smes-on-its-business-app-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$90 million in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>With 7 million users on its platform, Odoo is a prime example of the strong payoffs to be had from economies of scale in the most successful open-source projects, but it&#8217;s also doing so with a twist.</p>
<p>On the open-source front, Odoo provides a version of its services that is &#8220;open source&#8221; and free, which Pinckaers said contains about 80% of all of its features. It then offers a paid, proprietary version of the product with the remaining 20% of features (full details on <a href="https://www.odoo.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing here</a>).</p>
<p>About 90% of Odoo&#8217;s customer base takes the free tier, he said, with only 10% taking the paid, proprietary tier. But with 7 million users, that is enough to run the business at a profit big enough that it can continue investing in growth without giving away more equity.</p>
<p>What is also notable is how Odoo pitches itself. While a lot of open source has been seen as the domain of developers and others in the technical community, Odoo designs software on its platform that is actually aimed at others in the workplace, not engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are one of the only exceptions of open source built for nontechnical users,&#8221; Pinckaers said.</p>
<p>It targets users both directly via its SaaS platform and via an extensive channel partner operation, where channel partners will host the services themselves. Its traction with these partners is strong, he added, because of the free nature of Odoo (which is not only a contrast to the SAPs, Microsofts and Oracles of the world, but at times a much easier sell around which a channel partner can provide other paid services). There are nearly 4,000 partners now, he added, with another 90,000 individual community members contributing software on the Odoo platform.</p>
<p>The company has been growing revenues and customers at a rate of 50% over the last 10 years (and 63% over the past 15 &#8212; it&#8217;s been around since 2005), and it now has 1,700 employees with plans to add another 1,000 this year. Billings are expected to be €160 million in 2021. Pinckaers said that Odoo&#8217;s next steps will be to continue growing the software that it provides to users on its platform. Specifically, it is focusing on e-commerce and website development, he said, two areas that he feels could benefit from more nontechnical, user-friendly open-source tools.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to support the Odoo team for this next phase of growth,” Han Sikkens, managing director and head of Europe at Summit Partners, said in a statement. “We believe the future is bright, and Odoo clearly has the potential to disrupt the market led by software giants like SAP, MS Dynamics and Oracle.” Sikkens is joining the board with this round.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Realm, which aims to help homeowners maximize the value of their property with its data platform, has raised $12 million in Series A funding led by GGV Capital.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.myrealm.co/">Realm</a>, which aims to help homeowners maximize the value of their property with its data platform, has raised $12 million in Series A funding led by GGV Capital.</p>
<p>Existing backers Primary Venture Partners, Lerer Hippeau and Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures also participated in the round, bringing the New York-based startup’s total raised to $15 million.</p>
<p>Realm founder Liz Young launched the platform earlier this year with the goal of providing “a one-stop-shop for accessible, actionable home advice.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, Realm says it has helped over 20,000 homeowners “uncover” an average of $175,000 in property value. Its user base is growing 20% month over month.</p>
<p>What makes the company different from other valuation offerings out there, according to Young, is that rather than telling owners what their homes are worth today, Realm can tell them what their home could be worth after renovations in months and years to come.</p>
<p>“There are a ton of tools and services that make it easier to buy or sell your home, but once you move, it&#8217;s a total black box,” she said. “You&#8217;re left trying to cobble together advice from fragmented, often biased resources to navigate big, expensive decisions. There&#8217;s nowhere else consumers spend so much money, with such little actionable information.”</p>
<p>For example, using data extracted from a variety of sources such as tax assessors and its own users, Realm can tell a homeowner in real-time how their property value will change if they do things like makeover a bathroom or add a new deck. Its algorithms can assess a property and offer advice on what projects are most likely to add value.</p>
<p>“The public data that we acquire, the data we ingest from users, and the data that we build ourselves has allowed us to build the most robust and unique actionable real estate data set in the U.S.,” Young told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Realm’s database is free and, according to Young, offers insights on over 70 million single-family detached homes across the U.S.</p>
<p>Part of that is determined by zoning data, which tells people where they can and cannot build on a property.</p>
<p>“It’s really important because square feet is one of the biggest drivers of home value,” Young said. “So if you&#8217;re trying to understand how much a home&#8217;s worth or could be worth, you really have to understand the local zoning rules.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183303" style="width: 1033px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183303" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183303 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg 1023w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Realm</p></div></p>
<p>Realm’s marketplace offering, where an adviser connects owners to contractors, architects and lenders that can carry out the company’s recommendations, is currently only live in California but will be expanding to new markets over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>“People can digitally consume our free insights but a lot want help interpreting them,” Young said.</p>
<p>The company plans to use its new capital to “improve the quality and sophistication of the platform’s data insights” and toward hiring across its data science, engineering, marketing and operations teams. It will also continue to develop its proprietary data sets and models, which offer homeowners across the country personalized analysis of over 70 million homes.<br />
A lot of Realm’s business is driven by its relationships with agents and word of mouth via its existing user base.</p>
<p>Jeff Richards, GGV managing partner and new Realm board member, said that when his firm backs at the Series A level, its bet is “100% on the founder.”</p>
<p>“I met Liz when she was raising her seed round in July 2020 and was blown away,” he told TechCrunch. “She’s smart, ambitious and has a deep background in the space she’s going after. Although it was early, I could tell she was thinking big.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183301" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183301" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2183301 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="398" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183301" class="wp-caption-text">Founder and CEO Liz Young.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Realm</p></div></p>
<p>He points out that GGV Capital, with $9.2 billion in assets under management, is a longtime investor in other proptechs, including Opendoor, Divvy Homes, Belong and Airbnb.</p>
<p>“Zillow made it easy for people to find a home to buy. Opendoor made it easy to buy and sell a home,” Richards told TechCrunch. “Airbnb made it easy to rent a home for a short-term vacation. Belong is making it easy to rent a home for the long term.”</p>
<p>Realm, according to Richards, was right in GGV’s “sweet spot.”</p>
<p>“No one has zeroed in on helping the individual homeowner manage their home, and that’s the opportunity area Liz is going after,” he said. “We kept in touch after the seed round, she pinged me to talk about her A, we met up and I gave her a term sheet 48 hours later.”</p>
<p>In general, Richards believes that residential real estate is one of the biggest spend categories in the U.S. and yet is still virtually untouched by technology.</p>
<p>Home sales are over $1.6 trillion annually, home improvement is one of the biggest categories in the U.S. at over $500 billion annually, and the <a href="https://st.hzcdn.com/static/econ/2021--US-Houzz-and-Home-Study.pdf">average home renovation project in the U.S. is around $15,000</a>, with many spending over $50,000.</p>
<p>“I’ve owned a home for 17 years and almost everything I do with respect to the home is the same as it was over a decade ago. The only thing that has really changed is I can manage my thermostat and cameras with my phone,&#8221; Richards said. “Literally everything else is the same — the way I do renovations, the way I find contractors to do repairs, the way I pay my mortgage, etc. — exactly the same. That’s ridiculous! Liz sees a huge opportunity here, and so do we. The market is enormous. So there will be many, many winners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is back in business launching rockets after an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/"> issue during its last launch in May</a> caused a total loss of the payloads on board. The company was quick to investigate the issue and announced just over a week ago that it had completed that work, identified the problem and implemented corrective action to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>The launch today, which took off from the company&#8217;s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, was an important one to get right: It delivered a satellite for the U.S. Space Force to low Earth orbit. This is the second Space Force mission that Rocket Lab has provided launch services for.</p>
<p>On board the Electron launch vehicle for this mission was a demonstration satellite called Monolith, which is equipped with a new kind of deployable sensor that could, if it works as designed, pave the way for significantly smaller satellite buses in future spacecraft designs for things like weather and observation satellites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This turnaround after a failed launch and loss of client payload is another benefit of Rocket Lab&#8217;s ability to quickly turn around rockets and missions. It&#8217;ll definitely be under increased scrutiny for a little while, however, considering that this latest mishap was the second anomaly to result in mission failure in just under a year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/">Culture Amp</a> was founded in 2009 to let companies conduct anonymous employee surveys, but since then, its focus has expanded to helping employers turn the data they collect into action. The company announced today it has raised $100 million in Series F funding, led by returning investors Sequoia Capital China and TDM Growth Partners. The round bumps Culture Amp’s valuation to $1.5 billion, more than double what it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/employee-survey-startup-culture-amp-closes-82m-funding-round/">was after the company’s Series E in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>New investor Salesforce Ventures, along with existing backers Felicis Ventures, Blackbird Ventures, Index Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Skip Capital, Grok Ventures and Global Founders Capital, also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Culture Amp is now used by more than 4,000 organizations with a total of 25 million employees. Its clients range in size from about 20 to 30 people to more than 150,000 employees and include Salesforce, Unilever, PwC, KIND, SoulCycle and BigCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Employee survey startup Culture Amp closes $82M round led by Sequoia China&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/employee-survey-startup-culture-amp-closes-82m-funding-round/embed/#?secret=XRXFEbuOad" data-secret="XRXFEbuOad" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>From its start as a survey platform, Culture Amp has grown to encompass analytics for managers, like turnover prediction and team goal tracking. It also has a sizable online community where users can connect and book workshops, including ones run by diversity, equity and inclusion experts. Culture Amp recently held a virtual version of Culture First, its annual event, with over 20,000 participants.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Didier Elzinga told TechCrunch that he sees Culture Amp’s Series F as a “validation of the HR space in general.”</p>
<p>“I think for a long time, the HR space and HR tech space have been viewed as not that interesting or important, but what we see now is that people are the most important thing that most companies have, so what can we do to craft their experiences? I think it’s a really interesting step for the space as a whole, for an organization like Culture Amp to have made it to this level of revenue, fundraising and valuation.”</p>
<p>The company still has most of its funds from its Series E, but the new round will allow it to “work at a whole other level of scale,” Elzinga said. Culture Amp launched in Australia, and about two-thirds of its revenue comes from the United States. It is also growing in Europe, so some of its new funding will be used on its dual data centers. Elzinga added that the raise also gives Culture Amp a war chest to spend on acquisitions.</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half, employers have dealt with two major issues: a remote workforce coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and growing calls for diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Culture Amp saw more employers addressing DEI in surveys; for example, the number of companies who asked employees questions like whether they &#8220;build teams that are diverse&#8221; increased about 30% in 2020. Clients have access to surveys created with behavioral psychologists, including ones designed to see if women, people of color or people who use English as a second language are feeling disengaged and, if so, how to help them.</p>
<p>To understand the pandemic&#8217;s impact, the platform introduced well-being templates, asking if employees are feeling overwhelmed, how they feel about messaging from company leaders and gauging their willingness to return to the office.</p>

<p>Surveys are answered anonymously and data is aggregated to protect the privacy of individual employees. To help companies act on the results they get, Culture Amp provides what it calls an “Inspiration Engine,” or practices that have worked for other companies.</p>
<p>Because Culture Amp works with a large group of employers, it is able to create benchmarks by industry, size and region. This allows companies to see how their employee engagement compares to others in the same space.</p>
<p>Another feature, Skills Coach, is based on behavioral science research and helps managers develop “soft skills” through two-minute interactive exercises that are delivered by Slack or email.</p>
<p>“The experience that employees have is the thing we want to up-level, but the way we want to do it and what we’re focused on is lifting managers’ capability to delivery that employee experience,” Elzinga said. Skills Coach was designed to fit into busy workdays and its usage has tripled over the past year, he added.</p>
<p>“We think that for all the progress we have made, we’re still at the beginning of actually delivering on that employee experience,” he added. “I think the last two years have shown us how important mental well-being is, how important diversity and inclusion is, and how important it is for leaders to truly listen to their people and then to act on that and follow up.”</p>
<p>Other employee feedback platforms include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/linkedin-acquires-employee-engagement-and-retention-platform-glint/">Glint</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/qualtrics-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know/">Qualtrics</a>. Elzinga said the main way Culture Amp differentiates is its team of “People Scientists,” or organizational and behavioral psychologists who design surveys, work in its product team as analysts and serve as consultants for clients.</p>

<p>“We see ourselves at the point now where we have enough data that we can start to do primary research on a lot of these issues, and we’re looking at how can the data we are developing help inform the space in general, not just ‘here’s what our customers are doing,’ but research that shows how this correlates to that in a situation,” said Elzinga. “The people science component is hugely important to us.”</p>
<p>“Organizations are living in a world of unprecedented change, and the last 12 months have only accelerated this,&#8221; TDM Growth Partners co-founder Hamish Corlett said in a statement about its investment in Culture Amp. &#8220;We have seen firsthand the power that Culture Amp’s unrivaled data set and unique insights have inside boardrooms globally, and we expect this only to amplify in the coming years.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exo, pronounced “echo,” is commercializing its handheld ultrasound device and point-of-care workflow platform, Exo Works.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.exo.inc/">Exo</a>, pronounced “echo,” raised a fresh cash infusion of $220 million in Series C financing aimed at commercializing its handheld ultrasound device and point-of-care workflow platform, Exo Works.</p>
<p>The round was led by RA Capital Management, while BlackRock, Sands Capital, Avidity Partners, Pura Vida Investments and prior investors joined in.</p>
<p>The new funding gives the Redwood City, California-based company over $320 million in total investments since the company was founded in 2015, Exo CEO Sandeep Akkaraju told TechCrunch. This includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/exo-raised-40-million-for-its-handheld-medical-imaging-device/">$40 million investment</a> raised in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ultrasound machines can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $250,000 for low-end technology and into the millions for high-end machines. Meanwhile, Exo’s device will be around the cost of a laptop.</p>
<p>“It is clear to us that ultrasound is the future — it is nonradiating and has no harmful side effects,” Akkaraju said. “We want to take the technology and put it in the palms of physicians. We also want to bring it down to the patient level. The beauty of having this window into the body is you can immediately see things.”</p>
<p>Using a combination of artificial intelligence, medical imaging and silicon technology, the device enables users to use it in a number of real-world medical environments like evaluating cardiology patients or scanning lungs of a COVID-19 patient. It can also be used by patients at home to provide real-time insight following a surgical procedure or to monitor a certain condition.</p>
<p>Exo then adds in its Exo Works, the workflow platform, that streamlines exam review, documentation and billing in under one minute.</p>
<p>Akkaraju said the immediate focus of the company is commercializing the device, which is where most of the new funding will go. He intends to also build out its informatics platform that is being piloted across the country and to ramp up both production and its sales force.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2019/10/point-of-care-ultrasound-market-2019-deep-analysis-of-current-trends-and-future-demand-by-top-key-players-are-analogic-canon-medical-systems-usa-inc-esaote-b-braun-medical-ge-healthcare.html">global point-of-care ultrasound market</a> is expected to reach $3.1 billion by 2025 and will grow 5% annually over that period. In addition to physicians, Akkaraju is hearing from other hospital workers that they, too, want to use the ultrasound device for some of their daily tasks like finding the right vein for an IV.</p>
<p>Once the company’s device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Exo will move forward with its plan to bring the handheld ultrasound device to market.</p>
<p>Zach Scheiner, principal with RA Capital Management, said he met the Exo team in 2020 and RA made its first investment in the Series B extension later that year.</p>
<p>He was “immediately compelled” by the technology and the opportunity to scale. Scheiner also got to know Akkaraju over the months as well as saw how Exo’s technology was improving.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an expanding opportunity in healthcare technology as it improves and costs go down,” he added. “The vision Sandeep has of democratizing the ultrasound is not a vision that was possible 15 or 20 years ago. We are seeing the market in its early stage, but we also recognize the potential. Every doctor should want one to see what they were not able to see before. As technology and biology improves, we are going to see this sector grow.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Businesses use Homebase to manage activities related to hourly workers, including payroll, shift scheduling, timeclocks and timesheets, hiring and onboarding, communication and HR compliance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium enterprises have become a big opportunity in the world of B2B technology in the last several years, and today a startup that&#8217;s building tools aimed at helping them manage their teams of workers is announcing some funding that underscores the state of that market.</p>
<p><a href="https://joinhomebase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which provides a platform that helps SMBs manage various services related to their hourly workforces, has closed $71 million in funding, a Series C that values the company between $500 million and $600 million, according to sources close to the startup.</p>
<p>The round has a number of big names in it that are as much a sign of how large VCs are valuing the SMB market right now as it is of the strategic interest of the individuals who are participating. GGV Capital is leading the round, with past backers Bain Capital Ventures, Baseline Ventures, Bedrock, Cowboy Ventures and Khosla Ventures also participating. Individuals include Focus Brands President Kat Cole; Jocelyn Mangan, a board member at Papa John&#8217;s and Chownow and former COO of Snag; former CFO of payroll and benefits company Gusto, Mike Dinsdale; Guild Education founder Rachel Carlson; star athletes Jrue and Lauren Holiday; and alright alright alright actor and famous everyman and future political candidate Matthew McConaughey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Homebase has raised $108 million to date.</p>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of strong growth for Homebase (which is not to be confused with the U.K./Irish <a href="https://www.homebase.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home improvement chain of the same name</a>, nor the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YC-backed Vietnamese proptech startup</a>).</p>
<p>The company now has some 100,000 small businesses, with 1 million employees in total, on its platform. Businesses use Homebase to manage all manner of activities related to workers that are paid hourly, including (most recently) payroll, as well as shift scheduling, timeclocks and timesheets, hiring and onboarding, communication and HR compliance.</p>
<p>John Waldmann, Homebase&#8217;s founder and CEO, said the funding will go toward both continuing to bring on more customers as well as expanding the list of services offered to them, which could include more features geared to frontline and service workers, as well as features for small businesses who might also have some &#8220;desk&#8221; workers who might still work hourly.</p>
<p>The common thread, Waldmann said, is not the exact nature of those jobs, but the fact that all of them, partly because of that hourly aspect, have been largely underserved by tech up to now.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;From the beginning, our mission was to help local businesses and their teams,&#8221; he said. Part of his inspiration came from people he knew: a childhood friend who owned an independent, expanding restaurant chain, and was going through the challenges of managing his teams there, carrying out most of his work on paper; and his sister, who<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> worked in hospitality, which didn’t look all that different from his restaurant friend&#8217;s challenges. She had to call in to see when she was working, writing her hours in a notebook to make sure she got paid accurately. </span></p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;There are a lot of tech companies focused on making work easier for folks that sit at computers or desks, but are building tools for these others,&#8221; Waldmann said. &#8220;In the world of work, the experience just looks different with technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homebase currently is focused on the North American market &#8212; there are some 5 million small businesses in the U.S. alone, and so there is a lot of opportunity there. The <a href="https://joinhomebase.com/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge pressure that many have experienced</a> in the last 16 months of COVID-19 living, leading some to shut down altogether, has also focused them on how to manage and carry out work much more efficiently and in a more organized way, ensuring you know where your staff is and that your staff knows what it should be doing at all times.</p>
<p>What will be interesting is to see what kinds of services Homebase adds to its platform over time: In a way, it&#8217;s a sign of how hourly wage workers are becoming a more sophisticated and salient aspect of the workforce, with their own unique demands. Payroll, which is now live in 27 states, also comes with pay advances, opening the door to other kinds of financial services for Homebase, for example.</p>
<p class="p5">“Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, with more than 60% of Americans employed by one of our 30 million small businesses. In a post-pandemic world, technology has never been more important to businesses of all sizes, including SMBs,” Jeff Richards, managing partner at GGV Capital and new Homebase board member, said in a statement. “The team at Homebase has worked tirelessly for years to bring technology to SMBs in a way that helps drive increased profitability, better hiring and growth. We’re thrilled to see Homebase playing such an important role in America’s small business recovery and thrilled to be part of the mission going forward.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s interesting to see McConaughey involved in this round, given that he&#8217;s most recently made a turn toward politics, with plans to run for governor of Texas in 2022. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Hardworking people who work in and run restaurants and local businesses are important to all of us,&#8221; he said in a statement. “They play an important role in giving our cities a sense of livelihood, identity and community. This is why I’ve invested in Homebase. Homebase brings small business operations into the modern age and helps folks across the country not only continue to work harder, but work smarter.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite their rich engineering talent, Blockchain entrepreneurs in the EU often struggle to find backing due to the dearth of large funds and investment expertise in the space. But a big move takes place at an EU level today, as the European Investment Fund makes a significant investment into a blockchain and digital assets venture fund.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fabric.vc/">Fabric Ventures</a>, a Luxembourg-based VC billed as backing the “Open Economy” has closed $130 million for its 2021 fund, $30 million of which is coming from the European Investment Fund (EIF). Other backers of the new fund include 33 founders, partners, and executives from Ethereum, (Transfer)Wise, PayPal, Square, Google, PayU, Ledger, Raisin, Ebury, PPRO, NEAR, Felix Capital, LocalGlobe, Earlybird, Accelerator Ventures, Aztec Protocol, Raisin, Aragon, Orchid, MySQL, Verifone, OpenOcean, Claret Capital, and more. </p>
<p>This makes it the first EIF-backed fund mandated to invest in digital assets and blockchain technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EIF Chief Executive Alain Godard said:  “We are very pleased to be partnering with Fabric Ventures to bring to the European market this fund specializing in Blockchain technologies… This partnership seeks to address the need [in Europe] and unlock financing opportunities for entrepreneurs active in the field of blockchain technologies &#8211; a field of particular strategic importance for the EU and our competitiveness on the global stage.”</p>
<p>The subtext here is that the EIF wants some exposure to these new, decentralized platforms, potentially as a bulwark against the centralized platforms coming out of the US and China.</p>
<p>And yes, while the price of Bitcoin has yo-yo’d, there is now $100 billion invested in the decentralized finance sector and $1.5 billion market in the NFT market. This technology is going nowhere.</p>
<p>Fabric hasn’t just come from nowhere, either. Various Fabric Ventures team members have been involved in Orchestream, the Honeycomb Project at Sun Microsystems, Tideway, RPX, Automic, Yoyo Wallet, and Orchid.</p>
<p>Richard Muirhead is Managing Partner, and is joined by partners Max Mersch and Anil Hansjee. Hansjee becomes General Partner after leaving PayPal’s Venture Fund, which he led for EMEA. The team has experience in token design, market infrastructure, and community governance.</p>
<p>The same team started the Firestartr fund in 2012, backing Tray.io, Verse, Railsbank, Wagestream, Bitstamp, and others.</p>
<p>Muirhead said: “It is now well acknowledged that there is a need for a web that is user-owned and, consequently, more human-centric. There are astonishing people crafting this digital fabric for the benefit of all. We are excited to support those people with our latest fund.”</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch Muirhead added: “The thing to note here is that there&#8217;s a recognition at European Commission level, that this area is one of geopolitical significance for the EU bloc. On the one hand, you have the ‘wild west’ approach of North America, and, arguably, on the other is the surveillance state of the Chinese Communist Party.”</p>
<p>He said: “The European Commission, I think, believes that there is a third way for the individual, and to use this new wave of technology for the individual. Also for businesses. So we can have networks and marketplaces of individuals sharing their data for their own benefit, and businesses in supply chains sharing data for their own mutual benefits. So that&#8217;s the driving view.”</p>
