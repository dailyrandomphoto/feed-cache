										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York Times Company agreed to purchase sports media outlet The Athletic in a deal valued at $550 million, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nyt-to-buy-the-athletic-for-550-million">reports</a>.</p>
<p>This deal comes after months of speculation &#8212; at one point, The Athletic CEO Alex Mather approached Axios about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-startups-axios-and-the-athletic-discuss-merger-eyeing-spac-deal-11616756401">a merger</a>, which did not come to fruition. With this deal, the company seeks to bolster its subscription business &#8212; The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/business/media/nyt-new-york-times-earnings-q2-2021.html">surpassed</a> 8 million subscriptions last year and is on track to surpass its goal to <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/at-the-new-york-times-10-million-paid-digital-subscribers-is-no-longer-an-ambitious-enough-goal/">grow to 10 million</a> subscribers by 2025.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, The Athletic had 1.2 million subscribers as of November, who pay about $72 per year. But on its own, The Athletic isn&#8217;t yet profitable, and didn&#8217;t plan to be until 2023 &#8212; it employs 600 staff and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-athletic-burned-through-95-million-between-2019-and-2020">spent almost $100 million</a> between 2019 and 2020, though it only brought in around $73 in the same time period.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With $550M the NYT could have just subsribed to The Athletic for 46 million years.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The New York Times&#8217; acquisition of The Athletic is consistent with recent trends in media, where many outlets are consolidation. Recently, BuzzFeed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">acquired</a> Complex and HuffPost before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/">going public</a>, for example. But media workers are skeptical of these changing tides &#8212; after BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost, for example, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/media/huffpost-layoffs/index.html">laid off</a> 47 of 190 HuffPost employees and closed the entire HuffPost Canada arm, impacting 23 more employees. At the onset of the pandemic, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/504227-new-york-times-lays-off-68-staffers-primarily-from-ad-division">both The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-layoffs-pay-cuts-fa15a80d-47b7-46a5-a08f-3e7eba558f30.html">The Athletic laid off</a> employees as well, as did many media companies.</p>
<p>More media workers are seeking out union agreements to protect them from sudden layoffs and paycuts, which were a constant threat in the industry even before the onset of the pandemic. Some journalists have taken an even more radical approach &#8212; in late 2019, Deadspin&#8217;s <a href="https://defector.com/how-we-got-here/">entire staff</a> quit the site due to frustrations with management and started Defector, a worker-owned media company. In its <a href="https://defector.com/defector-annual-report-year-one/">first year</a>, Defector earned $3.2 million in revenue, which accounted for its $3 million in operating expenses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a much smaller deal than its acquisition of The Athletic, The New York Times purchased Wirecutter, a product reviews site, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/business/media/new-york-times-company-buys-the-wirecutter.html">$30 million in 2016</a>. But there has been significant tension between Wirecutter and its parent company in recent months &#8212; after two years of slow-paced union contract negotiations, Wirecutter staff <a href="https://defector.com/today-is-a-good-day-to-not-read-wirecutter/">went on strike</a> for five consecutive days, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, after management failed to reach an agreement with them before Thanksgiving. Then, the Wirecutter Union filed an unfair labor practices <a href="https://defector.com/wirecutter-union-files-labor-grievance-after-vindictive-new-york-times-withheld-holiday-pay/">complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board after The New York Times withheld their pay while on strike. By December 14, the union, represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/nyguild">The NewsGuild of New York</a>, reached a deal with the New York Times, ensuring increased pay and improved working conditions. But the New York Times is still facing scrutiny for <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTGuildTech/status/1478789680518807556">anti-union behavior</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hey </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-kpws4y r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/TheAthletic">@TheAthletic</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">, we’d love you to meet our friend </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-kpws4y r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/nyguild">@nyguild</a>,&#8221; the Wirecutter Union tweeted after the news broke.</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on how subscriptions to The Athletic will change, or how staff at the publication will be impacted by the acquisition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2019, Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/amazon-sidewalk-is-a-new-long-range-wireless-network-for-your-stuff/">announced</a> its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b/?node=21328123011">Sidewalk network</a>, a new low-bandwidth, long-distance wireless protocol and network for connecting smart devices &#8212; and keeping them online when your own WiFi network, for example, goes down, by piggybacking on your neighbor&#8217;s network. Since last year, Amazon has been turning its Echo devices into Sidewalk bridges and select Ring and Tile devices can now access the network. Now, Amazon is launching its first professional-grade Sidewalk device meant to cover large areas like a university campus or park.</p>
<p>The full name for the new device is a mouthful: the Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro by Ring. It could be installed inside but is mostly meant to be set up outside &#8212; and ideally on a high spot &#8212; and can cover hundreds of devices up to five miles away (depending on the local circumstances, of course).</p>
<p>To test the devices, Amazon partnered with Arizona State University, which will install these new Sidewalk bridges on light poles on its Tempe campus. The University Technology Office plans to use it as a proof-of-concept with plans to connect sunlight and temperature sensors, CO2 detectors and particle counters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Amazon is also partnering with <a href="https://thingy.us/">Thingy</a>, an IoT company that specializes in environmental monitoring, to install its air quality monitoring tools to alert first responders of potential wildfires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro brings us the power of [Long Range] in a massive number of needed locations, easy integration with our existing applications in AWS, and trusted security for the devices and applications. We are very excited to work with Amazon Sidewalk to measure air quality and wildfires with our sensors and help solve the connectivity challenges for these critical applications,&#8221; said Scott Waller, CEO and co-founder of Thingy.</p>
<p>But beyond the device itself, it&#8217;s the fact that Amazon continues to invest in the Sidewalk ecosystem that&#8217;s most important here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a network, we&#8217;re enabling actors to help the IoT industry,&#8221; Stefano Landi, the director of <span class="il">Amazon</span> <span class="il">Sidewalk, told me. &#8220;</span>At the end of the day, if we want to drive the proliferation of smart and connected devices everywhere, you need to have the right network. If you talk to IoT developers today, yes, there are many options, but either it&#8217;s very expensive, from a connectivity perspective vs. cellular, or the range is limited, or it&#8217;s draining the battery, or it&#8217;s just that the overall development cycle is too complex. So we felt that we should invest and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done and we continue to invest in enabling these networks so that the IoT community can build any type of application: consumer, enterprise, public sector. &#8221;</p>
<p>Landi noted that only a few months after launching the network, the company now has very strong residential coverage in more than 100 major U.S. metro areas. In part, of course, that&#8217;s because there are a lot of Echo devices in America&#8217;s homes and unless users opt out, most modern Echo smart speakers now have Sidewalk enabled by default. Not everybody is comfortable with that, though Amazon would argue that it designed its network to be privacy-first and that it won&#8217;t use a lot of bandwidth (it&#8217;s mostly for passing alerts, not your Ring camera&#8217;s video feed, after all). But it&#8217;s a fair guess that most users aren&#8217;t even aware of Sidewalk to begin with.</p>
<p>Covering a residential area is one thing, though. With the Sidewalk Bridge Pro, businesses can now also cover entire swaths of land to connect their sensors. There seems to be some demand for this, because Landi noted that &#8220;more than a few thousand companies&#8221; have already reached out to Amazon to ask about commercial use cases &#8212; mostly in connection with AWS IoT, the company&#8217;s cloud-based managed IoT service. A lot of this interest, Landis said, is coming from companies that want to build public sector solutions, mostly around smart city services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sidewalk Bridge Pro is a professional-grade bridge that is exactly tailored to be deployed outside of those [residential areas],&#8221; explained Landis. &#8220;So that now you have coverage pretty much everywhere. Think about commercial centers, parks, city parks, state parks, municipal parks, wildness areas, commercial area, and so on. Now you really bring that ubiquitous connectivity, so when you&#8217;re there, building a solution, you know that coverage is going to be pretty much anywhere that you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis noted that while he expects most users to install the bridge outdoors, it can also used indoors to cover a warehouse or a large store. And even though it&#8217;s explicitly called the &#8216;Pro,&#8221; we shouldn&#8217;t expect the company to launch a consumer-style &#8220;non-pro&#8221; version anytime soon. That&#8217;s what the Echo and Ring devices are for, after all.</p>

<p>First off let&#8217;s upgrade these dinky twin 27-inch Dells I&#8217;ve been attempting to work on for the last couple years. They&#8217;re flat — lifeless! And the bezels between them?

<p>Samsung knows what&#8217;s up: one giant 55-inch monitor curved like a snow shovel. <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-together-for-tomorrow-vision-at-ces-2022">The Odyssey Ark</a> is an experiment in next-gen media, meant for you to be streaming, gaming, and video chatting all at the same time on the same screen.

So when your Warthog gets naded, you don&#8217;t just feel it in your pride, you actually fall over as your chair bounces you up and out. Well, maybe you won&#8217;t fall, but if you&#8217;re streaming it&#8217;ll get a laugh., so lean into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to work while I play, though, so I need a keyboard that matches the quality of my writing. Writing really starts from the <em>keys</em>, as I&#8217;ve always said. Why do you think all the old-style authors had those great chunky typewriters? Can&#8217;t write cool characters if you don&#8217;t look cool doing it. I&#8217;m not sure how Neal Stephenson gets around that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254214" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254214" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg" alt="A Keychron keyboard seen from above." width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg 1720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=1536,685 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keychron</p></div></p>
<p>But every writing style is different, and you should build your keyboard from the ground up and with a good foundation. That&#8217;s Keychron&#8217;s Q1 for you: solid as hell, and you can assemble it yourself with a bunch of different styles of keycaps and switches on tap. Why not have WASD in gaming linear but the rest in clicky tactile? Well, probably because it&#8217;ll feel weird, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>(Joking aside, I actually have one of these to test and it&#8217;s pretty nice. A good mechanical keyboard is a perfectly practical way to upgrade your own WFH setup.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that keyboard plugged into? Glad you asked. See, I&#8217;ve come to understand that heat management is at the core of PC performance, but at the same time good insulation is at the core of a quiet rig. How can I have both, though? And don&#8217;t say liquid cooling! That&#8217;s just crazy. No, I&#8217;m going with the most elaborate solution possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/page/ces-2022/">The Kinetic series from CyberPowerPC</a> uses a complex set of folding triangles to produce variable airflow across the face of the case, opening and closing as heat requirements change. Why triangles? Why this origami style and not just some valves? Why such a complex arrangement doomed to get clogged with dust? Hello, because it looks awesome.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. How will people see all my important swag when I&#8217;m on a video call? First of all, thanks for your concern, I appreciate it. You&#8217;re a kind person. But I thought of that too. Check out my new Zoom setup:</p>

<p>Right?!</p>
<p>Not only will they see my whole tasteful computing nook, but also how I&#8217;m&#8230; definitely fully dressed in a professional clothes during the workday. Okay, maybe I can angle it so&#8230; well, I&#8217;ll figure it out. Anyway, this huge telepresence rig <a href="https://lavitre.fr/en-us">comes from French company la Vitre</a>, which advertises it as &#8220;an 86-inch experience.&#8221; It&#8217;s actually got a bunch of other cool stuff built in too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I need to make sure I&#8217;ve got the freshest ping in the lobby or people will think when I dodge their shots it&#8217;s all down to packet loss. TP-Link has the final word with its <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-axe200-omni/">Archer AXE200 Omni robotic router</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254232" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/roborouter.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254232" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/roborouter.gif" alt="Animation of a router automatically moving its antennas." width="640" height="527" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TP-Link</p></div></p>
<p>No more getting up and going to the router to tweak your antenna configuration. Wait&#8230; you don&#8217;t do that? No wonder you aren&#8217;t climbing the leaderboard, my friend. Signal goblins. Just wait for this thing to come out and it&#8217;ll take care of everything for you. After the robocalypse, every one of the hunter-killers will cold sport one of these bad boys.</p>
<p>Right, there&#8217;s my big upgrade. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have all the pieces here in person some time in the next decade or so.</p>

		Alvaro Gutierrez is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.barkibu.com/">Barkibu</a>, which uses data to make pet care better, more affordable and personalized. Alvaro began his career providing acquisition financing for M&amp;A at JP Morgan before co-founding Spanish pet retail giant Kiwoko, which in turn acquired 12 other companies and was eventually sold 5x.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When startup founders think of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), we tend to think of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;-esque processes, involving dramatic office reshuffling and expensive rebranding. The reality though, is that M&amp;A isn&#8217;t limited to flashy corporate businesses nor does it have to bulldoze through company culture.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of 2021, of 530 startup acquisitions, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/acquisitions-data-dive/ec8fb95f-f099-4c43-b856-81ddc3e84feb/acquisitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> were startups buying other startups. More early-stage businesses are climbing aboard the M&amp;A train to take advantage of fellow startups&#8217; tech, talent and to absorb competitors. They&#8217;ve also realized that deals don&#8217;t have to have heavy price tags and red tape that larger companies navigate.</p>
<p>I know this firsthand from 15 years buying and selling companies. I previously worked at JP Morgan, facilitating M&amp;A for corporate banks, and I&#8217;ve taken what I&#8217;ve learned to the startup space. I conducted 12 acquisitions at my retail platform Kiwoko, which helped it grow to over €150 million in revenue, and it was eventually sold five times.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is particularly beneficial for startups that struggle to scale operationally because they essentially buy cash flow, revenue and other companies&#8217; traffic, meaning startups grab a bigger share of their markets. They&#8217;re also a good way for startups to find, consolidate and experiment with their value proposition. The problem though, is that most founders don&#8217;t know how to get started with M&amp;A and resign themselves to the shadows of bigger players. But mergers are accessible and advantageous to businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The human side of M&amp;A is always the hardest to get right.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These are my three insider tips for startup M&amp;A:</p>
<h2>Let your in-house team get the ball rolling</h2>
<p>M&amp;A naturally comes with some friction and cost, but unlike corporates, startups don&#8217;t need to outsource people to smooth out the steps. You don&#8217;t need investment banks, advisers, legal teams and consulting firms to ensure all goes well.</p>
<p>Founders can run business and financial checks with the support of in-house resources like the accounting department and lawyers, as well as leverage their network and do due diligence through trusted connections. Granted, you have to spend a lot of time and focus in this vetting stage, but it is possible and effective without bringing new players in.</p>
<p>Beyond the logistics, founders need to actively analyze the value of the targeted company. For example, every one of the acquisitions I have made — even with significantly smaller companies — had better purchasing terms with at least one supplier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2251537&amp;preview=true">ridiculing one mosquito-fighting product</a>, I figured it&#8217;d be only right to highlight another piece of buzz-reducing tech that was showing off its products at CES this year. <a href="https://www.mosqitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosqitter</a> is an industrial-scale mosquito murdering machine that attracts female mosquitos before they get a chance to lay eggs. From there, it&#8217;s a short zap away from dispatching them with great aplomb.</p>
<p>The company explains that there are four natural components that mosquitoes are lured to before they launch into their vampiric, blood-sucking ways: The CO<sub>2</sub> from breathing, the heat signatures from our bodies, UV light at a specific wave-length that mammals emit and scent. Mosqitter&#8217;s product uses all four to attract the creatures, in various cycles to maximize its allure. The company explains its product is designed to work in all weather conditions. It can be operated remotely through an app, and can run 24/7 by adding an optional set of solar panels.</p>
<p>Once the mosquitos have been courted into the machine, they are killed without the use of poisons.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251945" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mosqitter imitates a living being, which attracts female mosquitoes, and pulls them into the device. The results can be seen from day one. Two-three weeks later, the mosquitoes&#8217; breeding cycle will be disrupted and the territory will be free of mosquitoes,&#8221; the company&#8217;s COO, Olga Diachuk explains, before clarifying that the machine doesn&#8217;t kill the mosquitos directly &#8211; it has a net that keeps them trapped, where they starve to death and/or dry out.</p>
<p>The company originally started sales in 2020, and claims it has sold more than 250 units. It is hoping to start scaling up manufacturing in the local areas where the machines will be most needed, including Italy, India and Zimbabwe. Perhaps most impressively, the company has accomplished all of this on a shoestring budget. Since being founded in 2019, the company has been operating from $85,000 worth of grants from the <a href="https://usf.com.ua/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian Startup Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.crdfglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRDF Global</a>, and a $100,000 angel check, in addition to its revenue generated from product sales.</p>
<p>Mosquitter currently has three different versions of its product on the market &#8211; the smallest, for home use, costs $950. A business-focused version costs $1,150, and there&#8217;s a large-scale version available for $2,100, which is focused on parks, local municipalities, and larger areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a journalist and investor, I&#8217;m always a little suspicious of single-product, super-niche companies; there are just so many things that can go wrong, and one of the ways that direct-to-consumer brands do well is having the ability to cross-sell to its customers. <a href="https://us.morphee.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morphée</a> was one of those brands, starting with its frankly ludicrously over-designed (but stunningly beautiful) <a href="https://us.morphee.co/products/morphee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$99 non-digital sleep and meditation product</a>. It added <a href="https://us.morphee.co/products/my-little-morphee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a product for kids</a>, and at CES, it launched the Morphée Zen, a smaller, travel-focused relaxation pebble.</p>
<p>The Zen is an ultra-portable &#8220;pebble&#8221; that offers mental wellness training and sleep-focused relaxation sessions, including soothing sounds, music and voice therapies. It has 72 audio sessions based on six themes, including dynamic relaxation, deep relaxation, and breathing techniques. There&#8217;s a bunch of nature sounds, relaxing music and quick two-minute &#8220;instant relief&#8221; sessions to get your heart rate down to a more manageable rate.</p>
<p>Of course, the real question here is whether Morphée is trying to stretch its brand just a little bit too far. Taking the smartphone devices away from kids with the My Little Morphée might make sense and the original Morphée is a piece of art as much as a meditation device.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Zen makes a lot less sense to me, in a world where $69.99 a year buys you a <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> subscription, and there&#8217;s an almost infinite supply of meditations, sleep sounds and focus music available from Spotify, YouTube and, well, pretty much everywhere else you can imagine. Do we really need another product that will &#8212; sooner or later &#8212; end up in a landfill somewhere, when a purely software solution would accomplish essentially the same thing?</p>
<p>The product will be available in Q3 2022, priced at $79.99</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flittleotterhealth.com&amp;esheet=52557905&amp;newsitemid=20220106005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Little+Otter&amp;index=1&amp;md5=bd8bb23f7b6ba756f95c4e37aa5a0d10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Otter</a>, a digital mental health company that aims to provide tools and treatment for both children and their families, has raised $22 million in Series A funding. The round was oversubscribed and led by CRV, with participation from Torch Capital, Vast Ventures, Hinsdale, Boxgroup, Able, Carrie Penner Walton, G9, Springbank Collective and angel investors. This latest investment brings Little Otter&#8217;s total funding to $26.75 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded in May 2020 by mother-daughter duo Rebecca Egger and Dr. Helen Egger based on the idea that the children&#8217;s mental health crisis can only be addressed by treating the whole family through accessible and scalable precision technology. Since its launch, the company has seen 45% month-over-month growth.</p>
<p>Once a family signs up on the platform, they&#8217;re given a quick questionnaire that aims to understand their needs. From there, the family receives a personalized report and gets matched with a personal care lead who will review the assessment answers together to discuss the family&#8217;s unique needs. The care lead will then define the next steps and create a care plan for the family. Every family then starts their mental health journey by setting goals and milestones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254495" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In terms of the new funding, Little Otter says the investment will fuel growth and allow it to offer its platform in more states. Little Otter is currently available in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, with plans for the platform to be available nationally by 2023.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be investing heavily in building our state-of-the-art tech and data platform,&#8221; Little Otter CEO Rebecca Egger told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;We are bringing on Jim Inoue as our chief technology officer to oversee Little Otter’s technical growth and scale. He will play a pivotal role as we build a new way of identifying and treating early childhood mental health, incorporating data, proprietary assessment methods, and data visualization in the platform. Additionally, we’re working to become an in-network benefit covered by insurance plans and employers and will be in all 50 states by 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Otter’s platform is based on co-founder Dr. Helen Egger’s clinical expertise and provides virtual, on-demand and integrated care with parenting specialists, early childhood-trained therapists, couples therapists and pediatric psychiatrists. The company says it aims to break down existing barriers to services and bring expert mental healthcare to all. Little Otter says 85% of families using its care plans have reached clinical improvements within just six sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future of the platform, Rebecca Egger says the company wants Little Otter to be the personalized mental health companion for every family.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a massive amount of need for mental health resources in this country but a one-size-fits-all solution will not work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are building Little Otter to be the go-to resource for all families and the long-term partner that helps families meet their mental health goals and thrive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV charging companies have been showing their wares at CES for years now. But this year, the stakes — and opportunities — are a bit higher.</p>
<p>With dozens of electric passenger cars and commercial fleets expected to hit the market in just a few years, EVs are pushing into the mainstream. That larger market comes with a price: Mainstream consumers expect charge times that are akin to gas refueling times, are accustomed to good user experience design and probably haven&#8217;t ever had to think about peak and off-peak energy grid hours.</p>
<p>Charging companies and smaller startups that showed up at CES this year seemed cognizant of that shift and pitched products that were faster, more connected, easier to use, easy to install and built to work with the electrical grid. The takeaway: EV charging companies, keen to reach this bigger customer base, revealed products designed to hit just about every use case, from commercial fleet charging to at-home charging, from vehicle-to-grid tech to monetizing advertising space on chargers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">global EV charger market expected to grow from $3.23 billion in 2020 to nearly $11 billion in 2025</a>, the industry still has space for new entrants before it consolidates around a few giants, many of whom did not grace CES with demos or news. The smaller companies that showed off tech at CES are standing out with unique solutions, lots of connectivity and upgraded charge speeds.</p>
<h2>Blink Charging</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blink came to play, with four new charging products this year, including one DC-fast wall-mounted charger and three Level 2 chargers &#8212; one designed for fleet and multiunit applications, another for home applications and the last for integrating advertising displays. All of the chargers come with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as smart capabilities that allow for things like fleet management integration, load sharing technology and energy use management. </span></p>
<h3>Blink MQ 200 for fleet EV charging stations</h3>
<p>Specifically designed for fleets, workplace and multifamily locations, this 50 amp charger comes with Plug &amp; Charge functionality, which can automatically identify vehicles through the unique and encryption flow of information from the vehicle to the charging station. As its name suggests, this means drivers will simply have to plug in to begin a charging session.</p>
<p>The MQ 200, which will be available by the end of Q1 this year, comes with Smart Grid functionality for direct utility communications and local load management across two or more chargers, which allows for the installation of two to 20 chargers on a single circuit, ideal for overnight fleet charging. It also communicates with the Blink Network, software that connects Blink chargers to the cloud, as well as the Blink Fleet <span style="font-weight: 400;">Management </span>Portal, which was also launched at CES. The portal gives fleet managers a dashboard to track charging and load management, chargers, vehicles and drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Blink HQ 200, next-gen home charging</h3>
<p>The HQ 200 is Blink&#8217;s updated residential charger, a Level 2 charger with 50 amps, up from last generation&#8217;s 30 amps. The extra power at home, as we&#8217;ll see with other EV charging companies, is a trend this year as companies race to find ways to decrease charge time.</p>
<p>While customers can choose to go for a basic charger with no bells and whistles, the smart, Wi-Fi-enabled version is really the one that intrigues us. The HQ 200 is one of Blink&#8217;s first chargers to come with vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G), which allows EVs to charge during off-peak hours and give back to the grid from energy stored in the EV battery during peak hours when there&#8217;s high demand.</p>
<p>The HQ 200 also connects to the Blink Mobile App to instantly start a charge, schedule charging times and set reminders. It will be available by the end of Q1 this year.</p>
<p><strong>DC Fast wall-mounted for two cars at once</strong></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall 50 kW can be wall-mounted or set up on a pedestal, and it can charge two cars at once, which makes it ideal for fleet, retail and streetside charging and high-traffic locations. It has up to 150 amps of output and V2G tech, a 10-inch touchscreen display and the ability to bill for charges based on time, kWh or per session. It also allows for remote management and energy usage reports via the Blink Network, and an RFID reader allows for users with a member card, RFID credit card or mobile app to start a charge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price point will also make it attractive for locations that otherwise may not feel they can afford DC fast,&#8221; a Blink spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;The DC Wall 50 kW costs less than $20,000, while existing equipment today typically starts at $35,000.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Vision IQ 200 for advertising</h3>
<p>This Level 2 charger comes with one or two 30-inch LCD screens for dynamic digital media displays, allowing for full-service advertising capabilities &#8212;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ideal for retail, hospitality, municipal and high-traffic locations. Property hosts will be offered revenue share opportunities for both charging and advertising income, the latter of which will be managed through a third-party vendor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vision IQ 200 is equipped with one or two 80-amp IQ 200 chargers, and it features easy payment via RFID, Apple Pay, Google Wallet and all major credit cards, as well as other smart functionalities like remote management and real-time energy usage reports. </span></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall will be available later this year, said Blink.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">E-Lift</span></h2>
<p>E-Lift came to CES to introduce its new customizable GS Pop-Up charging station, which the Dutch company hopes to launch in North America soon. The little station comes with up to four plugs for simultaneous charging, and it can be equipped with sensors that link to E-Lift&#8217;s Sustainable and Smart Energy Management System (SENSE).</p>
<p>The SENSE platform is a management system for users&#8217; mobility and energy needs. Customers can log in remotely to monitor and manage their mobility and energy-consumption data, &#8220;resulting in a cost-effective energy transformation that is beneficial for governments and companies looking to reshape their future with the use of renewable energy resources,&#8221;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/e-lift-to-announce-new-smart-and-sustainable-pop-up-charging-station-at-ces-2022-301451922.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the company said in a statement</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">JuiceBar</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JuiceBar, a Connecticut-based EV charging company that’s really playing the Made in America card, unveiled its first residential charger at CES &#8212; the Cheetah, aptly named for being quick, so the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which says it will credit $1,000 for every old charger that is exchanged for one of its new chargers, will be selling its Cheetahs sometime in 2022. JuiceBar has hundreds of commercial chargers, both public and private, across the U.S. and Canada, the same markets that will see the new at-home charger. </span></p>
<p>The Cheetah will be available in 16, 32, 40 and 48-amp configurations <span style="font-weight: 400;">and 120, 208 and 240 input voltages</span>, which after seeing what Blink is putting out, doesn&#8217;t make JuiceBar the fastest Level 2 on the market, but it&#8217;s close. The Cheetah also has Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and cloud connectivity, which helps for Smart Grid charging. It has a 25-foot cord with an optional tangle-free cord retractor.</p>
<p>For peace of mind when charging at home, the Cheetah also is built with dual safety relays, which allows the second relay to open and break the circuit in the event that the first closes and fuses shut. The charger&#8217;s power is backed by 100% certified carbon reduction projects that offset the carbon footprint of the charger, according to JuiceBar. The company is buying carbon offsets for the first year. After that, buyers can continue to purchase carbon offsets on a subscription basis of less than $1 per week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cheetah will be available for consumers in late Q2 or early Q3, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. They&#8217;ll initially be sold through third parties such as auto dealers, house builders and utility companies in the U.S. and Canada. </span></p>
<h2>Wallbox</h2>
<p>Wallbox introduced its Quasar 2 at CES this year, the latest generation of its bidirectional home charger. This one not only allows EV owners to charge and discharge their EV to power their home or the grid, but it also allows owners to isolate their home from the grid and use their EV for backup power during a blackout, even if it&#8217;s caused by a natural disaster. Wallbox says its Quasar 2 can power a home for more than three days during a blackout.</p>
<p>The vehicle-to-home (V2H) functionality should help EV owners save money on home energy costs, says the company, particularly in states where power rates are related to demand. Users can schedule charging sessions to happen when rates are low, and those who have solar power installations can store excess energy in their EV during low usage periods.</p>
<p>The Quasar 2 provides 48 amps of power, comes with CCS compatibility for rapid-charging vehicles like the Jaguar I-Pace or BMW i3 and connects to the myWallbox app through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet or 4G.</p>
<p>Wallbox didn&#8217;t share how much the Quasar 2 would cost, but said it would be comparable to Quasar 1, which costs about $4,000. It plans to launch by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Meredot</h2>
<p>Electric cars aren&#8217;t the only vehicles hitting the market. Micromobility vehicles need some love, too. That&#8217;s why Meredot unveiled its first commercial Wireless Charger designed for e-scooters, e-mopeds and other vehicles like food delivery robots and wheelchairs. The charger takes the shape of a physical pad that can either be placed above or below ground, and it charges vehicles that have been equipped with a receiver when they are parked on top of it.</p>
<p>Meredot is targeting micromobility OEMs and fleet operators for its Wireless Charger. It&#8217;s ready to go to market and license its tech to companies that want to offer a novel and potentially hassle-free way of giving vehicles a charge. For micromobility fleets in particular, charging scooters and bikes, even when they have swappable batteries, is one of the major cost-suckers, so this kind of tech could potentially be a game changer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Meredot Wireless Charger delivers a new, distributed architecture that helps achieve greater site capital efficiency and scalability, saving energy and costs,&#8221; said Roman Bysko, CEO and co-founder of Meredot, in a statement. &#8220;The Meredot Wireless Charger can become an infrastructural foundation to a new micromobility charging experience benefitting both operators and riders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims its tech can charge 50% more e-scooters on the same surface compared to traditional cable charging systems, which can lead to serious savings for charging sites. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mosquitos <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/world-deadliest-animal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill more people</a> than any other creature in the world, and there&#8217;s no shortage of potential tech solutions. One such solution comes from <a href="https://bzigo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bzigo</a>, which markets a device that finds mosquitos in your home, points at them with a laser and can notify you on your phone when a mozzy is buzzing about.</p>
<p>Walking the halls at CES, I often find the odd company where I have to push my cynicism down deep. It turns out that &#8220;walking&#8221; those halls virtually &#8212; after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/google-cancels-ces-show-presence-amid-omicron-concerns/">TechCrunch announced</a> that we are not attending in person &#8212; doesn&#8217;t shield your friendly correspondent from the odd moment of &#8220;wait, what?&#8221; in the context of a trade show. In this case, the magic of pointing at a mosquito with a laser pointer is a super neat tech challenge, and I can absolutely see how this could be the first step along a path toward productizing an autonomous mosquito eliminator.</p>
<p>The device itself consists of a light source (infrared LED), a hi-res wide camera and enough electronic brains crammed into the little package to do the rest. The AI built into the device can, according to the company, tell the difference between man&#8217;s worst friend and a speck of dust, by analyzing the movement patterns of the would-be pest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251537" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I could let all of this excitement slide in the (virtual) hustle-bustle of a CES show floor, but there are two issues.</p>
<p>The first issue is that &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/mosqitter">unlike other products we saw at CES</a> &#8212;  the device doesn&#8217;t actually do anything to eliminate the insects, it merely sends a notification to your phone that it&#8217;s time to dust off your nerf gun (or whatever your favorite mosquito-dispensing method might be), and points at the little flying good-for-nothing with a little red laser pointer. The company assured me that it&#8217;s a Class 1 &#8220;absolutely safe&#8221; laser. I can see why the company chose to do that &#8212; I can&#8217;t imagine the legal and health risks involved with a laser that&#8217;s powerful enough to actually zap the skeeters to whence they came. But that also introduces a fundamental question about this product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locating the mosquito is the real challenge; killing the mosquito is the easy part,&#8221; says Benjamin Resnick, product manager at Bzigo, as he refers to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHOECBFpy04" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoHOECBFpy04&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640705788215000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0W4VjsAkCjUrSEU9eiRbLL">demonstration video</a>. &#8220;Once Bzigo uses its laser pointer to show you where it lands, you can easily kill the mosquito yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit, as someone who grew up in a country where the mosquitos are the size of small propeller planes, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve ever had that particular challenge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second &#8212; and much more troubling &#8212; issue with the product is that the company is planning to ship what they have so far as a consumer-facing product. Bzigo claims that thousands of customers have reserved orders for the $199 device, with a product launch and delivery to pre-order customers coming up &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>My most heart-felt kudos to any marketing team at any company that can sell thousands of $199 mosquito-marking laser pointers, but in the grand scheme of things, it is essentially a useless product. Mosquitos are crepuscular (i.e. they feed at dawn and dusk) &#8212; when people are least likely to be awake to hunt for mosquitos. And there&#8217;s already a spectacularly efficient solution out there: Long-lasting, insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are a simple, cost-effective solution to protect families from malaria while they sleep. <a href="https://nothingbutnets.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They cost $10, fully delivered</a>, and create a physical barrier against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and the insecticide woven into the nets kills the mosquitoes before they can transmit the disease from one person to the next.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m as big a nerd as the next guy, and I love a good science experiment or creative prototype. My question: Does the economic and environmental impact of shipping thousands of fancy laser pointers around the world &#8212; which will invariably all find their way to landfills in the next 10 years, without having killed a single mosquito or saved a single life &#8212; really outweigh the benefits?</p>
<p>I look forward to a version of this product that has some sort of mosquito-murdering tech on it. Until that happens, I hope that the founders re-think their plan of shipping this prototype as a consumer product. There are so many real problems out there worth solving; putting on a late-night silent rave laser light show for a couple of mosquitos ain&#8217;t it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://linedock.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Line</a> is a regular staple at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES</a>, showing off its high-end milled-aluminium docking stations. This year, the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">back in Las Vegas</a> with an accessory aimed squarely at the gamers among us. Line Frzr is a thermoelectric active cooling device that pre-cools the air before it goes into your gaming laptop.</p>
<p>Traditional laptop cooling solutions might increase airflow into the laptop, but Line&#8217;s solution takes that strategy a couple of steps further. The Line Frzr cools the air from room temperature to mid-winter frost that a freezer would be proud of, -5°F (or -15°C), before injecting the freezing cold air into the laptop. The theory is that this keeps the computer&#8217;s CPU and GPU much cooler, enabling them to run cooler, and therefore at a higher clock speed with greater performance, for longer.</p>
<p>The cool-looking tech is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thermoelectric cooling</a>, but instead of bonding the Peltier elements directly to the processors (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2NQ1lq4ZM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is a well-documented <em>awful</em> idea</a>), Line&#8217;s team came up with a different approach &#8212; pre-cooling the air with a pair of little cooling towers, and blasting it into the laptop from there. The design relies on the most common design architecture for gaming laptops, the company tells me. The battery lives underneath the keyboard, and the laptop is lifted up on little feet for maximum air circulation, typically with two air-thirsty fans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253435" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Electronic components have recommended operating temperatures; the same goes for thermal paste on CPU/GPU, and most importantly the battery,&#8221; explains Nancy de Fays, co-founder at Line, explaining why blasting the laptop with sub-zero temperature air won&#8217;t harm it. &#8220;The Line Frzr does not freeze the entire laptop: it blasts sub-zero temperature air into the laptop air intake. Said air then flows into the fan and finally through the heatsink radiator; laptop fans are rated at subzero temperatures, and on top of that, the system is regulated by infrared sensors monitoring the laptop temperature. When the GPU/CPU drops below 50°C, the system stops cooling.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254255" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254255" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254255" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6368.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254255" class="wp-caption-text">The Line Frzr prototype at CES. The holes are designed to align with the air intakes on a gaming laptop &#8212; and the little three-pointed star is the temperature sensor. <strong>Image:</strong> Line, Inc.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We blow the air into the fans, not into the electronics of the laptop. The Frzr itself isn&#8217;t meant to be portable &#8212; it is meant to add a huge amount of extra cooling to your gaming laptop when you&#8217;re playing at home, and you can harness the power of a real desktop computer,&#8221; explains Quentin Malgaud, CEO and co-founder at Line, Inc. &#8220;We actually started working on this concept when we were <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/linedock#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on the original Indiegogo campaign</a> [in 2017], but we put it on the back burner because it wasn&#8217;t efficient enough to be battery powered. In our tests on this bad boy [Malgaud is gesturing at the technical prototype at the company&#8217;s CES booth], we saw an up to 25% CPU score improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to create a gaming look, which is why our design has these little cooling towers,&#8221; de Fays explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I was mildly skeptical as to whether this product is a good idea in the first place. As a layperson, rapidly heating and cooling components that have different thermal properties could cause issues. The company assures me that my worries are unfounded, however, preventing any issues by using the infrared thermostat system that monitors the temperature of the laptop placed on top of Frzr. This automatically activates cooling if and when required, without the need to install drivers. The device takes care of the cooling independently by averaging data from the temperature sensors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254256" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254256" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_6374.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254256" class="wp-caption-text">Line demonstrated how well its cooling system works on its functional prototype &#8212; in this case, cooling the air surfaces to -13.5°C (7.7°F). <strong>Image:</strong> Line, Inc.</p></div></p>
<p>The company has a patent on the IR sensors that observe the laptop&#8217;s temperature, and it has a slew of additional patents in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The product does not have an official price tag yet, but Malgaud suggests that end-users should expect a sub-$300 price tag, and that the company is hoping to get the price down to under $200 by the time the production version is finalized. The company is expecting to start shipping it to eager semi-mobile gamers in October this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, now with more than 800 million people listing their professional profiles to build out their careers, is taking its next steps to get them to spend more time on the platform. The company is rolling out a new events platform, where it will be listing, hosting and marketing interactive, virtual live events. It is starting out first with an audio-only product that it will be launching this month in beta, followed by a video version that it will launch in the spring, initially targeting Creators that use LinkedIn as organizers and hosts.</p>
<p>With virtual events finding a lot of traction in the last couple of years of pandemic life, the plan for now is for LinkedIn&#8217;s new events product to be an all-virtual offering, and to open up the format to be shaped by those running the events themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our philosophy is to put the organizers in control,&#8221; said product manager Jake Poses in an interview. &#8220;We want to make it easier to host virtual round tables, fireside chats, and more. Some may want the event to be more formal, or less formal. Some might want to communicate with their audience, to open up to the floor. We&#8217;re giving professionals interactivity and support.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the audio event feature it is launching this month sounds familiar, it is: this is the Clubhouse rival that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> LinkedIn was working on back in March 2021. LinkedIn has over the last year been experimenting with other features that it might add to this events service, such as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/linkedin-is-testing-a-new-paid-ticketed-events-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid, ticketed option</a> that it started testing in September last year &#8212; although for now, Poses confirmed that interactive events are being launched as a free service, with no plans for ticketing at this point.</p>
<p>(LinkedIn should probably not wait too long to introduce ticketing&#8230; I asked, and a Clubhouse spokesperson confirmed to me, that the startup is, as &#8220;part of [its] creator-first mantra&#8221;, Clubhouse is &#8220;exploring multiple options to allow creators to further monetize their work which includes ticketed events,&#8221; but with no timeframe specified. She also confirmed that video is not on the roadmap for now: &#8220;The company remains focused on social audio experiences, and is continuing to explore how new audio-centric features can enhance that experience for the community,&#8221; she added.)</p>
<p>A mock-up of how the audio event will look is here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2254487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Audio-Event-Desktop-Overlay-Mode.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="477" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When it launches later this month, the new events platform will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end, with no need to use any other third-party software: hosts will be able to record and run the event straight from LinkedIn, and it will feature tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and to moderate discussions; and for attendees to communicate to each other both during and after events take place. LinkedIn will also, naturally, list events and help get the word out about them across its platform.</p>
<p>As for who will be hosting these events, the platform initially will be targeting individuals who are already using LinkedIn to connect with wider audiences &#8212; its own stable of Creators, as you might get on other social platforms like TikTok, except these are building content aimed at career development, professional topics and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has been working on cultivating a wider and more active Creator community in the last several months. To this end, it even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $25 million fund and incubator</a> last autumn, and Poses said that there are now 1.5 million Creators using LinkedIn Live, the broadcast product. Creating and hosting events is a natural fit to extend that strategy.</p>
<p>Poses added that over time LinkedIn also hopes to get businesses and bigger organizations to build events on LinkedIn. With the bigger organizations, however, often come bigger budgets, more infrastructure aimed at higher production values, and potentially ticketing and other services. He said the idea will be that those who need or want to will be able to integrate third-party apps and software into the production mix. (Indeed, he also confirmed that for now the whole stack has been built at LinkedIn itself &#8212; rather than leaning on any video or other software from Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.)</p>
<p>A mock-up of how the video feature might appear in the feed is here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2254486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png 2311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=1536,1077 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=2048,1436 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s interest in doing more in events goes back some way, starting with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/linkedin-gets-physical-debuts-new-events-hub-for-people-to-plan-in-person-networking-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Events hub that it first debuted in 2019</a>, before the days of the pandemic and with a focus on in-person get-togethers. Some months into the COVID-19 pandemic, LinkedIn formalized some of the ways that it was being used in more virtual events scenarios with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/linkedin-ads-polls-and-live-video-based-events-in-a-focus-on-more-virtual-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of online polls and broadcast-style video events</a> aimed at virtual engagement.</p>
<p>Those have been doing well for the company. Poses noted that annual virtual event creation has grown by 150% over the last year, and it has seen a 231% increase in LinkedIn Live virtual event attendees in the same period. The topics covered have included<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/leadingconversationsinai-extend6844345029847195648/"> AI innovations</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6853718457247113216/">opening keynotes</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739706686547783681/"> financial planning</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739916123795468288/"> live home installations</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739976627914063872/">mentorship</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739221625050304513/">cybersecurity</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6874794673030987776/">award ceremonies</a>. (These also point to how LinkedIn longer term may well have more than just individual creators running these events.)</p>
<p>LinkedIn has also been using its size and financial muscle to invest in and acquire other interesting companies working in the events space. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005239/en/Hopin-Announces-LinkedIn-as-Latest-Strategic-Investor-and-Partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last June, LinkedIn disclosed</a> that it was investing in virtual events juggernaut Hopin — which was<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> valued at $7.75 billion</a> in its most recent funding round in August 2021. Last August, it also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-us-jumprope-jake-poses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a startup called Jumprope, which let creators make and share how-to and other mentoring videos. (In fact that is how Poses came to join the company and lead product covering creators, events and video.)</p>
<p>All of this is not only the next logical step for LinkedIn in its own content strategy, but it also definitely feels like a sign of the times, given how, two years into the pandemic, many of us are still working from home, and Covid-19 remains a threat to many.</p>
<p>Still, you can&#8217;t help but wonder how and if LinkedIn will be impacted by the fatigue that has set in for a lot of us around virtual videoconferencing and frankly virtual everything, and if LinkedIn could adjust if it turns out that one more virtual events option, is one too many.</p>
<p>Poses&#8217; answer to this is both to defend virtual events as a must-have for more democratization, but that some event creators might also choose to take a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>Virtual and hybrid may be &#8220;the future&#8221;, Poses said, but interactive events are setting out to fix something completely different.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as I could remember, I have gone to talks and meetups. These are the mainstays of how professionals communicate and learn things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they require money, time to travel, courage to go into a room and speak, and space to run an event. Our belief is that moving from in person to virtual is actually democratizing and opening up access to many more people.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave.com hopes to join SoFi in the ranks of the fintech startups that did just fine in their SPAC debuts. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom did not play out as some folks in the technology and business worlds hoped. Despite a wave of optimism through early 2021, private companies that pursued public debuts with the help of blank-check companies have frequently failed to cover themselves in glory in the intervening quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more, a wave of SPACs failed to take a market-changing number of unicorns and other high-priced private companies public; the number of private unicorns continues to grow more quickly than even a SPAC-juiced public market has been able to receive them.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not shaking up the dynamics of the unicorn market doesn’t mean that blank-check companies have had no impact on the startup market. The list of SPAC casualties is lengthy. Latch, to pick one particular tech shop </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/for-unicorns-how-much-does-the-route-to-going-public-really-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that TechCrunch spoke to concerning its SPAC process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has seen its share price fall from an all-time high of $19.70 to just $6.56 today.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also seen SPAC deals announced or completed with companies of imperfect repute. But not every company going public via a SPAC is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an EV company with an issue telling the truth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a social networking &#8220;company&#8221; of a former president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> famous for sporting a lack of connection to reality. SoFi is perhaps a good example of a company that went public with the help of a blank-check company that appears to be doing just fine.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-06/spotify-introduces-call-to-action-cards-for-podcast-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> a new ad format aimed at podcasters which it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Call-to-Action Cards&#8221; &#8212; or CTA cards, for short. The feature, which is powered by Spotify&#8217;s streaming ad insertion technology, will display a visual ad in the Spotify app when the audio ad begins to play. The cards can be customized by advertisers with their own images, text and other clickable buttons that direct listeners to &#8220;shop now&#8221; or take some other action the advertiser is hoping to encourage.</p>
<p>While the ads are capable of capturing users&#8217; attention while streaming, Spotify knows that listening to podcasts is often an activity where the app is running in the background while the user is doing something else &#8212; like going for a walk, exercising at the gym, doing housework, driving and more. That&#8217;s why Spotify is also making the new CTA cards available on both the podcast&#8217;s show and episode pages. This allows the targeted listeners to interact with the ad at some later point when they&#8217;re browsing through the Spotify app, the company explains. These cards will remain available for up to seven days after the listener has heard the ad, or less if the campaign wraps before that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254448" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254448" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254448" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the future, Spotify believes the format will evolve to do more than simply direct users to a landing page of some kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think about these cards as an important step towards modernizing the format &#8212; a format that will become more capable over time, as we add shoppable and video and other interactive features into them,&#8221; said Jay Richman, Spotify&#8217;s head of Ads Business &amp; Platform, when introducing the format during a press briefing as a part of the company&#8217;s virtual participation at this week&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>Advertisers who adopt the format will also have access to reporting and measurement based on confirmed ad impressions made possible through streaming ad insertion.</p>
<p>Spotify has heavily invested in the streaming ad insertion technology, which brought real-time targeting and reporting to podcasts. Before, when podcasts were delivered through the more open RSS format, they were also hampered by the technical limitations that came with being downloadable content only. Ads were embedded, not dynamically inserted, into shows. And the audio players couldn&#8217;t differentiate between which part of the program was the show&#8217;s content and which part was the ad &#8212; it was all one single file. With streaming audio insertion, the content itself is paused, the ad is inserted and then the content resumes after the ad completes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this takes place in real time &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t prevent the listener from skipping past the ads as they had before, if they don&#8217;t enjoy hearing the message.</p>
<p>In 2020, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquired the podcast hosting and ad company Megaphone</a> for $235 million to help scale streaming ad insertion beyond its own shows to reach publishing partners through the Spotify Audience Network &#8212; a network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/spotifys-podcast-creation-tool-anchor-gains-access-to-the-companys-larger-audio-ad-network/">now includes shows from independent creators</a> using Spotify&#8217;s Anchor platform. And just last month, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/spotify-acquires-podcast-tech-company-whooshkaa-which-turns-radio-broadcasts-into-on-demand-audio/">acquired podcast tech company Whooshkaa</a> to bring the technology to radio broadcasters who want to release their audio content as podcasts after first airing it on the radio.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254460" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254460" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ulta-Beauty-CTA.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Because streaming ad insertion already knows when the ad appears in the program, Spotify can then pop up the accompanying CTA card as well to display the advertiser&#8217;s creative. For listeners, the experience may be a better one for seeking out the products and services they heard the host promoting during the program, as they&#8217;ll no longer have to try to remember a URL or a coupon code the creator had spoken.</p>
<p>However, the addition also makes using Spotify to stream podcasts feel even more like an ad-supported experience than before, as even Premium (paying) subscribers will be subject to the new, arguably distracting ads and will see them appear on both podcast show and episode pages even after they&#8217;ve finished listening.</p>
<p>Spotify tested the new CTA cards with select advertisers, including Ulta Beauty, ahead of today&#8217;s launch. According to Ulta&#8217;s head of Content, Social, &amp; Integrated Marketing, Christine White, the company reached around 250,000 unique Spotify listeners with one of its campaigns and around half of those saw at least one CTA card after hearing the audio message, including those who saw the card later while browsing the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify sees the CTA cards as another step toward making podcast content more interactive. The company is already experimenting in this area through features like voice commands and podcast audience polls and Q&amp;As, which engage listeners in real time &#8212; making them more likely to return to the app while the podcast is playing, too. More recently, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/">been expanding access to video podcasts</a>, via Spotify&#8217;s Anchor platform. Podcaster creators can add a video to their podcast to show themselves recording the show or they can use the functionality to add the occasional graphic, chart or slide. This feature is now rolling out to more creators and listeners, said Anchor co-founder and Spotify&#8217;s head of Talk, Mike Mignano, during the same briefing.</p>
<p>Spotify notes that no incremental work will be required by creators to enable the new CTA cards, which will initially be available across select Spotify Original &amp; Exclusive podcasts in the U.S., starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rupifi has raised $25 million in a new financing round as the Indian startup, which currently provides buy now, pay later service to several marketplaces to serve their merchants, looks to expand its business-to-business payments offerings.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Bessemer Venture Partners co-led the two-year-old startup’s $25 million financing round. Existing investors Quona Capital and Ankur Capital also participated in the round, a top executive said Thursday.</p>
<p>The new investment, especially from high-profile global investors, shows the appetite many have for the buy now, pay later space, a category that has made deep inroads globally in recent years, and their bullishness on young firms in India.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.rupifi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rupifi</a> works with more than two dozen business-to-business marketplaces, including Walmart, Flipkart and Jumbotail to serve their merchant partners, many of whom are mom and pop shop operators, with credit (working capital). The ticket size of these checks range from ₹10,000 ($135) to ₹10,000,00 ($13,500).</p>
<p>The startup sifts through the partner marketplace’s data for its underwriting &#8212; on who should get a credit and its size. Rupifi, which largely works with non-banking financial companies to source the capital, has provided credit to more than 50,000 sellers so far, Anubhav Jain, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Our B2B BNPL is currently operating at some of the category-leading B2B marketplaces in India across sectors such as FMCG, pharma, fashion, electronics, agriculture and food,” he said.</p>
<p>Access to capital is the biggest challenge merchants face in the world&#8217;s second most populous nation. Small businesses, especially mom and pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for buying their next batch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254472" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254472" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254472 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="206" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=150,31 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=300,62 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=768,158 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=680,140 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254472" class="wp-caption-text">The workflow of Rupifi&#8217;s BNPL service. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rupifi</p></div></p>
<p>A timely shot of working capital enables these merchants, who otherwise run some of the world’s most economically sound businesses, to significantly boost their revenues, several industry figures have shown.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later is Rupifi’s marquee offering today, but Jain, who previously worked at American Express and Razorpay, and sold his edtech platform StudyBud in an all-cash deal, said that the startup will be expanding its product offerings in the next few months.</p>
<p>“What we are saying is that BNPL is just one of the payment instruments that the merchants are using,” he said. The startup is now building an embedded checkout product &#8212; which, like its BNPL offering, will sit within the partner firm’s app and website &#8212; and will power any payment option, including cash to process the payment. “The goal is now to move to B2B payments and checkout.”</p>
<p>&#8220;B2B payments and B2B credit are large problems with technology being the future to solve these and Rupifi team is building around that keeping the SMEs at the core,&#8221; said Vishal Gupta, managing director of Bessemer Venture Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>Another product it has started trialing is a commercial card. Jain said the card is aimed at small businesses and enterprises that has exceedingly demonstrated good behavior with our BNPL service. &#8220;They can use the card at any place, even if we are not integrated with that business,&#8221; said Jain.</p>
<p>“We have had the experience of working with more than a hundred B2B and SaaS founders,&#8221; said John Curtius from Tiger Global in a statement. &#8220;We understand that globally B2B payments are broken and largely manual. In the $1 trillion B2B commerce and payments space in India, Rupifi has demonstrated rapid growth and proven product leadership.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software businesses are setting new heights for fundraising nearly every day. Transmit Security <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/525-million-a-round-transmit-security-passwords-insight-2021-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke records</a> last summer with their $543 million Series A, and in Q3 2021, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2021-na-startup-funding-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$26.4 billion was invested in North American</a> early-stage startups, compared with $12.1 billion a year earlier. There have been warnings that these landmark fundraises are driven by too much capital available and a highly competitive venture market.</p>
<p>However, despite the twofold growth in dollars invested, the number of companies receiving funding has grown by less than 30% compared with Q3 2020. Furthermore, <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-financial-operating-benchmarks-report#.YZZxV9nMITU">recent benchmarks data</a> shows that the businesses garnering these high valuations in 2021 exhibit metrics that significantly outperform their peers from 2018-2020. Simply put, 2021 has seen startups raise the bar for what a good company looks like, and investors have been willing to pay a high price for a piece of the pie.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<p>Recent benchmark data shows that qualifying for the top quartiles in key SaaS metrics was harder in 2021 than ever before, particularly when you consider the growth and net dollar retention metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>From 2018-2020, growing at 140% would put business in the top quartile as a Series A company — growth expectations have risen to +193% in 2021.</li>
<li>Beyond growth, formerly impressive metrics like 110% net dollar retention no longer make the cut — to be considered one of the best businesses raising a Series B, +125% NDR is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a closer look at each of these early rounds highlights that investors might not be going crazy with their recent investments as startups redefine what &#8220;good&#8221; looks like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mine&#8217;d, a <a href="https://www.doyoumined.com/">digital platform</a> and wellness network that connects consumers with emotional health experts and community, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by Listen Ventures. The round was also funded by WNDRCO and Able Partners, Joyance Partners, Route 66 Ventures as well as angel investors Ed Baker, the former vice president of growth at Facebook and Uber, and Jillionaire from Major Lazer. Mine&#8217;d features interactive and short-form live and on-demand classes to users based on a wide range of topics, including dating, breakups, career and purpose. Since launching six months ago, Mine&#8217;d has built a community of over 100,000 users and one million videos.</p>
<p>The platform was co-founded by wellness-tech entrepreneur Aaron Albert and emotional wellness content creator <a href="http://www.instagram.com/createthelove">Mark Groves</a>. Albert, who is now the company&#8217;s CEO, says the idea for Mine&#8217;d was prompted by his experience with trying to find support after a breakup. He says he found traditional therapy to be expensive and time-consuming, while modern solutions like teletherapy lacked in their quality of care. <span style="font-weight: 400;">A friend of his who knew he was having a hard time sent him one of Mark Groves&#8217; wellness videos. Albert says he was immediately taken with Groves&#8217; content and reached out to him, after which the pair began working together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started to explain all of the challenges I faced as a consumer wanted to get emotional support and he expressed to me all of the challenges he faced as a creator of emotional wellness content, not feeling like there was a safe space for his peers amidst the creator economy explosion,&#8221; Albert told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was very clear there was a real opportunity here, and so Mine’d was born.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once users join Mine&#8217;d, <span style="font-weight: 400;">they&#8217;re asked to select the areas they want to improve on. Users are then shown a selection of experts where they can see what areas they specialize in and browse content before choosing who to follow. Users are able to join live sessions where they can ask experts questions and get or give support to the community.</span></p>
<p>In terms of the new funding, Albert says Mine&#8217;d plans to use it to bring on an additional 100-200 experts to the platform. Mine&#8217;d currently has 20 wellness experts, including marriage and family therapist Vienna Pharaon, marriage, family and relationship expert Dr. Alexandra Solomon and sex therapist Shadeen Francis. The company also plans to launch creator tools that will allow its experts to offer more support to their community. Mine&#8217;d also aims to focus on email marketing and content production. Lastly, the company plans to use the funding to launch exclusive Mine&#8217;d courses within the app.</p>
<p>When asked what sets Mine&#8217;d apart from other wellness apps, Groves said other platforms are focused on how to scale one-on-one therapy, coaching and group therapy. Although Mine&#8217;d believe in those methods, Groves believes that by the time someone goes to therapy, it&#8217;s very late in their personal growth journey.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to meet people, with curated and incredible content, at step one, the frictionless space where people are beginning to search for answers to their problems, challenges and making sense of their feelings,&#8221; Groves stated. &#8220;W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e wanted to create a space where they could be themselves, be curious, be vulnerable, and decide on the depth of intimacy that they are comfortable with given their familiarity with personal growth, therapy, and consuming content that is sometimes challenging and emotional.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future, the company plans to continue developing Mine&#8217;d in a way that still feels personal and vulnerable. Groves outlined that Mine&#8217;d will help its experts<span style="font-weight: 400;"> reach the people who need support while allowing them the ability to get paid for their expertise. In addition, Albert said the company also plans to expand its offerings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking to become the unifier in the emotional wellness space,&#8221; Albert said. &#8220;We want to give our community the chance to not only get help through our many content offerings, but ultimately be able to book 1:1 and small group coaching. We are planning to launch a Mine’d Coaching Certification, allowing people to step into their calling and become coaches themselves.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Verb’s customer-facing analytics tools are built specifically to live inside multi-tenant SaaS applications.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after its public launch, <a href="https://www.verbdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verb Data</a>, a customer-facing analytics company, took in $3 million in funding to continue developing technology so that SaaS companies can build better in-product dashboards for their customers.</p>
<p>Founders Dave Hurt and Oleg Fridman started the Boston-based company in January 2020 and started its private beta program with five customers in August 2020, then launched to the public in April 2021.</p>
<p>Verb’s customer-facing analytics tools are built specifically to live inside multi-tenant SaaS applications, CEO Hurt told TechCrunch via email. What makes it different from competitors is the way it makes simpler the process of building and maintaining customer-facing dashboards by non-technical team members by reporting and automating the data infrastructure that supports those data experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For example, every chart that is built and embedded into a customer’s application is backed by a data warehouse that is specifically optimized for that chart without requiring any developer effort,” he added. “This allows software teams to focus on their core product while also providing their end-users with high-performing analytics dashboards.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round was led by El Cap Holdings and lead investors Stew Bradley and Kunal Tandon. Individual investors also participating include Stan Garber, Alex Yakubovich, Matt MacInnis, Steve Garrity and Packy McCormick.</p>
<p>The company counts dozens of companies as customers, including Encamp, BidOps, SwipeBy and ReviveMedia. Hurt attributes Verb’s flexibility for enabling customers to use the tools in a way that is unique to their needs.</p>
<p>Some are using it for embedded product dashboards, some are using it inside of Notion as a client analytics portal and others use Verb for customer success management or as a sales tool.</p>
<p>“Verb has allowed us to supercharge our efforts around both internal and customer reporting,” Ben Leiken, CTO at Bid Ops, a predictive sourcing software company, said via email. “Thanks to their powerful features, we’re able to instantly deploy changes and test new features with customers — all without needing to wait for our next release.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to be one of the &#8216;haves&#8217; of SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/how-to-be-one-of-the-haves-of-saas/embed/#?secret=xINGyYi8zY" data-secret="xINGyYi8zY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to this new funding, Verb Data raised an undisclosed pre-seed round in 2020 that helped it complete its private beta and get to the public launch, Hurt said. He plans to invest in building out the company’s engineering team and on product development. Verb has 15 employees, up from seven at this time last year.</p>
<p>Some of the features coming down the pipeline in the first quarter include map data and charts for greater flexibility and use with Verb’s modularized drag-and-drop editor. Users will also be able to visualize their data on maps on existing dashboards to allow for better reporting.</p>
<p>In addition, Verb is working on additional data source integrations from existing partners, an updated design styles library and Slack integration for quicker and easier communication when a dashboard is created, Hurt said.</p>
<p>Hurt said the company was focused on customer growth over revenue, so he did not have year over year metrics to share, but did say that over the past six months, Verb had 65 new signups with an overall conversion rate of 20%. In July that rate increased to 30%. The company intends to raise another round of funding in the third quarter of 2023 and expects to have 100 paying customers by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“The SaaS market is becoming more vertical-specific, which means that companies are competing on core functionality in their respective niche,” Hurt said. “While this generally means that end-customers are benefiting from software that more closely aligns with their needs, it also means that product teams have to focus on their core functionality to keep up with competition, making the analytics dashboard an even more difficult feature to prioritize on the roadmap.”</p>

		Pete Buttigieg currently serves as the 19th Secretary of Transportation, having been sworn in on February 3, 2021.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Millennia ago, some unnamed innovator created humanity’s most famous early invention: the wheel. And ever since, the story of transportation has been one of human creativity, innovation, and technology. From e-scooters to spacecraft, technology shapes most human journeys, whether it’s a historic spaceflight or a daily cross-town commute.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Department of Transportation, my colleagues and I think every day about how transportation technologies are evolving, and we use our policy tools to support these innovations and make sure they deliver convenience, safety, and economic opportunity for the American people.</p>
<p>At any time in history, and certainly in ours, innovation shapes and reshapes how people and goods move to where they need to be. But in recent years, “innovation” has become such a buzzword that it risks losing its meaning—and policymakers risk losing our focus as we contend with the constantly shifting and rapidly developing world of transportation technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As policymakers, we must prioritize. We need to assess which important innovations will develop on their own, and which require federal support for basic research. We must consider when a technology should be given as much room as possible to develop experimentally, and when it raises concerns that require regulation to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The current decade is especially full of challenges and opportunities from developments in transportation technology. We are witnessing the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, the widespread adoption of recreational and commercial drones, renewed attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, increasingly routine commercial space travel, and, perhaps most urgently, the high-stakes race to dramatically reduce transportation’s impact on our climate before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Amid these changes, the role of public policy is not always obvious, but it’s always important. To inform our work, today our department is establishing a set of six guiding principles for our work on innovation in transportation.</p>
<p>Innovation is not an end in itself, but a chance to improve. Our innovation efforts should serve our most important public policy goals, like creating economic opportunity, advancing equitable access to transportation, and helping to confront the climate crisis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovation should be shaped in ways that help America win the 21st century, with transportation systems and infrastructure that make communities more competitive, adaptable, and resilient.</p>
<p>Our innovation strategy must support workers, knowing that our choices will help to define whether any given technological development meets its potential to create economic benefits for all.</p>
<p>A good innovation strategy allows for experimentation and learns from setbacks, because these are indispensable parts of the scientific method that underpin all invention and discovery.</p>
<p>Our approach to innovation should center on opportunities to collaborate, recognizing the distinct but related roles of the public, private, and academic sectors.</p>
<p>And finally, our policies should be flexible and adapt as technology changes, because we can’t prepare for an evolving future with policy that only makes sense under present or past conditions.</p>
<p>These principles will help us to ensure that the enormous potential of U.S. transportation innovation benefits our nation and its people. To some, “government” and “innovation” are not words that go together naturally. But in reality, the public sector has always played a vital role in unlocking the innovative capacity of the American people.</p>
<p>Consider the smartphone, an invention that transformed the way we live in a matter of just a few years. Smartphones could only be the result of private-sector inventions and marketing—the natural role of private companies, not government departments. But the technologies on which smartphones depend—like microprocessors, lithium batteries, touchscreens, GPS, and indeed the internet itself—were all supported or invented by government researchers.</p>
<p>Some of our largest tech companies—including Google, Apple, and Tesla—benefited from government subsidies, loan guarantees, or other public support early in their growth.</p>
<p>And while government is far from the source of all invention, it does have a responsibility to help ensure that all inventions are safe and practical for the public.</p>
<p>Government didn’t invent planes, trains, or automobiles, but it did build airports, lay tracks, and construct highways. It enacted laws requiring seat belts and air bags, and created an air traffic control system so that people could travel safely.</p>
<p>As secretary of Transportation, I’ve had the privilege of seeing firsthand the latest frontiers of transportation innovation in our country.</p>
<p>In Georgia last year, I saw the nation’s first-ever solar roadway, which provides clean power for nearby electric vehicle (EV) chargers. In Oregon, I test-drove one of the electric buses that cities around the country are embracing as cleaner and quieter alternatives to outdated diesel vehicles. And in North Carolina, I visited an advanced research lab working on an extremely important, if unglamorous, subject: the future of pavement, including more durable asphalt and even materials that can recycle carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>American companies and scientists are at work every day pushing the boundaries of what is possible in transportation. And our department is at work every day supporting basic research and maintaining the guardrails that ensure those technologies unfold in ways that are safe, equitable, and clean. In the years ahead, these core principles will guide that work—and thanks to President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have new resources to support those efforts.</p>
<p>These investments will help more Americans adopt electric vehicles and save money on fuel. They will help more children take the bus to school without being exposed to toxic fumes. And they will put more people to work creating the infrastructure of the future.</p>
<p>When it comes to transportation innovation, perhaps the hardest thing to predict is the timing of how and when these developments will impact our everyday lives. Less than 60 years passed between the first flight at Kitty Hawk and the first crewed American spaceflight. Less than 10 years after the first smartphones hit the market, ride-sharing was overtaking taxi use in many American cities. Electric vehicles were in commercial production in 1902 at Studebaker factories in my hometown of South Bend, Indiana—only to all but disappear for most of the 20th century, then re-emerge as a dominant force in the 21st.</p>
<p>It’s not the job of policymakers to guess or dictate how and when these advancements will unfold. But our role in supporting, fostering, and safeguarding the work of transportation innovation is vital, and it comes at an exceptionally important time in the story of American transportation. The decade ahead will bring countless transformative changes in how people and goods move around the country and the world. And the Department of Transportation will be here to help support those innovations and ensure they benefit us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before has the importance of a smooth-flowing supply chain been as clear as it has been in the COVID-19 pandemic era. For manufacturers in particular, managing intricate supply chains can be particularly challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.assentcompliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent Compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a Canadian company focused on supply chain sustainability management. Put more simply, Ottawa-based Assent aims to help manufacturers make smarter decisions regarding “who they do business with and how their products are sourced,” notes CEO Andrew Waitman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is announcing it has raised $350 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Vista Equity Partners. The financing follows a $131 million Series C raise led by Warburg Pincus, which remains the company’s largest shareholder.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254258" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Assent was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life &#8212; from 2010 to 2015. In the subsequent years, after Waitman came on as CEO, the company has raised over $500 million and grew its headcount from about 20 to 820 today (45% of which identify as female). While half a billion dollars raised in the U.S. is not uncommon, it’s a bit more rare in the Canadian tech scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s trajectory continues to grow and Waitman projects the SaaS company will cross $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) this year after growing ARR by over 50% in the past 12 months. Its customers include the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GE Appliances, Polaris, Stryker and Escatec.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company delivers enterprise-wide supply chain sustainability solutions across product compliance, trade compliance and ESG &#8212; better known as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental, Social and (Corporate) Governance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Assent has made a name for itself by being exclusively focused on complex manufacturing. Doubling down on that niche has allowed it to build what it claims is “the industry&#8217;s largest network of supplier intelligence.” Specifically, it works to help complex manufacturers proactively identify and manage risk, accelerate market access and growth and promote brand reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s compliance platform provides centralized access to supply chain data for use by teams across a given company. It automates data collection and validation and provides &#8220;configurable&#8221; reporting so that its customers “can stay ahead” of their data requirements.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The increasing complexity and scale of regulations and varying requirements globally, combined with a heightened focus on ESG, presents challenges for companies across industries, particularly for manufacturers,” Waitman said. “Assent enables deep insight and rapid transparency to help ensure products are made with environmental and human rights standards necessary to compete — and win — in markets of the future.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to continue expanding in Europe, eventually enter the Asian market and grow its headcount by 40% across its sales, services, engineering, customer success and marketing teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Manufacturing represents 20% of GDP,” Waitman told TechCrunch. “It’s an enormous market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vista’s Foundation Fund, which invests in middle-market companies seeking to scale and accelerate their growth trajectory, led the investment. Vista’s Patrick Severson, co-head of the Vista Foundation Fund, and Jake Hodgman, managing director of the Foundation Fund, will join the Assent board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies globally are facing increased demand to ensure they source their components and raw materials in an ethical and responsible manner, either from government regulators who oversee them or from customers and partners whose expectations hold them to higher standards, noted Severson. Assent is “ahead of the curve” when it comes to solving enterprise supply chain challenges through technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s solution empowers companies to mitigate their brand and reputation risk and become better corporate citizens,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severson added. “The scrutiny being placed on complex manufacturers in how they manage their supply chains is only increasing. Assent is uniquely positioned to be a clear leader in a future focused on manufacturers adopting supply chain sustainability best practices.” </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Popcorn Time, the app that was once popular for making pirating movies as easy as watching Netflix, has <a href="https://popcorn-time.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">shut down</a>. Its original developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-15-torrent-front-end-popcorn-time-made-streaming-movies-free-and-ea.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">took the service down</a> and abandoned the project merely a few days after it launched in 2014. But since the project was open source, other developers were able pick up where they left off, and it&#8217;s been killed and revived a few more times ever since. It remains to be seen whether Popcorn Time is now gone for good, but it looks like the biggest contributor to its most recent demise is the dwindling interest in the app.</p>
<p>On its website, the developers posted a graph of &#8220;popcorn time&#8221; searches over the past seven years. While the app enjoyed a ton of searches in the months after its launch in 2015, the graph shows a sharp decline in interest by 2016. Its popularity continued to wane, and it never really recovered after that, at least based on Google Trends.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/popcorn-time-alternative-is-hard-to-find-as-app-shuts-down?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the group behind Popcorn Time announced its closure in an email. While they didn&#8217;t say whether law enforcement action was a factor behind their decision to shut down the app this time around, Popcorn Time has had brushes with the law in the past. The original version may have closed after authorities got involved, and Hollywood studios even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-popcorn-time-hollywood-lawsuit.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">sued individual users</a> who allegedly downloaded and shared copies of movies illegally.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Developers associated with Popcorn Time previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-20-popcorn-time-p2p.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">talked about</a> how they&#8217;re not responsible for piracy themselves, because the service doesn&#8217;t actually host any content. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer sharing system and only provided a way for users to access content hosted on other people&#8217;s computers.</p>
