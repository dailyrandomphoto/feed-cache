										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online advertising can be a &#8220;pretty dry topic,&#8221; as Facebook&#8217;s head of brand marketing Andrew Stirk acknowledged, but with a new campaign of its own, the social networking giant is looking to &#8220;bring to life how personalized ads level the playing field&#8221; for small businesses.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/lets-talk-about-why-personalized-ads-matter/">Good Ideas Deserve To Be Found campaign</a> will include TV, radio and digital advertising. Individual businesses will also be able to promote it using a new Instagram sticker and the #DeserveToBeFound hashtag on Facebook.</p>
<p>The campaign will highlight specific small businesses on Facebook, including bag and luggage company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/houseoftakura/">House of Takura</a>, whose founder Annette Njau spoke about the benefits of digital advertising at a press event yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What those platforms allow us to do is, they allow us to tell stories,&#8221; Njau said. &#8220;I can’t tell this story on TV, I can’t tell this story in a huge magazine because it costs money and I don’t know who will see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>These sentiments are similar to a campaign that Facebook launched last year in opposition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature</a>, where apps will have to ask for permission before sharing user data for third-party ad targeting. In response, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">Facebook claimed</a> that it was &#8220;standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,&#8221; though the social network also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2/">pointed to these changes</a> as one of the &#8220;more significant advertising headwinds&#8221; that it expects to face this year. (Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook, in contrast, has said that these changes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">provide consumers with the control that they&#8217;ve been asking for</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rd7bbfvu3I"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/embed/#?secret=Rd7bbfvu3I" data-secret="Rd7bbfvu3I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When asked how this fits into the broader dispute with Apple, Stirk said that while Facebook has been publicly opposed to Apple&#8217;s changes, this campaign is part the company&#8217;s longer-term support for small business.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a degree of urgency in the fact that &#8230; small businesses are hurting right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Head of Facebook Business Products Helen Ma added that this is &#8220;very much an extension of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/facebook-and-instagram-ad-new-features-to-help-you-find-and-support-local-businesses/">the work that we did on the product side</a> at the very start of the COVID period,&#8221; which included the launch of the Businesses Nearby section and a #SupportSmallBusiness hashtag.</p>
<p>In addition to launching the campaign today, Facebook is announcing several product changes, including a simplified Ads Manager dashboard, new options for restaurants to provide more information about their dining experiences and more information about personalized ads in Facebook&#8217;s Business Resource hub and Instagram&#8217;s Professional Dashboard.</p>
<p>The company also said it will continue to waive fees on transactions through Checkouts on Shops through June 2021, and will do the same for fees collected on paid online events until August 2021 at the earliest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year or so, voice transcription startup <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> doubled down on the future of remote work by integrating its product with meeting apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/a-i-powered-transcription-service-otter-ai-can-now-record-from-google-meet/">Google Meet</a>. With the COVID-19 pandemic having sent so many to work from home, those investments have paid off &#8212; the company has transcribed over 100 million meetings with more than 3 billion minutes, and has seen an 8x increase in revenues during 2020. Now, Otter.ai is announcing its next steps, fueled by a new $50 million Series B round of investment.</p>
<p>The new round was led by <a href="https://www.spectrumequity.com/">Spectrum Equity</a>, with participation from existing investors Horizons Ventures, Draper Associates, GGV Ventures, Draper Dragon Fund, and others. The $50 million figure also includes a $10 million convertible note, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/a-i-powered-voice-transcription-app-otter-raises-10m-including-from-new-strategic-investor-ntt-docomo/">announced last year.</a></p>
<p>Otter.ai&#8217;s service offers an easy way to record meetings, whether in-person through an app on your phone, or online through its integrations with popular web conferencing apps. But it&#8217;s the latter that really came into play over the course of 2020, when suddenly entire workforces were sent home from the office and forced into endless Zoom calls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With convenient timing, Otter.ai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">added Zoom integration</a> back in April 2020 &#8212; the early days of the pandemic. It has now become the most popular platform for Otter.ai&#8217;s web conferencing users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think with the pandemic, we&#8217;ve seen a huge shift in consumer behavior &#8212; especially in meeting behavior and education behavior, which are two key use cases for Otter,&#8221; says Otter.ai CMO Kurt Apen. &#8220;You see a lot of teams that are using Otter in the business and you see a lot of students and universities that are using Otter for accessible. And we think that shift in behavior is going to be permanent,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>Though the company doesn&#8217;t talk user numbers or revenues, specifically, it claims to have &#8220;many millions&#8221; on its standalone product, not counting the users it reaches through Zoom. And as those users discover Otter.ai&#8217;s free service, many later upgrade to its <a href="https://otter.ai/pricing">premium plans</a>, which include the ability to record more minutes and access other business-grade features.</p>
<p>To date, this sort of backdoor entry point to the corporate market &#8212; through individual employees first, not the companies &#8212; has somewhat mirrored the trajectories of other popular business apps, the company believes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, if we look at our growth trajectory in the last few year, it matches pretty well against the growth trajectory of Slack and Zoom,&#8221; said Otter.ai founder and CEO, Sam Lian. &#8220;So we&#8217;re pretty confident that, in the next few year, we&#8217;re continuing to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Otter.ai&#8217;s adoption may have been accelerated by the pandemic, but the larger impacts to business culture that took place in 2020 aren&#8217;t going away even when the pandemic ends. Not everyone will be going back to the office. But for those who do, Otter can work there, too.</p>
<p>The company has found some traction with businesses like professional services, pharmaceutical companies, financial services, and other multinationals where employees work across time zones. Longer-term, Otter.ai aims to better serve its corporate use cases by extending beyond meeting transcripts into an area it likes to call &#8220;conversation intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>That involves leveraging A.I. technology to extract meaning from the transcripts by allowing the system to learn what&#8217;s important based on the time spent on topics, the intonation of voices, and the sentiment of the conversations. It would do this in an automated way, as well, much like it works today.</p>
<p>Otter.ai, however, is not a service meant for highly confidential conversations. The recorded conversation is encrypted in transit and at rest, but is decrypted while processing. The conversations also have to be decrypted to create the index. Plus, Otter.ai transcripts are used as training data to improve its accuracy &#8212; learning from users&#8217; manual corrections, from new accents, and the like.</p>
<p>This could ultimately prove to be a limiting factor to large-scale adoption within more sensitive business contexts. But Otter, nevertheless, remains focused more so on its work-related uses cases for the time being, rather than the numerous other areas where its technology can be used &#8212;  like podcast transcriptions, integrations with social audio apps (like Clubhouse), online events, and more. Otter.ai is serving these markets, but it&#8217;s preparing to staff up in sales to gain more corporate clients.</p>
<p>In addition to sales, where it also expects to hire a VP of Sales, Otter plans to grow its now 25-person team with additions across R&amp;D, marketing, A.I. science, backend and frontend engineering, design, and product management. By year-end, it believes it will triple its headcount with the new hires &#8212; some of which may be remote workers.</p>
<p>Otter.ai will also invest the new funds into raising awareness for its app through channels like social and search, content marketing, organic social and more. And it will work to grow revenues through continued free to paid conversations and develop its technology.</p>
<p>John Connolly, Managing Director at Spectrum Equity, has now joined Otter&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the workplace has evolved and online meetings are the new normal, Otter.ai is at the<br />
forefront leading the transformational shift of the future of work and more effective online<br />
interactions,&#8221; he said, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to be partnering with Sam and the entire team at Otter.ai to support the company’s continued market leadership. We look forward to providing the guidance and strategic resources to drive focused product innovation and operational growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning Coinbase, an American cryptocurrency exchange, released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">an S-1 filing</a> ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/coinbase-is-going-public-via-direct-listing/">its direct listing</a>. The company&#8217;s public debut has been hotly anticipated thanks to recent activity amongst bitcoin and other blockchain-based assets, the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">controversial political positions</a>, and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">spiking valuation on private exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s financials show a company that grew rapidly from 2019 to 2020. More than that, the company also crossed the threshold into unadjusted profitability; it&#8217;s common amongst quickly-growing tech companies to lean more heavily on adjusted profit and other more flattering metrics.</p>
<p>In 2019 Coinbase $30.4 million against $533.7 million in revenue. In 2020 the company&#8217;s net income rose to $127.5 million against $1.28 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>The crypto unicorn grew just over 139% in 2020, a massive improvement on its 2019 results. The company&#8217;s scale and growth help us understand why some investors are bidding its value up to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/"> as</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">much as $100 billion on the private markets</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase has highly variable revenues. The company posted revenues of $190.6 million in Q1 2020, a number that dipped to $186.4 million in the second quarter. Then Coinbase&#8217;s topline accelerated in Q3 2020 to $315.4 million, and $585.1 million in the final quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why Coinbase is moving forward with its direct listing now; the company just posted an excellent quarter.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Working for social justice isn&#8217;t a &#8216;distraction&#8217; for mission-focused companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/embed/#?secret=RgWbYNBERo" data-secret="RgWbYNBERo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In that outsized fourth-quarter period, Coinbase generated operating income of $226.6 million, and net income of $176.8 million. Those represent high-quality profitability improvements from preceding periods, and provide Coinbase with attractive end-of-year profit margins.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange generates the vast majority of its revenues from transaction revenues, as anticipated. Coinbase also has a comparatively modest &#8220;subscription and services&#8221; revenue category, which was worth around $20.7 million in Q4 2020 revenues.</p>
<p>Finally, Coinbase swun from operating cash flow negative in 2019 to incredibly cash-flow positive in 2020. However, the $3.0 billion in positive operating cash flow that Coinbase generated last year includes &#8220;$2.7 billion related to cash from the change in custodial funds due to customers,&#8221; diminishing the number to a more understandable scale.</p>
<p>This is a first look, but Coinbase is a quickly growing, profitable unicorn that looks more than ready for its direct listing. The question ahead of investors is merely how to value Coinbase&#8217;s revenue growth as it does track with broader market interest in cryptocurrencies, a historically fluid quantity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s Xiaomi had dominated the Indian smartphone market for three consecutive years until recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/samsung-beats-xiaomi-to-reclaim-no-1-spot-in-indian-smartphone-market/">losing the top spot to Samsung</a>. It has played by the Indian government&#8217;s rulebook to support domestic manufacturing, making smartphones in India rather than shipping them from its home country of China. Now it is further ramping up production in India by adding two new supply chain partners, BYD and DBG, the company said in an announcement on Thursday.</p>
<p>The move comes at a time when the Indian government is applying more pressure on Chinese tech companies. Along with TikTok, dozens of other popular Chinese apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">were banned in India</a> last June over national security concerns.</p>
<p>So far the hardware companies have remained largely unaffected, but worsening India-China relations won&#8217;t likely bode well for Chinese companies that are wooing Indian consumers. Xiaomi and its Chinese competitors Vivo, Oppo and Oppo-affiliated Realme together commanded as much as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/samsung-beats-xiaomi-to-reclaim-no-1-spot-in-indian-smartphone-market/">64% of the Indian market</a> in the third quarter of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is probably the time for Chinese firms to demonstrate to the Indian government how they could make contributions to the local economy. Under the new production partnerships, Xiaomi will be able to significantly ratchet up its output in India, the company said.</p>
<p>The tie-up with BYD and DBG also reflects a growing trend of Chinese manufacturers setting up overseas plants to cope with rising labor costs back home and increasingly hostile trade policies against China. BYD is China&#8217;s largest electric carmaker with a long history of making electronics parts, while DBG has been a major supplier to Chinese telecom firms including Huawei. DBG has set up a production plant in Haryana and has increased Xiaomi&#8217;s local production by about 20%. BYD&#8217;s facility in Tamil Nadu is scheduled to begin operation by H1 this year.</p>
<p>Prior to its deals with BYD and DBG, Xiaomi was already making 99% of its smartphones in India through Apple&#8217;s long-time contract manufacturers, the Taiwanese giant Foxconn and California-based Flex.</p>
<p>Xiaomi also stressed that it sources locally, buying mother-boards, batteries, chargers and other components from domestic suppliers like Sunny India and NVT, which<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> together account for over 75% of the value of its smartphones.</span></p>
<p>Separately, Xiaomi&#8217;s India business has onboarded a new partner, Ohio-based Radiant Technology, to make its smart TVs, which have been a bestseller in India. Local electronics company Dixon currently makes its smart TVs.</p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s localization effort has led to a 60,000-strong team in India, six years after it first landed in the country, including staff in production, sales, and logistics. The company prides itself on boosting local employment. As Manu Kumar Jain, managing director for Xiaomi India, pointed out in toay&#8217;s announcement, the company added 10,000 employees in India last year. &#8220;When organizations were downsizing their workforce, we were focused on putting together the building blocks for our growth in the India market – our employees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The massive shift to online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic means retailers need to analyze customer data quickly in order to compete against rivals like Amazon. <a href="https://lexer.io/">Lexer</a>, a customer data platform headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, helps brands manage data by organizing it on one platform, making analysis easier for small to medium-sized brands. The company announced today that it has raised $25.5 million in Series B funding for expansion in Australia, the United States and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The round was led by Blackbird Ventures and King River Capital, with participation from returning investor January Capital, and brings Lexer’s total raised so far to $33 million. Blackbird Ventures co-founder and partner Rick Baker will join Lexer’s board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2010 by Aaron Wallis, Chris Brewer and Dave Whittle, and its clients include Quiksilver, DC Shoes, John Varvatos and Sur La Table. The new funding will be used to add 50 more people to Lexer’s team, with plans to double its headcount in Australia, the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Whittle, the company’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch it will also add more features to provide retailers with enterprise-grade customer data, insight, marketing, sales and service capabilities.</p>

<p>Brands use Lexer to increase their incremental sales, which includes sales to both existing and new customers, by helping them understand things like shopping patterns among different groups of visitors, which customers are most likely to make future purchases and what marketing strategies results in the most sales.</p>
<p>Lexer’s best-known competitors include Segments, which was acquired by Twilio for $3.2 billion last year, and Adobe Analytics. Whittle said Lexer’s key differentiator is providing an end-to-end solution.</p>
<p>While brands often have to use multiple data and analytics software to understand data from different sources, Lexer’s goal is to make everything accessible in one platform. &#8220;Our customers don’t have to engage expensive and time-consuming third parties for strategy, implementation, customization and project management,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Before Lexer’s Series B, most of its growth came from single brands, or groups of mid-market retail brands. Now it’s focusing on working with all sizes of brands, Whittle added.</p>
<p>The pandemic has forced many brands to place a greater emphasis on digital engagement to increase their online sales and stand out from other e-commerce merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are literally hundreds of tactics we have enabled our customers to deploy to help them adapt to the limitations and barriers COVID put in place. For example, we helped retailers migrate offline customers to shop on their e-commerce sites,&#8221; said Whittle. &#8220;Another way was that if stock was low due to supply constraints caused by COVID, we helped retailers target their high-value and loyal customers to ensure customers satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">Facebook grabbed eyeballs globally by blocking news publishers and turning off news-sharing on its platform in Australia</a>, the country&#8217;s parliament has approved legislation that makes it mandatory for platform giants like Facebook and Google to negotiate to remunerate local news publishers for their content, to take account of how journalism is shared on their platforms.</p>
<p>The News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code was developed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">conjunction with</a> Australia&#8217;s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) with the aim of addressing the power imbalance that exists between digital platforms and news businesses.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W3wk090A9d"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/embed/#?secret=W3wk090A9d" data-secret="W3wk090A9d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook and Google had both lobbied aggressively against the legislation, with Google initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/google-threatens-to-close-its-search-engine-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-digital-news-code/">threatening to close down its search engine in Australia</a> &#8212; before changing tack and hurrying to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-google-idUSKBN2A50FB">strike deals with local publishers</a> in a bid to undercut the law by showing an alternative model.</p>
<p>But none of the tech giants&#8217; moves derailed the legislative effort entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Code will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate, helping to sustain public interest journalism in Australia,&#8221; said treasury minister Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher in a <a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/parliament-passes-news-media-and-digital-platforms">joint statement</a> today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Code provides a framework for good faith negotiations between the parties and a fair and balanced arbitration process to resolve outstanding disputes,&#8221; they added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The operation of the code will be reviewed by the government within a year &#8220;to ensure it is delivering outcomes that are consistent with the Government’s policy intent&#8221;, they added.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/facebook-to-restore-news-sharing-in-australia-after-government-makes-amendments-to-proposed-law/">Tuesday</a> Facebook reversed course on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">intentionally over-broad</a> news ban after the government agreed to make amendments to the draft legislation &#8212; including adding a two-month mediation period to allow digital platforms and publishers to agree deals before being forced to enter into arbitration.</p>
<p>The government also agreed to take platforms&#8217; existing deals with publishers into account before deciding whether the code applies to them and provide them with one month&#8217;s notice before taking a final decision.</p>
<p>Facebook said it was satisfied with the tweaks, having been concerned commercial deals it struck off its own bat would not be taken into account.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/the-real-story-of-what-happened-with-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">blog post</a> which the tech giant entitled &#8220;the real story&#8221; (yes, really), Facebook&#8217;s chief spin doctor, Nick Clegg &#8212; aka the former deputy prime minister of the UK &#8212; wrote that the law as originally drafted would have forced it to pay &#8220;potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, after further discussion, the Australian government has agreed to changes that mean fair negotiations are encouraged without the looming threat of heavy-handed and unpredictable arbitration,&#8221; Clegg added.</p>
<p>Who exactly has come out on top in this stand off between a sovereign government and two of the biggest tech giants in the world remains to be seen. But if Facebook and Google were hoping to block the law they certainly failed.</p>
<p>Claims by the Australian government that public interest journalism has won are, however, being tempered by critical suggestions that the law will merely end up favoring big media over small publishers &#8212; after all, it&#8217;s the larger publishers Google has rushed to strike deals with, for example.</p>
<p>How much of the adtech duopoly&#8217;s money ends up trickling down to support smaller publishers and grow media pluralism in Australia isn&#8217;t yet clear. But the suspicion among some is that the whole episode amounts to a shake down of big tech by big media via their friends in government &#8212; and that ugly oligarchy won.</p>
<p>There is also the risk that by directly linking the funding of public interest journalism &#8212; and therefore, by implication, the vitality of a country&#8217;s democracy &#8212; to tech giants like Facebook and Google it will further entrench the monopoly positions of those selfsame giants.</p>
<p>Suddenly calls to break up Google et al can be conflated with &#8216;harming democracy&#8217; by taking money away from &#8216;public interest journalism&#8217;. Even just the claim of support suggests rich PR pickings for Facebook and co.</p>
<p>Yet these are platform giants that already have massive and unprecedented power over the public information sphere &#8212; as Facebook just demonstrated, via its flex against legislators (showing it can flip a switch to crater traffic to all sorts of publicly valuable information if it so chooses, leaving all its users in an entire country vulnerable to disinformation).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kiq9x5HNpp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">Facebook applies overly broad content block in flex against Australia&#8217;s planned news reuse law</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook applies overly broad content block in flex against Australia&#8217;s planned news reuse law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/embed/#?secret=kiq9x5HNpp" data-secret="kiq9x5HNpp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Their dominance has also long been implicated in harming democracy around the world &#8212; as their ad-funded business models profile people and amplify content for profit, without any kind of public service mission (quite unlike traditional media).</p>
<p>So if the tech giants were looking for a cheap way to reduce their antitrust risk then paying over a couple of billion every few years to regional publishers (who they may hope will also dial down their techlash rhetoric as a result) probably doesn&#8217;t sound so bad.</p>
<p>Facebook said this week that it plans to spend at least $1BN on &#8216;supporting&#8217; the news media over the next three years. Google also recently outted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">$1BN fund for news licensing fees</a>.</p>
<p>Neither company can claim it just discovered the existence of journalism; it&#8217;s crystal clear these suddenly pledged billions are only on the table because lawmakers have made platforms paying for news mandatory. (Australia is not alone here; EU lawmakers also legislated in recent years to extend copyright to cover snippets of news &#8212; which is starting to result in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">Google striking licensing deals with publishers in Europe</a>.)</p>
<p>So news publishers are certainly winning by gaining revenue that wasn&#8217;t being made available to them before. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though at what wider cost &#8212; if the mechanism being used to support them helps entrench anti-democratic monopolists?</span></p>
<p>The lack of transparency around the commercial deals being struck between platforms and publishers is certainly unhelpful. Without clarity on such arrangements the risk, again, is that the law will favor the big publishers while the smaller ones (who may have more of a public interest mission) will be at a disadvantage &#8212; needing to work even harder to compete with tabloid giants further fattened up with fresh adtech profits.</p>
<p>Australia has for certain won something, though. It&#8217;s bagged the world&#8217;s attention for taking on tech giants through a legislative code.</p>
<p>Its direct thrust at Facebook and Google &#8212; coming up with a framework tailor made to take on their market power &#8212; has caught the eye of other policymakers and competition regulators.</p>
<p>The chief of the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority, Andrea Coscelli, said <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p097vbtc">this week</a> that he&#8217;s watching the media code with interest as the UK government moves at a clip to set up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition regulator with the aim of reining in big tech</a>, calling Australia&#8217;s approach of having a backstop of mandatory arbitration if commercial negotiations fail &#8220;a sensible one&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely following what&#8217;s happening in Australia,&#8221; he told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p097vbtc">BBC</a>. &#8220;We think they are dealing with problems we have in the UK as well and they are coming up with possible solutions to that. There are many variants to it but certainly I think it&#8217;s a very important data point for what we could in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if the UK should follow Australia&#8217;s example, Coscelli gave a cautious thumbs up to something along those lines, saying: &#8220;We have said we should also think about fair trading between publishers and the platforms for news content. So I know both government and parliament is certainly interested in what&#8217;s happening in Australia &#8212; and potentially thinking about something similar.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pet tech company Fi today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B. The round, led by Chuck Murphy of Longview Asset Management, follows a $7 million Series A raised back in 2019. The round values the startup at north of $200 million.</p>
<p>The New York-based startup specializes in connected dog collars, releasing its Series 2 device late last year. The second-gen version of the product brings some key hardware improvements to the pet tracking device, including battery optimization that gives up to three months of life on a charge (with an average of around 1.5, according to the company).</p>
<p>The device relies on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, sending users a notification when a dog has traveled outside an AI-determined geofenced area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has experienced solid growth since launching in March 2019, and says demand for its product continued to grow in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s still a fairly small operation, but Fi is working on growing its availability in the U.S. The product was made available on the mega-pet online retailer Chewy in Q4 of last year.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4ANaW8QJlQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“There’s such a huge market in the U.S. that we’re just scratching the surface,” founder and CEO Jonathan Bensamoun tells TechCrunch. “We want to stay focused here. And really make this a household product. The number one limitation to growth is that people just don’t know we exist or that the category exists.”</p>
<p>The company says discussions with large brick and mortar pet retailers are currently “up in the air.” In addition to research, the funding round will go toward marketing and exploring additional retail partnerships to help grow the product’s footprint.</p>
<p>“We’ve been tracking Jonathan and the team at Fi for over a year now and have been incredibly impressed with their execution and rapid growth rate,” AVP partner Courtney Robinson says in a statement offered to TechCrunch. They have established themselves as the clear leader in the emerging category of connected collars, with a device that blows away the competition in terms of design, battery life, and accuracy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sustainability focused shoe maker <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/?">Allbirds</a> has taken another step to green its supply chain with a small $2 million investment in a new company called <a href="https://www.naturalfiberwelding.com/">Natural Fiber Welding</a>.</p>
<p>Announced this morning, the investment in Natural Fiber Welding will see <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/?">Allbirds</a> bring a vegan leather replacement option to customers by December 2021. It&#8217;s a natural addition for a company that has always billed itself as focused on environmental impact in other aspects of its apparel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Allbirds these days is far more than a shoe company and Natural Fiber Weldings suite of products that include both a purportedly tougher cotton fiber made using the company&#8217;s proprietary processing technology and a plant-based leather substitute.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those materials could find their way into Allbirds array of socks, shoes, tshirts, underwear, sweaters, jackets, and face masks. Natural Fiber Welding already touts a relationship with Porsche on its website, so Allbirds isn&#8217;t the only company that&#8217;s warmed to the Peoria, Ill.-based startup&#8217;s new materials.</p>
<p>With the addition of Allbirds Natural Fiber Welding has raised roughly $15 million, according to data from Pitchbook. Other investors in the company include Central Illinois Angels, Prairie Crest Capital, Ralph Lauren Corp. and <a href="https://capitalv.vc/">Capital V</a>, an investment firm focused on backing vegan products.</p>
<p>Allbirds is far from the only clothier to make the jump to plant-based materials in the past year. The buzzy clothing company Pangaia invested $2 million into a company called Kintra which is making a bio-based polyester substitute in December.</p>
<p>By the far the biggest startup name in the sustainable fashion space is a company like <a href="https://boltthreads.com/">Bolt Threads</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/bolt-threads-partners-with-adidas-owners-of-balenciaga-and-gucci-and-stella-mccartney-on-mushroom-leather/">which has inked deals with companies including Stella McCartney, Adidas, and the owner of the Balenciaga fashion house</a> (among others).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bolt Threads partners with Adidas, owners of Balenciaga and Gucci, and Stella McCartney on mushroom leather&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/bolt-threads-partners-with-adidas-owners-of-balenciaga-and-gucci-and-stella-mccartney-on-mushroom-leather/embed/#?secret=6gQzZL79jk" data-secret="6gQzZL79jk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other startups that have raised significant capital for plant-based fabrics and materials are companies like Mycoworks, which raised $45 million last year from backers include John Legend, Natalie Portman along with more traditional investors like WTT Investment Ltd. (Taipei, Taiwan), DCVC Bio, Valor Equity Partners, Humboldt Fund, Gruss &amp; Co., Novo Holdings, 8VC, SOSV, AgFunder, Wireframe Ventures and Tony Fadell.</p>
<p>With Natural Fiber Welding&#8217;s products Allbirds is boasting about a significantly reduced environmental footprint for its leather-like material. Natural Fiber Welding claims its material reduce the associated carbon footprint by 40 times and uses 17 times less carbon in its manufacturing than synthetic leather made from plastic.</p>
<p>The company does say that the plant leather will use natural rubber, <a href="https://www.mightyearth.org/2019/03/20/launch-of-new-global-platform-sets-stage-for-rubber-industry-to-address-environmental-damage/">an industry with its own history of human rights abuses, that&#8217;s also trying to clean up its act</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For too long, fashion companies have relied on dirty synthetics and unsustainable leather, prioritizing speed and cost over the environment,” says Joey Zwillinger, co-founder and co-CEO of Allbirds, in a statement. “Natural Fiber Welding is creating scalable, sustainable antidotes to leather, and doing so with the potential for a game-changing 98% reduction in carbon emissions. Our partnership with NFW and planned introduction of Plant Leather based on their technology is an exciting step on our journey to eradicate petroleum from the fashion industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Allbirds for additional comment, but had not received a reply at the time of publication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="&quot;https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6”">survey of VCs in the Czech Republic and Prague</a> will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how the Prague, and the broader Czech, startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in the Czech Republic, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doubtnut, an Indian startup that helps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/two-year-old-indian-edtech-startup-doubtnut-raises-15m/">students learn and master concepts from math and science</a> using short videos, has raised $31 million in a new financing round, months after it rejected an acquisition offer from India&#8217;s largest edtech firm Byju&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The three-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered startup said SIG and James Murdoch&#8217;s Lupa Systems led the $31 million Series B funding round. Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Omidyar Network India and Waterbridge Ventures also participated in the round, which brings the startup&#8217;s to-date raise to about $50 million to date.</p>
<p>The Doubtnut app allows students to take a picture of a problem, and uses machine learning and image recognition to deliver their answers through short-videos. These videos offer students step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app supports multiple languages, and has amassed over 2.5 million daily active users who spend 600 million minutes a month on the app, the startup said. More than half of the users have come online for the first time in last 12 months, the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup said it has developed a bank of over 65 million questions in nine languages for students from sixth grade to high-school. Unlike several other popular edtech firms, Doubtnut said its app reaches students in smaller towns and cities. &#8220;85% of the current base comes from outside of the top 15 Indian cities, and 60% users study in state boards where typical medium of instruction is the local vernacular language,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported last year that Byju&#8217;s was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-doubtnut-for-more-than-125m/">talks to acquire Doubtnut for as much as $150 million</a>. Byju&#8217;s later lowered its deal offer, after which the two firms ended their talks.</p>
<p>James Murdoch last month announced he was reuniting with Uday Shankar, an executive who helped him build the Murdoch family&#8217;s Star business in India, which was later sold to Disney. Shankar will work with Murdoch to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; Lupa&#8217;s efforts in India, Murdoch said last month. Lupa has backed nearly a dozen startups so far, including Indian news aggregator and social app DailyHunt.</p>
<p>“Doubtnut has been built with a vision to improve learning outcomes for all students, especially those outside the major Indian cities. We specialize in developing content in vernacular languages and use technology to create affordable solutions for people in this large target segment,” said Tanushree Nagori, co-founder and CEO of Doubtnut, adding,</p>
<p>“We are pleased to welcome onboard SIG and Lupa; SIG brings in strong experience of investing in ed-tech companies globally and Lupa Systems brings unparalleled experience of building world-class businesses and harnessing high-impact technologies,” she added.</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to add support for more language and broaden the scope of subjects it covers today. Doubtnut is also planning to introduce paid courses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India announced sweeping rules to regulate social media firms, streaming services, and digital news outlets on Thursday, posing new challenges for giants such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Netflix that count Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy as their key overseas market.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s IT, Law, and Justice minister, said in a press conference that social media companies will be required to acknowledge takedown requests of unlawful, misinformation and violent content within 24 hours and deliver a complete redressal in within 15 days. In sensitive cases such as those surrounding explicit sexual content, firms will be required to take down the content within 24 hours.</p>
<p>These firms will also be required to appoint compliance, nodal contact, and resident grievance officers whose names and contract details will be shared with New Delhi to effectively address on-ground concerns. Firms will also have to set up a local office in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new rules, which have been in the works since 2018, comes weeks after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">declined to comply with some of New Delhi&#8217;s orders</a> amid a protest by farmers in the capital city. The government said at the time said that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/india-sends-warning-to-twitter-over-lifting-block-on-accounts-and-noncompliance-of-order/">couldn&#8217;t act as the judge or justify non-compliance.</a></p>
<p>Prasad said today social media firms will have to disclose the originator of objectionable content. “We don’t want to know the content, but firms need to be able to tell who was the first person who began spreading misinformation or other objectionable content,” he said. WhatsApp has previously said that it can&#8217;t comply with such traceability requests without compromising end-to-end encryption security for every user.</p>
<p>Firms will also be required to publish a monthly compliance report to disclose the number of requests they have received and specify the actions they took. They will also be required to offer a voluntary option to users who wish to verify their accounts.</p>
<p>The new rules, which replace the law from 2011, go into effect for small firms effective immediately, but &#8220;significant&#8221; services will be provided three months to comply after the dat of notification &#8212; which will be &#8220;very soon,&#8221; said Prasad.</p>
<p>New Delhi has put together these guidelines because citizens in India have long requested a “mechanism to address grievances,” said Prasad. India has been working on a law aimed at intermediaries since 2018 and in the past year, broadened its scope to cover streaming services and online news publications. You can read the final version of the draft <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/495971399/India-new-rules-TechCrunch">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is the world’s largest open Internet society and the Government welcomes social media companies to operate in India, do business and also earn profits. However, they will have to be accountable to the Constitution and laws of India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>India emerged as a key battleground for American and Chinese firms in the past decade as Google, Facebook and others rushed to find their next billion users. But in recent years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s government has enforced or proposed several rules that impact American firms. Last year, India also banned over 200 Chinese apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">including ByteDance&#8217;s TikTok</a> citing cybersecurity concerns.</p>
<p>Prasad said WhatsApp had amassed 530 million users in India, its biggest market. YouTube had 448 million users, Facebook&#8217;s marquee service 410 million users, Instagram 210 million users, and Twitter, 175 million users in the country, he said.</p>
<p>Facebook said it was studying the new rules. Netflix declined to comment.</p>

(Source: The <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1700749">Indian government</a>.)</p></div></p>
<p>For streaming platforms, the rules have outlined a three-tier structure for “observance and adherence to the code.” Until now, on-demand services such as Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, and MX Player have operated in India without having to censor much of their catalogs.</p>
<p>New Delhi last year said India’s broadcasting ministry, which regulates content on TV, will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/indias-broadcasting-ministry-secures-power-to-regulate-streaming-services-online-content/">also be overseeing digital streaming platforms</a> moving forward. In response, 17 popular streaming firms including international giants had banded together last year to devise a self-regulation code. Prakash Javedkar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting, said in the conference that the proposed solution from the industry wasn&#8217;t adequate and there will be an oversight mechanism from the government to ensure full compliance with the code.</p>
<p>Streaming services will also have to attach a content ratings to their titles. &#8220;The OTT platforms, called as the publishers of online curated content in the rules, would self-classify the content into five age based categories- U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, and A (Adult). Platforms would be required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher, and reliable age verification mechanisms for content classified as “A”,&#8221; the Indian government said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The publisher of online curated content shall prominently display the classification rating specific to each content or programme together with a content descriptor informing the user about the nature of the content, and advising on viewer description (if applicable) at the beginning of every programme enabling the user to make an informed decision, prior to watching the programme.&#8221;</p>

<p>Industry executives have expressed concerns over the new proposed regulation, saying New Delhi hasn&#8217;t consulted them for these changes. IAMAI, a powerful industry body that represents nearly all on-demand streaming services in India, said it was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the guidelines, and hoped to have a dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>At the press conference, Javedkar and Prasad were asked if there will be any consultation with the industry The ministers said that they had already received enough inputs from the industry.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s move today comes as several governments around the world are closely examining the impact of technology firms on their citizens and local industries.

<p>When asked if India had any thoughts on Australia&#8217;s decision, Javedkar said it was not the appropriate day to address that subject.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://maze.co">Maze</a> has closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Emergence Capital. The company lets you run user tests at scale so that you can get feedback before rolling out a design update or test copy.</p>
<p>When you have a lot of users, you don’t want to roll out some changes before testing it first. Some companies run A/B tests on a small portion of users and gather feedback with custom forms and polls. But that involves some coding and complications in your roadmap. Other companies simply spend a lot of time talking one-to-one with some customers.</p>
<p>Maze lets you test something new based on a Figma, InVision, Adobe XD, Marvel or Sketch project. You can design something new in your favorite app and start a new test based on that project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From your web browser, you can ask your user to do something in your app, provide some context and ask a quick question at the end of the test. After that, you get a link for your next testing campaign.</p>
<p>You can test it on hundreds or thousands of potential users and get a detailed report with a success rate, where your users drop off, answers to your questions and polls and more. Maze now also lets you test concepts without a design.</p>
<p>Essentially, Maze wants to empower product designers and product managers. They can be in charge of the product roadmap with actual numbers to back their claims. And everybody can collaborate on user tests as it’s a software-as-a-service product. It makes it easier to run a design-led company.</p>
<p>In addition to Emergence Capital, Jay Simons and existing investors Amplify Partners, Partech and Seedcamp also participated in today’s funding round. The company plans to grow the size of its team.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, Maze has grown its monthly recurring revenue by 600%. It now generates $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue and 40,000 companies are now using Maze. One million testers have completed at least one test on Maze. Customers include GE, Samsung, Vodafone, Braze and FairMoney</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.treecard.org/">TreeCard</a>, a U.K. yet-to-launch fintech offering a spending card made out of wood and the promise to fund reforesting via the interchange fees generated, has raised $5.1 million in seed funding. The round is led by EQT Ventures, with participation from Seedcamp and Episode 1.</p>
<p>Angel investors also backing the startup include Matt Robinson (founder of GoCardless), Paul Forester (founder of Indeed) and Charlie Delingpole (founder of ComplyAdvantage). TreeCard says the funding will be used to hire talent, support the roll-out of its product across the U.K. and to expand into the U.S. and &#8220;key European markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aiming to become a &#8220;leading green finance brand&#8221;, TreeCard was founded in August 2020 by Thiel fellow Jamie Cox (who previously co-founded Cashew), Gary Wu and James Dugan. The team hit onto the idea of swapping loyalty points or cash back for tree planting, in a bid to create a fintech proposition with more societal impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once signed up, you link the TreeCard app to your current bank accounts so you can begin routing your spending through the Mastercard-powered TreeCard. Purchases you then make &#8212; or, specifically, a portion of the card transaction fees your spending generates &#8212; is then put toward tree planting projects run by green search engine Ecosia, which is also a pre-seed investor in TreeCard.</p>
<p>&#8220;[At a] high level, the climate crisis is the biggest existential risk that humanity has faced in the last 200,000 years; we believe directing the flow of consumer finances is the most powerful way to affect change,&#8221; CEO Cox tells me. &#8220;We’re building a finance company that allows consumers to not just to do less damage with their spending, but to actively improve the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building a free spending card that allows consumers to spend more responsibly. The card uses interchange to reforest as they spend and sophisticated analytics to help them identify healthy spending as well as destructive ones&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, consumer card interchange fees in the U.K./EU are very low compared to the U.S. Offering a spending card and account isn&#8217;t without overhead, so it isn&#8217;t clear how sustainable TreeCard could be on interchange revenue alone. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the U.S., where generated fees are higher, is seen as a key launch market for the startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interchange fees in the U.S. are significantly higher than in the EU so this presents a sufficient revenue opportunity for us to perform our reforestation investments and cover marketing and management costs,&#8221; explains Cox. &#8220;In the EU we’re going to be partnering with an existing retail bank who will provide all our banking infrastructure for free. This will mean that, even though our interchange fee cut is lower, it will be sufficient to cover our costs in the EU. We will announce the name of the bank shortly&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, early backer Ecosia is described by the TreeCard founder as its &#8220;mother&#8221; company. &#8220;They’re our closest partner and we’ll be working very closely with them as we grow,&#8221; Cox says. &#8220;They invested the first cheque into the company and will be doing all our tree planting for us. Ecosia’s marketing team is extremely experienced and they will be helping us use their search engine as a core channel for user acquisition over the next few years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Comments Tom Mendoza, deal partner at EQT Ventures: “TreeCard has the potential to become a leading green finance brand, going where no brand has gone before in creating a de facto platform for impactful financial management. At EQT Ventures, we’re increasingly aware of the environment and the impact that our investments have on the world around us, so we’re really excited to support the TreeCard team, who are actively working with the financial system to create a better future for the planet”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The newest unicorn in India is a startup that is helping construction and real estate companies in the world&#8217;s second most populated nation procure materials and handle logistics for their projects.</p>
<p>Four year-old Infra.Market said on Thursday it has raised $100 million in a Series C round led by Tiger Global. Existing investors including Foundamental, Accel Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, Evolvence India Fund, and Sistema Asia Fund also participated in the round, which valued the Indian startup at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The new round, which brings Infra.Market&#8217;s total to-date raise to about $150 million, comes just two months after the Mumbai-headquartered startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/infra-market-raises-20-million-for-its-b2b-marketplace-in-india/">concluded its Series B round</a>. The startup was valued at about $200 million post-money in the December round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Avendus Capital advised Infra.Market on the new transaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://infra.market/">Infra.Market</a> helps small businesses such as manufacturers of paints and cements improve the quality of their production and meet various compliances. The startup adds its load cells to the manufacturing facilities of these small businesses to ensure there is no lapse in quality, and also helps them work with other businesses that can provide them with better raw material and provide guidance on pricing. It also works closely with businesses to ensure that their deliveries are made on time.</p>
<p>These improvements, explained co-founder Souvik Sengupta, help small manufacturers land larger clients that have higher expectations from the businesses with which they engage. He said the startup has helped small manufacturers reach customers outside of India as well. Some of its clients are in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai.</p>
<p>“We are bringing a service layer to these small manufacturers, enabling them to grow their business. We don’t own the asset and are creating private label brands,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch in December. Infra.Market works with more than 170 small manufacturers and counts the vast majority of major construction and real estate companies such as giants Larsen &amp; Toubro, Tata Projects and Ashoka Buildcon as its clients. Sengupta said the startup sells to more than 400 large clients and 3,000 small retailers.</p>
<p>Sengupta said in December that the startup was on track to hit the ARR (annual recurring revenue) of $100 million before the pandemic hit early last year. This nearly cut the startup&#8217;s business in half for at least two early months of the pandemic. But the startup has picked up pace again, and is now on track to hit the ARR of $180 million. The startup aims to grow this figure to $300 million by March.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to partner with Souvik and Aaditya in the growth journey of Infra.Market which is reshaping India’s construction materials supply chain. With pioneering technology innovation and the ability to stitch together private label brands, Infra.Market is positioned for strong growth, healthy economics and profitability,&#8221; said Scott Shleifer, Partner of Tiger Global Management, in a statement.</p>
<p>Sengupta added today: &#8220;We are seeing rapid acceleration in demand as Infrastructure and real-estate companies are looking to shift their procurement to get consistent quality and minimize delays.”</p>

<p>A new fund has launched, with backing from the Singaporean government, to support tech innovation for the maritime industry. Called <a href="https://www.motionventures.io/">Motion Ventures</a>, it is targeting $30 million SGD (about $22.8 million USD) and has completed its first close, with Wilhelmsen, one of the world’s largest maritime networks, and logistics company HHLA as anchor investors.</p>
<p>Motion Ventures was launched by Rainmaking, the venture building and investment firm that runs accelerator program Startupbootcamp, and will jointly invest in startups with SEEDS Capital, the investment arm of government agency Enterprise Singapore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SEEDS Capital <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2020/jun-2020/maritime-technology-startups-to-get-50-million-in-co-investments-through-seeds-capital-and-six-appointed-partners.pdf?la=en">announced</a> in June 2020 that it plans to invest $50 million SGD in maritime startups, with the goal of creating more resilient supply chains and fixing issues underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Shaun Hon, general partner at Motion Ventures and director at Rainmaking, told TechCrunch that the fund plans to invest in around 20 early-stage startups focused on AI, machine learning and automation, with check sizes ranging between $500,000 SGD to $2 million SGD.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve got our eyes on some of the maritime value chain’s biggest challenges including decarbonization, supply chain resilience and improving safety. In most cases, the technology to address the industry’s issues already exists, but the missing link is figuring out how to apply these solutions in the corporate context,&#8221; Hon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s what Motion Ventures aims to address,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If we can bring a consortium of industry adopters together to connect with entrepreneurs early in the process, we’re setting everyone up with the best chance to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to capital, Motion Ventures plans to partner startups with well-established maritime firms like Wilhelmsen to help them commercialize and integrate their technology into supply chains. For mentorship, Motion Ventures’ startups will also have access to Ocean Ventures Alliance, which was <a href="https://thedigitalship.com/news/item/6924-rainmaking-launches-ocean-ventures-alliance-to-boost-se-asia-innovation">launched by Rainmaking in November 2020</a>, and now includes more than 40 maritime value chain industry leaders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, there has been a growing trend of fintech infrastructure players around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Africa, a handful of startups have launched in the past three years to provide such services. <a href="https://stitch.money/">Stitch</a>, a South African fintech startup, is one of them and today, it is coming out of stealth and announcing its seed round of $4 million. This makes it the largest round raised by any API fintech startup in Africa at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/kiaan-pillay-887979106">Kiaan Pillay</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/ncthbrt">Natalie Cuthbert</a>, and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/priyen-pillay">Priyen Pillay</a>, Stitch wants to provide full API access to financial accounts across Africa starting from its first market, South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With its API, developers can connect apps to financial accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows users to share their transaction history and balances, confirm their identities, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a wave of API-led financial services companies proliferating around the globe. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/16/plaid-for-x-startups/">Plaid</a> leads the way in the U.S. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweden-based fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/swedens-tink-raises-103m-as-its-open-banking-platform-grows-to-3400-banks-and-250m-customers/">Tink</a> has also been dominant across Europe, while Truelayer and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">Belvo</a> are holding the fort in the UK and Latin America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These companies provide engineering and developer tools that reduce the technical and operational effort needed for apps to connect to their users&#8217; financial accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By way of APIs, they make it possible for other companies to integrate what are otherwise complex services to build from the ground up simply by adding in a few lines of code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other financial infrastructure companies, Stitch services allows companies and developers to innovate around other services like personal finance, lending, insurance, payments and wealth management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders draw on prior experience building API products for local markets in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Kiaan Pillay worked as the head of operations for South African insurance API platform Root</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He left a year to Smile Identity, a San Fransisco-based identity API company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he worked with fintechs across Africa and discovered they faced infrastructural issues around compliance and identity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117618" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117618" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2117618" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg 820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stitch_team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117618" class="wp-caption-text">The Stitch team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, Pillay, Cuthbert &#8212; who was the CTO at Root &#8212; and Priyen were playing around building a Venmo style wallet for Africa as a side project. Eight months trying to connect to banks showed them how the lack of infrastructure in African fintech slows down progress.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were looking for a way to let users cash out from their wallet to their bank account,&#8221; Pillay tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We did this manually at first and then as a stopgap, we automated the process using screen scraping. We realized that the automated solution to this manual problem could be a product by itself and that there were more elegant ways to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This set the team up to work on Stitch &#8212; Pillay as CEO, Cuthbert as CTO and Priyen as CPO. They began working on the idea full-time in October 2019 and secured a pre-seed round a month later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in stealth, Stitch says it has gotten a handful of clients, which include <a href="https://www.idmgroup.co.za/">Intelligent Debt Management</a>, <a href="https://www.velocityclub.co.za/">Momentum Velocity Club</a>, and <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/">FlexClub</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also beginning to attract some attention from corporate companies around consumer-facing products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, Stitch has a data and identity API product, and this month, a payment product will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like most API fintech startups, Stitch charges developers and companies per API call. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for some products like budgeting or personal finance management apps, it also charges a fixed fee</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With wide and deep investor backing, Stitch will use the funding to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plans to also launch operations in West and East Africa; the company&#8217;s statement reads</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s financial infrastructure space is heating up</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These markets already have players, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nigerian startups, in the API fintech space. They have raised sizeable rounds with enviable backings as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono, a startup that only launched six months ago, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">is backed by</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> YC; For <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/nigerias-okra-raises-1m-from-tlcom-connecting-bank-accounts-to-apps/">Okra</a>, it is Pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital; OnePipe <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/16/onepipe-raises-950k-pre-seed/">has Techstars</a>, and US-based but Africa-focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/">Pngme</a> has attracted investment from Pan African VC firms EchoVC and Lateral Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, these startups don&#8217;t operate in more than two countries. For instance, Mono, Okra and OnePipe are only live in Nigeria. Pngme says it&#8217;s operating in Nigeria and Kenya, while Stitch is only in South Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be interesting to see how competition and collaboration play out when they expand outside their markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not wait long as Okra is currently in beta in Kenya and South Africa, and Mono is planning an expansion into Ghana and Kenya before the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>For the founders of these startups who I&#8217;ve talked to in the past year, competition can be healthy for the market and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillay adds that what might play out, in the long run, is each company creating a niche functionality at which they&#8217;re best</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unlike the U.S. where Plaid is dominant, I think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa needs many players. Europe is a good example; many sizeable companies are providing similar banking API services. For us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we would start to see happen is that some companies will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do a particular thing well like payments, data enrichment, or merchant identification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117620" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117620" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2117620" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="375" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png 820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Example_user_flow_screens.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117620" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stitch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitch has an impressive lineup of investors for this seed round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">London-based VC firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/firstminute-capital-launches-second-111-fund-featuring-a-whos-who-of-founders-as-lps/">firstminute Capital</a> and US-based investment firm, <a href="https://www.rabacap.com/">The Raba Partnership</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other investors who took part include both funds and angels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds include CRE and Village Global, Norrsken (a fund by Klarna co-founder Niklas Adalberth), Future Africa (a fund by Flutterwave co-founder Iyinoluwa Aboyeji) and 500 Fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he angel cohort includes Venmo co-founder Iqram Magdon Ismail, some founding members at Plaid, executives at Coinbase, Revolut, Fast, and Paystack</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On how the startup still in stealth managed to get these investors on board, Pillay says it&#8217;s down to the company&#8217;s network in the US and the belief each investor has in the product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Spending a lot of time in San Francisco when working with Smile has helped us to get in touch with these globally world-class founders and investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s an opportunity for us to provide a new generation of financial services in markets across Africa, and we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fortunate to have them back us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Brent Hoberman, co-founder and general partner of firstminute capital, the firm decided to back Stitch because it believes most online business in Africa will embed fintech capabilities in their applications — facilitating online payments, increasing lending capacity and streamlining KYC and identity checks — through Stitch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a fellow South African, I&#8217;m excited to be partnering with a team of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talented local engineers with pan-African ambitions,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Africa&#8217;s fintech sector is beginning to heat up after a slow January which saw agritech and cleantech sectors dominate funding rounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, South African digital bank TymeBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">raised a whopping $109 million</a> to expand across the country and into Asia,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extending the sort of large rounds we&#8217;ve seen in the past from a sector that attracted more than 30% of VC funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Stitch, its seed round is the latest in a series of notable deals in the African API fintech space over the last two years, where all major players have raised between $500,000 to $4 million.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore is <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Singapore-emerges-as-food-tech-hub-thanks-to-state-support">quickly turning into a hub for food-tech startups</a>, partly because of government initiatives supporting the development of meat alternatives. One of the newest entrants is <a href="https://nextgenfoods.sg/">Next Gen</a>, which will launch its plant-based &#8220;chicken&#8221; brand, called <a href="https://tindle.com/">TiNDLE</a>, in Singaporean restaurants next month. The company announced today that it has raised $10 million in seed funding from investors including Temasek, K3 Ventures, EDB New Ventures (an investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board), NX-Food, FEBE Ventures and Blue Horizon.</p>
<p>Next Gen claims this is the largest seed round ever raised by a plant-based food tech company, based on data from PitchBook. This is the first time the startup has taken external investment, and the funding exceeded its original target of $7 million. Next Gen was launched last October by Timo Recker and Andre Menezes, with $2.2 million of founder capital.</p>
<p>Next Gen&#8217;s first product is called TiNDLE Thy, an alternative to chicken thighs. Its ingredients include water, soy, wheat, oat fiber, coconut oil and methylcellulose, a culinary binder, but the key to its chicken-like flavor is a proprietary blend of plant-based fats, like sunflower oil, and natural flavors that allows it to cook like chicken meat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Menezes, Next Gen’s chief operating officer, told TechCrunch that the company&#8217;s goal is to be the global leader in plant-based chicken, the way Impossible and Beyond are known for their burgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers and chefs want texture in chicken, the taste and aroma, and that is largely related to chicken fat, which is why we started with thighs instead of breasts,&#8221; said Menezes. &#8220;We created a chicken fat made from a blend, called Lipi, to emulate the smell, aroma and browning when you cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Recker and Menezes have years of experience in the food industry. Recker founded German-based LikeMeat, a plant-based meat producer acquired by the LIVEKINDLY Collective last year. Menezes’ food career started in Brazil at one of the world’s largest poultry exporters. He began working with plant-based meat after serving as general manager of Country Foods, a Singaporean importer and distributor that focuses on innovative, sustainable products.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was clear to me after I was inside the meat industry for so long that it was not going to be a sustainable business in the long run,&#8221; Menezes said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, more consumers have started to feel the same way, and began looking for alternatives to animal products. UBS <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/investment-bank/in-focus/2019/future-of-food.html">expects</a> the global plant-based protein market to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 30%, reaching about $50 billion by 2025, as more people, even those who aren’t vegans or vegetarians, seek healthier, humane sources of protein.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/embed/#?secret=j8jGbPXM9C" data-secret="j8jGbPXM9C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Millennial and Gen Z consumers, in particular, are willing to reduce their consumption of meat, eggs and dairy products as they become more aware of the environmental impact of industrial livestock production, said Menezes. &#8220;They understand the sustainability angle of it, and the health aspect, like the cholesterol or nutritional values, depending on what product you are talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Low in sodium and saturated fat, TiNDLE Thy has received the Healthier Choice Symbol, which is administered by Singapore’s Health Promotion Board. Next Gen&#8217;s new funding will be used to launch TiNDLE Thy, starting in popular Singaporean restaurants like Three Buns Quayside, the Prive Group, 28 HongKong Street, Bayswater Kitchen and The Goodburger.</p>
<p>Over the next year or two, Next Gen plans to raise its Series A round, launch more brands and products, and expand in its target markets: the United States (where it is currently recruiting a growth director to build a distribution network), China, Brazil and Europe. After working with restaurant partners, Next Gen also plans to make its products available to home cooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we started with chefs is because they are very hard to crack, and if chefs are happy with the product, then we’re very sure customers will be, too,&#8221; said Menezes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ViacomCBS executives held a virtual investor event today where they outlined the strategy for Paramount+, the streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/paramount-the-successor-to-cbs-all-access-launches-march-4-in-the-u-s-canada-and-latin-america/">set to launch on March 4</a> that&#8217;s basically a rebranded, expanded version of CBS All Access.</p>
<p>In addition to launching in the United States, executives said the service will be available across Latin America and Canada on March 4, with a Nordic launch a few weeks later and an Australian launch also planned for this year.</p>
<p>And they said that Paramount+ will cost $4.99 per month with ads in the U.S. (less than the $5.99 charged for CBS All Access), or $9.99 without ads and with additional sports, news and live TV content. There are also plans to bundle this with the company&#8217;s premium subscriptions, such as Showtime.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s yet another streaming service<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/discovery-plus-launch/"> with a plus in its name</a>. But the company&#8217;s streaming president and CEO Tom Ryan said research has shown that ViacomCBS brands — not just Paramount and CBS, but Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and more — are well-known to viewers, and they&#8217;ll all be front-and-center in the new service. Plus, it&#8217;s worth noting that ViacomCBS already produces a number of hit streaming shows on other services, such as &#8220;13 Reasons Why,&#8221; &#8220;Emily in Paris&#8221; and &#8220;Jack Ryan.&#8221;</p>
<p>ViacomCBS executives also argued that Paramount+ will have a unique combination of live news, live sports and (to use a phrase repeated throughout the event) &#8220;a mountain of entertainment.&#8221; And from a product perspective, the service will offer originals in 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision, with easy downloads.</p>
<p>On the entertainment side, the service is supposed to have more than 30,000 TV show episodes and 2,500 movies. And the library will expand with new shows like a new version of &#8220;Frasier&#8221; with Kelsey Grammer returning to the role, as well as a &#8220;Halo&#8221; TV show that will now debut on Paramount+ instead of Showtime in early 2022. The service is also rebooting <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/love-story-fatal-attraction-parallax-view-italian-job-flashdance-tv-shows-a-go-at-paramount">a variety of Paramount properties</a> like &#8220;Love Story,&#8221; &#8220;Fatal Attraction&#8221; and &#8220;Flashdance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And like CBS All Access before it, Paramount+ will be home to new Star Trek shows — not just the already launched &#8220;Discovery,&#8221; &#8220;Picard&#8221; and &#8220;Lower Decks,&#8221; but also the upcoming &#8220;Strange New Worlds&#8221; and the kids animated series &#8220;Prodigy.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the movie side, Paramount CEO Jim Gianopulos said the company is still a big believer in the theatrical model, but it will be bringing some 2021 releases — including &#8220;A Quiet Place Part 2,&#8221; the first &#8220;Paw Patrol&#8221; movie and &#8220;Mission Impossible 7&#8221; — to Paramount+ in an accelerated fashion, 30 to 45 days after they come to theaters (a much less aggressive strategy than HBO Max, which will stream all Warner Bros. movies this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">simultaneously with their theatrical release</a>). And there will be new straight-to-streaming movies as well, starting with reboots of &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; and &#8220;Pet Sematary.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Through all of the last year&#8217;s lockdowns, venue closures and other social distancing measures that governments have enacted and people have followed to slow the spread of COVID-19, shopping &#8212; and specifically e-commerce &#8212; has remained a consistent and hugely important service. It&#8217;s not just something that we had to do; it&#8217;s been an important lifeline for many of us at a time when so little else has felt normal. Today, one of the startups that saw a big lift in its service as a result of that trend is announcing a major fundraise to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallapop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wallapop</a>, a virtual marketplace based out of Barcelona, Spain that lets people resell their used items, or sell items like crafts that they make themselves, has raised €157 million ($191 million at current rates), money that it will use to continue growing the infrastructure that underpins its service, so that it can expand the number of people that use it.</p>
<p>Wallapop has confirmed that the funding is coming at a valuation of €690 million ($840 million) &#8212; a significant jump on the $570 million pricetag sources close to the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave us in 2016</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Korelya Capital, a French VC fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/line-dag-ventures-korelya-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by Korea&#8217;s Naver</a>, with Accel, Insight Partners, 14W, GP Bullhound and Northzone &#8212; all previous backers of Wallapop &#8212; also participating.</p>
<p>The company currently has 15 million users &#8212; about half of Spain&#8217;s internet population, CEO Rob Cassedy pointed out to us in an interview earlier today &#8212; and it has maintained a decent No. 4 ranking among Spain&#8217;s shopping apps, according to figures from <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/692753615/rank-history?app_slug=692753615&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;vtype=day&amp;countries=ES&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;date=2021-01-26~2021-02-24&amp;legends=22">App Annie</a>.</p>
<p>The startup has also recently been building out shipping services, called Envios, to help people get the items they are selling to buyers, which has expanded the range from local sales to those that can be made across the country. About 20% of goods go through Envios now, Cassedy said, and the plan is to continue doubling down on that and related services.</p>
<p>Naver itself is a strong player in e-commerce and apps &#8212; it&#8217;s the company behind Asian messaging giant Line, among other digital properties &#8212; and so this is in part a strategic investment. Wallapop will be leaning on Naver and its technology in its own R&amp;D, and on Naver&#8217;s side it will give the company a foothold in the European market at a time when it has been <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2020/11/694_292594.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpening its strategy in e-commerce</a>.</p>
<p>The funding is an interesting turn for a company that has seen some notable fits and starts.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 in Spain, it quickly shot to the top of the charts in a market that has traditionally been <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/why-is-southern-europe-lagging-behind-in-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow to embrace e-commerce</a> over more traditional brick-and-mortar retail.</p>
<p>By 2016, Wallapop was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/wallapop-and-letgo-two-craigslist-rivals-plan-merger-to-take-on-the-u-s-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merging with a rival, LetGo</a>, as part of a bigger strategy to crack the U.S. market with more capital in tow.</p>
<p>But by 2018, that plan was shelved, with Wallapop quietly <a href="https://aimgroup.com/2018/12/03/wallapop-sold-letgo-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling its stake in the LetGo venture</a> for $189 million. (LetGo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/letgo-the-2nd-hand-shopping-app-raises-another-500m-at-over-a-1-5b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $500 million more on its own</a> around that time, but its fate was not to remain independent: it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/online-marketplace-offerup-raises-120m-acquires-top-competitor-letgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually acquired by yet another competitor</a> in the virtual classifieds space, OfferUp, in 2020, for an undisclosed sum.)</p>
<p>Wallapop has for the last two years focused mainly on growing in Spain rather than running after business further afield, and instead of growing the range of goods that it might sell on its platform &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t sell food, nor work with retailers in an Amazon-style marketplace play, nor does it have plans to do anything like move into video or selling other kinds of digital services &#8212; it has honed in specifically on trying to improve the experience that it does offer to users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent 12 years at eBay and saw the transition it made to new goods from used goods,&#8221; said Cassedy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say it wasn’t the direction I thought we should take for Wallapop. We are laser-focused on unique goods, with the vast majority of that secondhand with some artisan products. It is very different from big box.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may mean that the company has not ballooned and boomed in the way that so many startups might, especially those fueled by hundreds of millions in investment and hype &#8212; some of which pays off spectacularly, and some of which cataclysmically does not. But it has meant a steady presence in the market, one perhaps built on a more solid identity.</p>
<p>Wallapop&#8217;s growth in the past year is the result of some specific trends in the market that were in part fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. All of them have helped build up a profile for the company as a kind of upscale, virtual car boot sale or flea market.</p>
<p>People spending more time in their homes have been focused on clearing out space and getting rid of things. Others are keen to buy new items now that they are spending more time at home, but want to spend less on them, perhaps because they are facing employment or other economic uncertainty. Yet others have found themselves out of work, or getting less work, and are turning to becoming entrepreneurs and creating their own products to sell in a more grassroots way.</p>
<p>In all of those cases, there has been a push for more sustainability, with people putting less waste into the world by recycling and upcycling goods instead.</p>
<p>At the same time, Facebook hasn&#8217;t really made big inroads in the country with its Marketplace, and Amazon has also not appeared as a threat to Wallapop, Cassedy noted.</p>
<p>All of these have had a huge impact on Wallapop&#8217;s business, but it wasn&#8217;t always this way. Cassedy said that the first lockdown in Spain saw business plummet, as people faced severe restrictions on their movements, unable to leave their homes except for the most essential duties like buying food or getting themselves to the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a roller coaster for us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We entered the year with incredible momentum, very strong.&#8221; But he noted that the drop started in March, when &#8220;not only did it become not okay to leave the house and trade locally but the post office stopped delivering parcels. Our business went off a cliff in March and April.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then when the restrictions were lifted in May, things started to bounce back more than ever before, nearly overnight, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economic uncertainty caused people to seek out more value, better deals, spending less money, and yes they were clearing out closets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We saw numbers bounce back 40-50% growth year-on-year in June.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big question was whether that growth was a blip or there to say. He said it has continued into 2021 so far. &#8220;It&#8217;s a validation of what we see as long-term trends driving the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naver has made a big business out of keeping strong regional focus in its products up to now, so in a way you could see it continue that while still growing, by investing in another strong regional player. Although it seems Wallapop has a site in the U.K., it&#8217;s not something that it has pushed much as a business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global demand for C2C and resale platforms is growing with renewed commitment in sustainable consumption, especially by younger millennials and Gen Z,&#8221; noted Seong-sook Han, CEO of Naver Corp., in a statement. &#8220;We agree with Wallapop&#8217;s philosophy of conscious consumption and are enthused to support their growth with our technology and develop international synergies.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that it is heartening, as a consumer, to see priorities like sustainability being given consideration, too. Hopefully it&#8217;s not just lip service but a genuine recognition that this is something that should be encouraged and backed.</p>
<p>“Our economies are switching towards a more sustainable development model; after investing in Vestiaire Collective last year, wallapop is Korelya’s second investment in the circular economy, while COVID-19 is only strengthening that trend. It is Korelya’s mission to back tomorrow’s European tech champions and we believe that Naver has a proven tech and product edge that will help the company reinforce its leading position in Europe,” added Fleur Pellerin, CEO of Korelya Capital.</p>

<p>Brian Heater spent some time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/amazon-echo-show-10-review-unmoved/">with Amazon&#8217;s new smart home device</a>, paying particular attention to the screen that rotates based on the user&#8217;s location.
