										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nanit&#8217;s nursery camera pairs computer vision with specially-patterned clothing to help answer the question that most new parents ask themselves roughly every 90 seconds: &#8220;Is my baby still breathing?&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning the company is announcing that it has raised an additional $25 million in a Series C round led by GV.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GV&#8217;s Frederique Dame will join Nanit&#8217;s Board of Directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raises this Series C on the momentum of a strong year. While declining to share exactly how many cameras the company had sold to date, Nanit CEO Sarah Dorsett tells me that camera sales were up 130% in 2020 versus 2019.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Nanit debuted the Nanit Pro, an upgraded model ($299 vs $249 for the Nanit Plus) that increases the camera&#8217;s resolution while improving things like the built-in night light and overall usability. It also launched a line of &#8220;smart sheets&#8221; complete with a custom black-and-white pattern the camera reads to help measure and record your baby&#8217;s height between doctor visits.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDh_u9ULtFE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Dorsett tells me the company plans to expand its lineup into a broader ecosystem of nursery items, mentioning things like changing pads and nightlights as things &#8220;that exist today, but that [Nanit] could really amplify because of the app experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Series C brings Nanit&#8217;s total raised to $75M. While round-leader GV is a new investor here, it was backed by existing investors Jerusalem Venture Partners, RRE Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Rho Capital Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient and better at withstanding climate change induced extreme weather is going to be a big, multi-billion dollar business. But it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been hard for low-income communities to tap, thanks to obstacles ranging faulty incentive structures to an inability to adequately plan for which upgrades will be most effective in which buildings.</p>
<p>Enter BlocPower, a New York-based startup founded by a longtime advocate for energy efficiency and the job creation that comes with it, which has a novel solution for identifying, developing and profiting off of building upgrades in low income communities &#8212; all while supporting high-paying jobs for workers in the communities the company hopes to serve.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/"> also has managed to raise $63 million in equity and debt financing</a> to support its mission. That money is split between an $8 million investment from some of the country&#8217;s top venture firms and a $55 million debt facility structured in part by Goldman Sachs to finance the redevelopment projects that BlocPower is creating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These capital commitments aren&#8217;t charity. Government dollars are coming for the industry and private companies from healthcare providers, to utility companies, to real estate developers and property managers all have a vested interest in seeing this market succeed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s going to be over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">$1 billion carved out for weatherization and building upgrades</a> in the stimulus package that&#8217;s still making its way through Congress</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qK0zVoPCre"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">New stimulus bill includes $35.2 billion for new energy initiatives</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;New stimulus bill includes $35.2 billion for new energy initiatives&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/embed/#?secret=qK0zVoPCre" data-secret="qK0zVoPCre" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For BlocPower&#8217;s founder, Donnel Baird, the issue of seeing buildings revitalized and good high-paying jobs coming into local communities isn&#8217;t academic. Baird was born in Brooklyn&#8217;s Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood and witnessed firsthand the violence and joblessness that was ripping the fabric of that rich and vibrant community apart during the crack epidemic and economic decline of the 1980s and early 90s.</p>
<p>Seeing that violence firsthand, including a shooting on his way to school, instilled in Baird a desire to &#8220;create jobs for disconnected Black and brown people&#8221; so they would never feel the hopelessness and lack of opportunity that fosters cycles of violence.</p>
<p>Some time after the shooting, Baird&#8217;s family relocated from Brooklyn to Stone Mountain, Georgia, and after graduating from Duke University, Baird became a climate activist and community organizer, with a focus on green jobs. That led to a role in the presidential campaign for Barack Obama and an offer to work in Washington on Obama&#8217;s staff.</p>
<p>Baird declined the opportunity, but did take on a role reaching out to communities and unions to help implement the first stimulus package that Obama and Biden put together to promote green jobs.</p>
<p>And it was while watching the benefits of that stimulus collapse under the weight of a fragmented building industry that Baird came up with the idea for BlocPower.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all about the implementation challenges that we ran into,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;If you have ten buildings on a block in Oakland and they were all built by the same developer at the same time. If you rebuild those buildings and you retrofit all of those buildings, in five of those buildings you&#8217;re going to trap carbon monoxide in and kill everybody and in the other five buildings you&#8217;re going to have a reduction in emissions and energy savings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before conducting any retrofits to capture energy savings (and health savings, but more on that later), Baird says developers need to figure out the potential for asbestos contamination in the building; understand the current heating, ventilation, and cooling systems that the building uses; and get an assessment of what actually needs to be done.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the core problem that Baird says BlocPower solves. The company has developed software to analyze a building&#8217;s construction by creating a virtual twin based on blueprints and public records. Using that digital twin the company can identify what upgrades a building needs. Then the company taps lines of credit to work with building owners to manage the retrofits and capture the value of the energy savings and carbon offsets associated with the building upgrades.</p>
<p>For BlocPower to work, the financing piece is just as important as the software. Without getting banks to sign off on loans to make the upgrades, all of those dollars from the federal government remain locked up. &#8220;That&#8217;s why the $7 billion earmarked for investment in green buildings did not work,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">At BlocPower our view is that we could build software to simulate using government records… we could simulate enough about the mechanicals, electrical, and plumbing across buildings in NYC so that we could avoid that cost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Along with co-founder Morris Cox, Baird built BlocPower while at Columbia University&#8217;s business school so that he could solve the technical problems and overcome the hurdles for community financing of renewable retrofit projects.</p>
<p>Right before his graduation, in 2014, the company had applied for a contract to do energy efficiency retrofits and was set to receive financing from the Department of Energy. The finalists had to go down to the White House and pitch the President. That pitch was scheduled for the same day as a key final exam for one of Baird&#8217;s Columbia classes, which the professor said was mandatory. Baird skipped the test and won the pitch, but failed the class.</p>
<p>After that it was off to Silicon Valley to pitch the business. Baird met with 200 or more investors who rejected his pitch. Many of these investors had been burned in the first cleantech bubble or had witnessed the fiery conflagrations that engulfed firms that did back cleantech businesses and swore they&#8217;d never make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>That was the initial position at Andreessen Horowitz when Baird pitched them, he said. &#8220;When I went to Andreessen Horowitz, they said &#8216;Our policy is no cleantech whatsoever. You need to figure out how software is going to eat up this energy efficiency market&#8217;,&#8221; Baird recalled.</p>
<p>Working with Mitch Kapor, an investor and advisor, Baird worked on the pitch and got Kapor to talk to Ben Horowitz. Both men agreed to invest and BlocPower was off to the races.</p>
<p>The company has completed retrofits in over 1,000 buildings since its launch, Baird said, mainly to prove out its thesis. Now, with the revolving credit facility in hand, BlocPower can take bigger bites out of the market. That includes a contract with utility companies in New York that will pay $30 million if the company can complete its retrofits and verify the energy savings from that work.</p>
<p>There are also early projects underway in Oakland and Chicago, Baird said.</p>
<p>Building retrofits do more than just provide energy savings, as Goldman Sachs managing director Margaret Anadu noted in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;BlocPower is proving that it is possible to have commercial solutions that improve public health in underserved communities, create quality jobs and lower carbon emissions,&#8221; Anadu said. &#8220;We are so proud to have supported Donnel and his team&#8230;through both equity and debt capital to further expand their reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>These benefits also have potential additional revenue streams associated with them that BlocPower can also capture, according to investor and director, Mitch Kapor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are significant linkages that are known between buildings and pollution that are a public health issue. In a number of geographies community hospitals are under a mandate to improve health outcomes and BlocPower can get paid from health outcomes associated with the reduction in carbon. That could be a new revenue stream and a financing mechanism,&#8221; Kapor said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work to be done in essentially taking the value creation engine they have and figuring out where to bring it and which other engines they need to have to have the maximum social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social impact is something that both Kapor and Baird talk about extensively and Baird sees the creation of green jobs as an engine for social justice &#8212; and one that can reunite a lot of working class voters whose alliances were fractured by the previous administration. Baird also believes that putting people to work is the best argument for climate change policies that have met with resistance among many union workers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will not be able to pass shit unless workers and people of color are on board to force the U.S. senate to pass climate change policy,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to pass the legislation that’s going to facilitate green infrastructure in a massive way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to the project in Oakland as an example of how climate policies can create jobs and incentivize political action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Oakland we’re doing a pilot project in 12 low income buildings in oakland. I sent them $20K to train these workers from local people of color in Oakland… they are being put to work in Oakland,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the model for how this gets built. So now we need them to call Chuck Shumer to push him to the left on green building legislation.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix today is launching a new feature that aims to bring more offline content to users who opt in automatic downloads. With &#8220;Downloads for You&#8221; enabled, the Netflix app will download recommended TV shows and movies to your mobile device based on your tastes, as determined by your Netflix watch history.</p>
<p>After turning on the feature for the first time, you&#8217;ll be able to select the amount of storage space you want to dedicate to saving these recommended downloads on your device: either 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB. The downloads will then take place when you&#8217;re connected to a Wi-Fi network, and will contain a mix of recommendations that Netflix believes you&#8217;ll like. Typically, the app will download the first few episodes of a TV show &#8212; enough to get you started.</p>
<p>You can also cast the downloaded content to a nearby TV, where it will stream directly from your phone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After you&#8217;ve watched the episodes or movies, you can delete them from the device to free up more storage space for the next time you&#8217;re connected to WiFi.</p>
<p>Netflix notes its full catalog is available for download, not just its own original content. However, there will be some titles with download limitations due to licensing restrictions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115823" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg 1558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=1536,994 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/netflix-downloads-for-you.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The feature is an addition, not a replacement for Netflix&#8217;s existing offline access feature known as Smart Downloads. First launched in 2018 before <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/downloading-on-netflix-just-got-smarter-1">becoming</a> globally available, Smart Downloads allows users to pick which shows or movies they want to save for offline viewing.</p>
<p>Netflix says it began testing Downloads for You in late 2020, but is today making the feature available to all users worldwide, initially on Android. A version for iOS is in the works and will arrive later this year.</p>
<p>Offline downloads can make sense for those who are traveling &#8212; for example, by plane or underground train, where internet access is not a given. But it also makes sense for users in emerging markets, where access to a reliable cellular connection or bandwidth can be a concern.</p>
<p>During tests, Netflix notes it saw high usage of the feature in the U.S. But it considers the emerging market use case &#8212; where Android devices are more heavily used and connections are often unreliable &#8212; to be of particular importance. This especially true for countries like India and Brazil, and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to introduce Downloads for You. People who choose this new feature will have shows or movies automatically downloaded to their devices, with recommendations based on their tastes,&#8221; said Patrick Flemming, Netflix&#8217;s Director of Product Innovation, in a statement. &#8220;We want to make discovering your next new favorite series or film even easier, whether you’re connected or not.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Baga is going to be getting a new paycheck, which is fitting all things considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.even.com">Even</a>, an “on-demand pay” startup that ‘evens’ out paychecks for workers to give them financial stability and flexibility, will announce later this morning that Baga is joining the company as its new CEO effective March 1, replacing co-founder and current CEO Jon Schlossberg. Schlossberg will remain full-time at the company as executive chairman.</p>
<p>Baga was most recently at Lightspeed Venture Partners, the prominent VC firm which he joined in late 2019 as chief operating officer. Prior to Lightspeed, Baga was chief business officer at Lyft and chief revenue officer at RocketLawyer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even was founded in 2014 by Schlossberg and a coterie of other co-founders focused on a mission of disrupting the payday loan industry with better tools for workers who increasingly live paycheck-to-paycheck. Workers who get dropped from a shift, for instance, often have to scramble to meet their upcoming financial obligations, forcing them to take usurious payday loans. Even’s product was designed to give workers better visibility and more control over their paycheck, offering tools like <a href="https://www.even.com/platform/product">Instapay</a> that offers an advance on their already earned wages. Notably, Even <a href="https://www.even.com/platform/pricing">works on a subscription model</a> that is designed to align its incentives with its worker-users to avoid the predatory practices that plague the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/">I last covered the company in 2018</a> when it raised a $40 million Series B from Keith Rabois, who was then at Khosla Ventures. Even has had significant traction, reaching 650,000 members today according to the company, and most notably, it has an extensive partnership with Walmart, which just <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-raises-wages-for-425000-store-associates-121301438.html">this week announced it was raising wages for 425,000 of its in-store associates</a>, or roughly a third of its workforce. Even said that 53% of its members use the product daily.</p>

<p>Schlossberg says that while the company has had significant success in building out a high-quality product, it needs to pivot to a greater focus on revenue growth. “I am a very product-minded CEO and what we needed in the zero-to-one phase,” he said, referencing the concept of reaching product-market fit. But, “I am not an enterprise-growth CEO. This opportunity and problem deserves someone who can massively increase the probability of making [Even] as ubiquitous as 401Ks.”</p>
<p>He said that the company began searching for a COO to add enterprise sales experience to the executive team, but came up empty-handed. “So we offered the top job to get better candidates, and it did and we found David,” he said.</p>
<p>For Baga, the Even story fits in with his own background. I “grew up around a lot of blue-collar, first-generation Canadians — I can relate to Even in a lot of [ways],” he said. He migrated down to the Valley during the dot-com bubble, taking on a variety of sales jobs at companies like Oracle. His first startup experience was at RocketLawyer when it was just 20 people. “RocketLawyer was about making legal services affordable to all Americans,” a mission that resonated with Baga.</p>

<p>From there, he said he eventually linked up with Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2012 when they were still operating Zimride, and would eventually join the rebranded company Lyft in 2015 when it was “thinking about a B2B version with large businesses.” He worked on enterprise and urban partnerships as well as Lyft Health, a rideshare product designed for non-emergency medical transportation.</p>
<p>Baga says that he wanted to stay at smaller orgs, and so as Lyft went public and grew to gargantuan size, he wanted to reset to a smaller company. He eventually landed at Lightspeed as the firm’s COO.</p>
<p>Baga demurred during our call to describe his time at Lightspeed or his reasoning for departing after a year and a half. Notably, Even is not a Lightspeed portfolio company. Instead, he connected with Schlossberg as Even was accelerating its CEO search and found that there was “strong values alignment” and that “they are addressing real pain points … but with a fair business model.”</p>
<p>In an email later, Baga stated that &#8220;It has been a privilege to work with Lightspeed Ventures and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to be a part of such a fantastic organization. At Lightspeed, I had a front row seat to entrepreneurs sharing their vision to change the world. They inspired me to heed the call to build again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the reins on March 1, Baga said that his top priorities are to “help the team to get to know me, to understand the customers and our prospects, and to understand the product roadmap and strategy.” Schlossberg said that Even already has “a roster of pretty marquee referenceable customers across verticals of employment” and that “now is the time to scale it.” As Baga transitions into the role, Schlossberg said that the company is likely to raise a Series C round “sometime this year.”</p>
<p>Precarity isn’t going away in America anytime soon, yet as the last year has shown, there are tools that can help more workers find resilience in the labor they do. Even’s hope is that a well-built machine to improve pay can be rapidly expanded to make a difference in this economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is now in the business of flying people to space, and if all goes to plan, it&#8217;ll be the first to provide a trip for a crew made up entirely of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/spacex-is-aiming-to-fly-the-first-all-civilian-human-space-mission-by-the-end-of-2021/">private space tourists later this year</a>. Now, we know who will join billionaire and Shift4Payments founder Jason Isaacman on that trip – St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital employee, and former patient Hayley Arceneaux.</p>
<p>Arceneaux was already selected by Isaacman to be one of the four members of the crew for the mission aboard a SpaceX Dragon, which will include a flight to an unspecified orbit for a trip likely spanning a few days when it launches. The billionaire tipped that he &#8220;already knew&#8221; who he&#8217;d picked to represent St. Jude during a press call when the trip was originally announced earlier this year, but noted that he was saving the reveal.</p>
<p>Isaacman is running a months-long campaign around <a href="https://www.inspiration4.com">&#8216;Inspiration4,&#8217;</a> which is what he has named the flight. The remaining two seats will be given to winners chosen from two separate ongoing competitions: One pool includes anyone who makes a donation to St. Jude during the course of a fundraising campaign attached to the launch, and the other will be selected from entrepreneurs who build an online store on Shift4&#8217;s newly launched e-commerce platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

She&#8217;s record a number of firsts and records when she gets to space on the upcoming flight, including becoming the youngest American ever in space at just 29, and also becoming the first to enter space with a prosthetic in place – she has an artificial knee and a rod in her thighs bone due to the bone cancer she was treated for at St. Jude when she was 10.</p>
<p>Isaacman is footing the entire bill for the SpaceX launch – including covering the tax obligations of the other winners selected for the St. Jude seats on the mission. He has also committed to donating $100 million to the hospital from his own funds, in addition to whatever is raised through the public donation drive that will be used to select one of the other crew members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gophr.com">Gophr</a>, a U.K.-based last-mile delivery provider, has raised £4 million in funding, as it looks to invest in its product off the back of 300% revenue growth during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Leading the round is pan-European B2B investor Nauta Capital. The company had previously raised £1 million in two rounds, including £500,000 from publicly-listed Auctus Alternative Investments.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Gophr’s co-founder and CEO, Seb Robert, tells me the 2015-founded company reached monthly net profitability around 3 years ago and was net profitable for the whole of last year. Like other delivery companies, Gophr has benefited from a pandemic bump, but fortitude aside, is aiming to step on the gas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gophr says it has completed over 2 million same-day deliveries to-date. Customers include leading consumer brands including HelloFresh, Boots, Co-Op and Selfridges. It claims 5,000 clients in total and operates in most U.K. cities.<br />
On being net profitable and in relation to raising new funding, Robert says he felt it was an important proof point to hit, recalling how, just a few years ago, bar a couple of huge successes, we saw “a generation of delivery startups go up in flames along with their investors cash”. They included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/london-based-on-demand-delivery-startup-jinn-shutters/">Jinn</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/">Valk Fleet</a>, to name just two.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DRQF0wvic6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/">As Valk Fleet is put into administration, drivers claim to be unpaid and staff receive &#8216;death threats&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Valk Fleet is put into administration, drivers claim to be unpaid and staff receive &#8216;death threats&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/embed/#?secret=DRQF0wvic6" data-secret="DRQF0wvic6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“It was all very predictable to anyone who’d done their homework up front (I remember at the time DM’ing you specifically and naming the ones I thought would no longer be around in a year or two!) and as a result figured that a model that proved it could actually make money would have a better chance to raise going forward,” he says.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Robert notes that we are starting to see a renaissance in VC investment in the last-mile delivery space, but argues that, on the surface at least, these newer delivery startups are taking a similar approach to the previous generation.</p>
<p>“Getting a toothbrush to you in 15 minutes is great. But what do you do with the courier who’s now coming back empty handed? That takes time and it costs money. Only time will tell,” he says.</p>
<p>Though Robert doesn’t say it, that’s likely taking a swipe at a new crop of startups either following the Instacart model, such as Getir in Turkey, or the plethora of delivery-only ‘dark stores’, including Berlin’s much-hyped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">,, </a> and U.K.’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">Dija, </a><a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp, </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and Fancy (currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to be acquired</a> by U.S.-based goPuff).</p>
<p>With all the hype around drones and autonomous vehicles, Robert says that people forget or don’t understand that the delivery business, particularly last-mile, is still a people business. This means building a service that works for the couriers that power it.</p>
<p>“Same day at scale is hard, so most players cut corners,” he says. “Legacy companies can deliver at scale, but the sophistication of the service is poor, and then only make money because they squeeze their couriers. Tech startups have great app experiences and big brand budgets, but they don’t know how to deliver sustainably so they burn through VC cash waiting for robots, drones, autonomous vehicles and bionic duckweed to shore up the bottom line”.</p>
<p>“The way we’ve managed to strip out the compromise is by creating a platform that maximises each individual courier’s ability to make money, in whatever direction they&#8217;re traveling in, whilst making sure the end customer gets their stuff on time with no issues”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dE7W8OIoVv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">Delivery company goPuff is in talks to acquire the UK&#8217;s Fancy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delivery company goPuff is in talks to acquire the UK&#8217;s Fancy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/embed/#?secret=dE7W8OIoVv" data-secret="dE7W8OIoVv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gophr has also built a platform that Robert claims helps couriers “level up”. This required properly understanding the “complexity and variability of the delivery process,” including how individual couriers want to work, and how to best meet customer expectations, which varies per sector.</p>
<p>“I think with most delivery apps and at incumbent carriers the courier is kind of incidental, and seen as replaceable; we try to focus on how we can make them better, and we’re still working on it,” he says. “Being a great courier doesn’t just boil down to being on time &#8212; that’s the basics &#8212; it’s what works for different types of customer needs and expectations. You might get couriers who aren’t great at multi-drop but very good on the circuit, or that need to work on job management but more than make up for it through excellent communication. Sending or receiving a package is a bit of an emotional purchase when you think about it so we have to do our best to manage that in the best way possible. Having happy couriers is a good start”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert is not phased by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">last week’s Uber ruling</a> that saw U.K. courts reclassify the worker status of gig economy-style drivers, meaning that they are entitled to additional benefits and worker protections.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great news for shutting down bogus self-employment,” he says. “I don’t see how the incumbent U.K. delivery industry can continue to operate under anything else other than this new worker classification. If operators want to stay on the right side of the law, worker status is the one that’s closest to how they currently do business. In the short term they might be able to mitigate the impact through recent 3rd party solutions that have sprung up that provide cover for the new IR35 rules coming into effect later this year, but I can’t imagine that will last forever.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, we’ve always considered the courier as ‘the talent’ and not a cost centre or a commodity, and that the important relationship to build is between the courier and client, with our platform as an enabler, not a gatekeeper. And that’s always been key to how we operate”.</p>
<p>This means that Gophr doesn’t penalise or sin-bin drivers for non-acceptance of work. Its app show the driver where they would be picking up and delivering to, what the consignment is and what they’ll get paid so they have all the relevant info before they accept a job”.</p>
<p>However, he says the rate setting aspect of the Uber case is interesting, because centrally imposed rates can actually work in favour of couriers as apposed to an entirely free-market. “We do set the rates they&#8217;re paid, but that’s because we looked at other solutions that enabled couriers to set their own price per mile and/or got them to bid for work and all it did was encourage a race to the bottom,” Robert says. “So it’s kind of ironic that that was one of the key parts of the ruling. This could become (quite literally) a law of unintended consequences”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vertical marketplaces continue to be a key lynchpin in the digital economy, a centralized place where people providing certain goods or services can connect with those specifically looking to buy them, a position that has, it seems, become even <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more prominent and in-demand</a> in our pandemic economy. In line with that trend, today a startup out of Denmark called <a href="http://ageras.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ageras Group</a>, which has built a dual-purpose platform, providing both accountancy software and a marketplace for small and medium businesses to find accountants, is announcing a round of growth funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen-based company has closed a round of $73 million from a single investor, Lugard Road Capital.</p>
<p>Ageras is not disclosing its valuation, but <a href="https://borsen.dk/nyheder/finans/ny-investor-giver-ageras-vaerdi-paa-15-mia-kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this report</a> in Danish publication Borsen pegs it at 1.5 billion Danish Krone, or around $244 million at today&#8217;s rates. We&#8217;ve asked an Ageras spokesperson to confirm the figure and will update this post as we learn more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re also asking how much it has raised in the past. Founded in 2012, the startup was bootstrapped for its first five years, and PitchBook discloses only around $220,000 before this round. Previous investors include <a href="https://www.assetfinanceinternational.com/index.php/technology/technology-archive/technology-articles/19517-rabobank-invests-in-ageras-to-develop-financial-services-for-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investcorp </a>&#8212; which took a majority stake in the company in 2017 &#8212; and more recently <a href="https://www.assetfinanceinternational.com/index.php/technology/technology-archive/technology-articles/19517-rabobank-invests-in-ageras-to-develop-financial-services-for-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rabo Bank</a>.</p>
<p>The new investment comes on the heels of good growth for the company, with plans to capitalize on that. Ageras has now passed 340,000 users across Denmark, the U.S., Sweden, Norway, Holland and Germany. It says that the plan will be to use the funding to expand into what it generally describes as &#8220;growth markets&#8221; &#8212; new countries, new customer segments, and also adding more services to its software stack &#8212; both through organic growth and acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ageras has established a market leading and best-in-class product offering that is optimally positioned for international expansion and the rising demand for automated business tools,&#8221; said Rico Andersen, Ageras&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with Martin Hegelund, himself a serial investor who has backed the likes of Slack. “This latest financing round will support our ongoing commitment to scaling the Ageras brand and bringing our software offering to new customers across the globe. We look forward to continuing the Ageras story in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Ageras today follows a fairly typical labor marketplace model: SMEs seeking accountancy services submit their requirements in three areas &#8212; accounting, book keeping or auditing &#8212; and in return they receive three leads to contact. That model is one that Andersen and Hegelund know well, having previously built an online marketplace for home service professionals called &#8220;Fa det Gjort&#8221; (which translates to &#8220;Get it done!&#8221;).</p>
<p>Alongside this &#8212; and to further diversify the business model &#8212; the company has expanded into building accounting software, starting first with its own in-house Meneto suite, and then adding to it with two acquisitions, Billy in Denmark and Tellow in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>The investment underscores the persistent popularity of the marketplace model for online business, made popular in e-commerce by the likes of Amazon and Alibaba but extended to a range of services as well.</p>
<p>The labor marketplace model has been a perennial one in the world of startups &#8212; Uber helped pioneered it to connect those needing a ride with mobility options for getting somewhere, the likes of Deliveroo lets people sign up to deliver food and other goods to people, there are a number of platforms out there providing a way for tradespeople to connect with those needing a home or other job done, and so on.</p>
<p>And the evolution of that to expand to more knowledge worker jobs is not especially new, either. Upwork, <a href="https://www.bark.com/en/gb/accountants/london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bark</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/paro-raises-10-million-series-b-to-offer-corporate-finance-expertise-on-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paro</a> and others are among those offering a way for accountants to connect with would-be customers.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more notable is how the space seems to be growing right now: it pandemic has reduced a lot of foot traffic for business districts, changing what &#8220;offices&#8221; look like these days. That has opened the door to a wider range of people providing services to others, while at the same time possibly made it harder for them to be discoverable.</p>
<p>Marketplaces are one way to solve that challenge, and in that regard, it&#8217;s no surprise to see the <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that LinkedIn is eyeing up building its own marketplace for skilled workers.</p>
<p>That is not the only area where Ageras faces competition, though: in the area of online accounting services, meanwhile, there are a number of players including established companies like Intuit as well as newer entrants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/pennylane-raises-18-4-million-for-its-accounting-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennylane</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/taxscouts-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaxScouts</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/zeitgold-raises-29-2-million-to-automate-bookkeeping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeitgold</a>, and Stripe-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/index-ventures-stripe-back-bookkeeping-service-pilot-with-40m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilot</a>.</p>
<p>Lugard appears to be a VC affiliated with U.S. hedge fund <a href="https://nordic9.com/companies/lugard-road-capital-investor5614397573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luxor Capital Group</a> and it has also backed the delivery platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://www.inriver.com/news/software-company-inriver-brings-in-heavyweight-investors-for-international-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inRiver</a>, and others. Investcorp, meanwhile, continues to hold a significant stake in the startup as part of its bigger tech investment strategy, which has included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/nortonlifelock-acquires-avira-in-360m-all-cash-deal-8-months-after-avira-was-acquired-for-180m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring and then selling security firm Avira</a>, and recently taking a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/indian-logistics-startup-xpressbees-raises-110-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stake in India&#8217;s logistics startup Xpressbees</a>.</p>
<p>“The combination of Ageras’ mission critical software, backed by a reputation for dependability, insights into the professional service market, an outstanding management team, paired with its cutting-edge research &amp; development has ensured it has continued to grow its market position and deliver an accountancy ecosystem based on high quality recurring revenue,&#8221; said Gilbert Kamieniecky, MD and head of Investcorp’s technology vertical, in a statement. &#8220;The additional financing secured by Ageras will help to drive international expansion and support the continued innovation of its customer offering.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">retail investing is increasing in Indonesia</a>, especially among people aged 18 to 30. Today, investment platform <a href="https://fundtastic.co.id/">FUNDtastic</a> announced it has raised a $7.7 million Series A to tap into that demand, with plans to launch new products for retail investors, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/fundtastic-ascend-capital-indivara-228541/">reports DealStreetAsia</a>.</p>
<p>The round was led by Singapore-based Ascend Capital Group, with participation from other investors including tech holding company Indivara Group. FUNDtastic plans to add retail bonds, insurance and peer-to-peer lending to its current roster of mutual funds and gold investment options.</p>
<p>FUNDtastic <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/11/investment-fintech-fundtastic-acquires-invisee-for-6-5m-to-expand-to-mutual-funds.html">acquired Invisee</a>, a mutual funds and securities portal, last year for $6.5 million, allowing it to sell mutual fund products directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based in Jakarta, FUNDtastic was founded in 2019 by Harry Hartono, Franky Chandra and Medwin Susilo. While capital investing in Indonesia <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">remains relatively low</a>, with many preferring to invest in real estate instead, that number is gradually increasing as young professionals diversify their holdings. The Indonesian Stock Exchange is also launching initiatives to attract more retail investors.</p>
<p>Other startups focused on making retail investment more accessible to Indonesians include Ajaib and Bibit, which both recently raised funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter recently held talks to acquire Indian social media startup ShareChat as the company explored ways to expand its presence in the world’s second largest internet market and build a global rival to TikTok, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The American firm, which is already an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/sharechat-twitter-seriesd/">investor in Bangalore-based ShareChat</a>, offered to buy the five-year-old Indian startup for $1.1 billion and had committed an additional investment of $900 million, two of the sources said. ShareChat, backed by Lightspeed Partners India, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient among others, has raised about $260 million to date.</p>
<p>The talks did not materialize into a deal, two sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. TechCrunch could not determine the reason the two companies ended the talks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two sources said Twitter had expressed intention to take Moj, a short-form video app that ShareChat owns, to international markets and position it as a rival to Chinese app TikTok.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment and ShareChat did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">ban on TikTok last year</a> prompted scores of local startups and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">international giants</a> to try their hands at short-form video format.</p>
<p>Moj, with over 80 million users already, has emerged as one of the largest players in the category. Earlier this month, Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">inked a deal with ShareChat</a> to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian short video app. This is the first time Snap had formed a partnership of this kind with a firm in India.</p>
<p>With the buyout offer no longer being entertained, ShareChat has resumed talks with other investors for its new financing round. These investors include Google, Snap, the sources said.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in January that the Indian startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">talking to Google and Snap</a> as well as some existing investors including Twitter to raise over $200 million. A potential acquisition by Twitter prolonged the investment talks.</p>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have over 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refer as &#8220;India 2.&#8221; Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages &#8212; called &#8220;India 3&#8221; &#8212; getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat, said the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indias-sharechat-raises-40-million-says-its-short-video-platform-moj-now-reaches-80-million-users/">marquee app was growing “exponentially”</a> and that users were spending, on an average, more than 30 minutes a day on the service.</p>
<p>Twitter, itself, has struggled to make inroads outside of bigger cities and towns in India. Its app reached about 75 million users in the country in the month of January, according to mobile insight firm AppAnnie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. It inked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/twitter-moments-dailyhunt-india/">deal with news and social app Dailyhunt</a> to bring Moments &#8212; curated tweets pertaining to news and other local events &#8212; to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">Google-backed Indian app</a>.</p>
<p>The American social network has broadened its product offering in the past year amid pressure from activist investors to accelerate growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Ten years in, <a href="http://www.transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> is now Wise,&#8221; screams the press release that landed in my in-box late last week. The fintech giant, most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/">valued by private investors at $5 billion</a>, is re-branding ahead of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-picks-banks-to-spearhead-blockbuster-flotation-12194386">an expected IPO</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the company doesn&#8217;t actually make reference to a public listing &#8212; for regulatory reasons, it probably shouldn&#8217;t even if it wanted to &#8212; but the change of name will certainly make for a more streamlined ticker, while more broadly, the new moniker reflects how the decade-old company has long moved beyond B2C international money transfers alone to build what it now dubs a &#8220;cross-border payments network&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally launched in 2011 as a money transfer service for people, the company has expanded to build a cross-border payments network helping to make international banking cheaper, faster and more pleasant for its 10 million personal and business customers,&#8221; explains <del datetime="2021-02-21T17:18:02+00:00">Transfer</del>Wise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has come far in tens years &#8212; you can view an early funding deck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/transferwise-pitch-me/">here</a> &#8212; and today processes £4.5 billion in cross-border transactions every month, claiming to help customers save approximately £1 billion a year in reduced fees compared to using legacy banks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kVYTH1FWO0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/transferwise-pitch-me/">A look through TransferWise&#8217;s early pitch deck</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A look through TransferWise&#8217;s early pitch deck&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/transferwise-pitch-me/embed/#?secret=kVYTH1FWO0" data-secret="kVYTH1FWO0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More recently, having launched consumer and business products akin to a multi-currency bank account, including its own debit card, Wise has started to resemble a challenger bank, too, even if it has previously stated that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dont-bank-on-it/">there are no plans to apply for a full bank license</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company pitches the current product line:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Wise</strong> &#8211; building the world’s most international account. Send and spend money internationally, hold money in 55 currencies and get real account numbers in 10 currencies. Customers now hold over £3 billion in Wise, with 1.4 million debit cards issued. </p>
<p><strong>Wise Business</strong> &#8211; the business account for going global, it has all the features of the personal account plus extras like bank feeds, mass payouts and multi-user access. Over 150,000 businesses joined Wise in the last 12 months</p>
<p><strong>Wise Platform</strong> &#8211; the platform banks and companies like Monzo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/06/gocardless-transferwise/">GoCardless</a>, and Xero use to tap into the Wise infrastructure, giving their customers cheaper, faster payments and international banking features. Wise Platform is live with banks in 10 countries across 4 continents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cue quote from Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder, of Wise: “Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for &#8211; a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. That community now even includes the banks themselves. We’ve evolved to fix more than just money transfer, but the core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.”</p>
<p>Customers can already opt into the new website at Wise.com. &#8220;The final switchover for all customers to the Wise brand will take place in March 2021,&#8221; says the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zhou Yuxiang doesn&#8217;t have the typical profile for working in China&#8217;s manufacturing world. A soft-spoken yet incisive person in his early thirties, Zhou graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in government and went on to work in investment banking in Hong Kong, following the path of many Chinese overseas returnees.</p>
<p>But a few years into his career, Zhou realized he wanted to build his own business. This was around 2015, a time when China was consumed by a startup craze amid Premier Li Keqiang&#8217;s campaign for &#8220;mass entrepreneurship and innovation.&#8221; Rather than going into the sleek world of consumer lifestyle, fintech or AI, Zhou picked manufacturing as a starting point.</p>
<p>During his time at Barclays, Zhou helped deep-pocketed Chinese manufacturers scour for merger and acquisition deals in Europe. He saw how factories in Germany digitize their operations using Siemens and SAP solutions. In China, &#8220;factories had a lot of money and could buy top-of-the-line equipment. But on the software management front, they were still very primitive,&#8221; said Zhou in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Most of the operation was done on paper. Every day, workers received a stack of papers telling them what to do, and in turn, they filled up the sheets reporting what material they had used&#8230; When you acquire these financially underperforming factories in Europe, you realize their software infrastructure capabilities are still far superior to yours,&#8221; Zhou added.</p>
<p>That digital gap encouraged Zhou to start <a href="https://www.blacklake.cn/">Black Lake</a>, a software platform for factory workers to log their daily tasks and managers to oversee the plant floor. Since its inception in 2016, the startup has raised over $100 million from GGV Capital, Bertelsmann Asia Investments, GSR Ventures, ZhenFund and others. The company recently closed a Series C round, pocketing nearly 500 million yuan ($77 million) and bringing on new backers including Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund Temasek, who led the round, as well as China Renaissance and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Black Lake&#8217;s vision is to be a one-stop collaboration platform for factory workers and managers, digitizing data incurred in all stages of production, from client orders, material procurement, quality compliance, warehouse management, to logistics and shipment. The software analyzes these reams of data, churning out reports for bosses to check for abnormalities in production and for workers to see how they could increase their output and income.</p>
<p>Compared to SaaS incumbents from the West, Black Lake&#8217;s more localized services and affordable prices have a greater appeal to China&#8217;s wide swathes of small and medium-sized factories, Zhou argued. Black Lake tries to simplify its user experience to a Lego-like building process so factory bosses can easily customize the software for their own use. Workers access the cloud-based software from their smartphones, which have become ubiquitous in China&#8217;s affluent cities thanks to increasingly friendly device prices and data fees. A foreign SaaS giant&#8217;s solution could cost a factory at least three million yuan a year, while Black Lake charges 300,000 yuan or less, Zhou said.</p>
<p>To date, the company has served nearly 2,000 manufacturers and suppliers across the Greater China Region and Southeast Asia, counting in its customers Tesla, L&#8217;Oréal, Xiaomi, Sinopec, and Chinese state-owned conglomerate China Resources&#8217; pharmaceutical group. In all, the company claims to have reached 500,000 production workers.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing 2.0</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2115705" style="width: 3806px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115705" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2115705 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-lake-e1613910446337.png" alt="" width="3796" height="2515" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115705" class="wp-caption-text">Black Lake&#8217;s collaboration and data management software for factories</p></div></p>
<p>Black Lake is riding a perfect wave of &#8220;upgrading&#8221; in China&#8217;s manufacturing world. For one, the demand for customized products is rising as consumers become savvier. Instead of producing bottled water with the same packaging, for instance, beverage companies now design various looks tailored to different demographics. Factories need to adjust quickly to the flood of customized orders, and a cloud-based data management platform could be the solution, Zhou suggested.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China trade war is another impetus for China&#8217;s push for factory upgrade. Having felt the heat from trade sanctions, Chinese manufacturers look to cut expenses and improve productivity. That shift, along with the government&#8217;s &#8220;new infrastructure&#8221; policy to breathe high tech into traditional industries, makes Zhou all the more bullish about his business.</p>
<p>But Black Lake is certainly not the only one to have spotted opportunities in China&#8217;s efforts to modernize production, and enterprise software in China has a notoriously slow monetization cycle in part due to low adoption and companies&#8217; reluctance to pay for services. The key is finding a viable business model to fund its dream to be the ultimate &#8220;data entry point&#8221; for China&#8217;s millions of factories.</p>
<p>With proceeds from its new funding, Black Lake plans to spend on product development, hiring, market expansion, and building an open platform for third-party developers. The startup realizes it can&#8217;t build everything factories need, and it&#8217;s already working with partners across telecommunications, cloud computing, automation and consulting, such as Huawei, Alibaba, SAP and McKinsey.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Chinese factories &#8216;wake up&#8217;, their speed of digitization will definitely leapfrog that of their American and European counterparts,&#8221; Zhou asserted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been almost 10 years since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/justworks/">Justworks</a> launched. The platform, founded by Isaac Oates, was yet another example of software eating the world; in this particular instance, it was the world of HR. Since, the company has raised nearly $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>All the way back in 2016, Bain Capital Ventures caught a whiff of Justworks&#8217; potential for success. Partner Matt Harris led the company&#8217;s $13 million Series B round back when Justworks hadn&#8217;t even hit $1 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>On the next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Oates and Harris to discuss how they met, how the deal went down, and how they&#8217;ve managed their board member/founder relationship over the last five years.</p>
<p>As with any episode of ECL, Oates and Harris will also give live feedback on audience-submitted pitch decks during the Pitch Deck Teardown.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that goes down each Wednesday at 12pm PT/3pm ET. If you&#8217;re not yet an Extra Crunch member, you should take a hard look in the mirror and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Harris started his investing career at Bain Capital private equity in 1995. In 2000, he founded his own firm called Village Ventures where he spent 12 years and invested primarily in fintech startups. In 2012, he returned to Bain Capital Ventures. His portfolio includes Acorns, Finix, Ribbon, and of course, Justworks, among many others.</p>
<p>Oates served for 12 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve as an intelligence officer. He also served as a software engineer at Amazon before starting his first company, Adtuitive, which was acquired by Etsy. Oates led the HR and payments team at both Adtuitive and Etsy, learning first-hand the ways in which the system was fundamentally broken. Justworks was born in 2012 and has gone on to become a household name in enterprise tech.</p>
<p>On Wednesday&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll talk about why Harris felt conviction in making a bet on Justworks and why Oates went with Harris over other investors. We&#8217;ll also learn more about how they handle disagreements, build trust, and their broader thoughts on current enterprise trends.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll dive into the Pitch Deck Teardown. Anyone can submit a pitch deck to be featured on an episode of Extra Crunch Live, but EC members will be prioritized in the list. If you want to get in on the action, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck right here</a>.</p>
<p>As with just about everything we do here at TechCrunch, audience members can also ask their own questions.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live has left room for you to network (you gotta network to get work, amirite?). Networking is open starting at 2:30 p.m. EST/11:30 a.m. PST and stays open a half hour after the episode ends. Make a friend!</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that aims to give founders and tech operators actionable advice and insights from leaders across the tech industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">Here&#8217;s yet another chance for you to join</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpGNFGbEwmQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It turns out the most important decision made was not the vote to choose (and remove) in the election but Twitter&#8217;s permanent banning of the former President from the social network. Suddenly the temperature cooled, the new administration engaged with the details of vaccine rollout, and the second impeachment trial ended with an expected outcome. Twitter&#8217;s move was bipartisan if the trial was not.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s other big move was the acquisition of Revue, a Substack competitor we&#8217;re moving to in production of the Gillmor Gang newsletter. It features tools to drag and drop articles from Twitter, Feedly, and other newsletters, but crucially the ability to reorganize these chunks as the writing develops. It&#8217;s my bet that the newsletter container will absorb blogs, podcasts, and streaming into a reorganized media platform available to creators small and large.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This kind of organic process development meshes well with the newsletter model. It encourages more timely releases, and an editorial feel that prizes quality over quantity. As newsletters proliferate, an evaluation of time over volume becomes most significant. It&#8217;s less an eyeballs pattern than a prioritization of what is not chosen and then what is, consumed or annotated with social recommendations. As with the Gang&#8217;s Frank Radice Nuzzel newsletter, the focus becomes less flow and more authority or resonance.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Daily Commentary</strong></h3>
<p>I have made the decision to cover the media exclusively in “The Radice Files” There are plenty of general news aggregators out there, and I for one, am just tired of those stories. I hope you’ll stay with me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of non-stop Trump, the only political story in the revamped Radice File is about how Fox News cut away from House manager video testimony to a commentary on the futility of covering the violence given the lack of votes for conviction. This shadow dance happens not just on Fox but the other centrist or left networks like CNN and MSNBC. The slant is not what&#8217;s interesting; the networks&#8217; business model and the subtle effect on media programming is.</p>
<p>No wonder that streaming&#8217;s impact is being felt in the latest unicorn from Silicon Valley, Clubhouse. The audio streaming podcast disruptor is marketed as a FOMO inside hallway conversation, with a Twitter social cloud viral onboard mechanism that digs deep into your contact list and never lets go. Big ticket items such as a keynote-like conversation with Elon Musk are overbooked from the first minute. I tried unsuccessfully to join this week&#8217;s follow up with Marc Andreessen and his VC partner Ben Horowitz but it was sold out at 5000 after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>But there is definitely something tugging at me as I get notifications of people joining and creating rooms on various glitzy Valley topics. The live feeling of serendipity and catch it as you can promises the possibility of lightning in a bottle, the sensation of history being made, not just observed. Probably just an illusion, but it&#8217;s reminiscent of the feeling we used to get when putting a record on the turntable and daring the artist(s) to succeed. I still get that every time Miles&#8217; Kind of Blue resumes, the awe with which time is reorganized at the atomic level.</p>
<p>People say a Clubhouse can go easily from 1 to 5 hours. I think RSS was killed by the red unread marks indicator. Size matters? Probably, if my college research suggests. But more important than length is ROI, and that&#8217;s where the Clubhouse effect dovetails with the newsletter moment. The ingredients of both are intuition, choice, the organic breadcrumb trail, and the payload.</p>
<h3><strong>Intuition</strong></h3>
<p>Does this notification fit in with what pattern I&#8217;m trying to discern this moment. I love movies like Citizen Kane and North By Northwest for the mirage that they project of a universe fated by a biologically innate DNA. Sometimes we call it fate, other times dumb luck, but always that dumbest of phrases: It is what it is. Only this time the conceit is: It is what it&#8217;s about to be is. And if something happens, yes, I knew it. Not specifically, but given the mood the planet is in, it figures this could happen.</p>
<p>In a newsletter: the game is not to read everything, but only what and when and in what order. The prize is the analytics, which reward the reader with more stuff, and the publisher with validation of the impact of the combination of choice (citations) and context (writing.) In Clubhouse, it&#8217;s being in the room and what — knowing when to bail? For me it&#8217;s escaping the inevitability of the point being made in a podcast, or the filter of the business model of what I&#8217;m going to do next. If it&#8217;s Sunday, it&#8217;s Meet the Press. Maybe&#8230;</p>
<h3>Choice</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of choice: Choice of room, people, time invested, moment of throwing good money after bad. Choice of what I&#8217;m playing hookey on — work, cable news, family fun, sleep. Clubhouse lets you publicly eavesdrop, a broadcast @mention that doesn&#8217;t give you the option of lurking. But you can do the closest thing to multitasking: doing the dishes, playing with the dog, monitoring. cable news with the sound off, DJ-ing for a private room, driving, etc. It is the new radio, pandemic be damned. Wherever you go, there you still are.</p>
<p>Newsletters? People, time reading, research replacement, subscription development, form of payment (money, authority, trust), influence or eyeballs. The game is trading current media for future rebundling, where the new publishers, studios, and artists are grown.</p>
<h3><strong>Breadcrumb trail</strong></h3>
<p>These choices create the breadcrumb trail, plowing under the old and furrowing the new. Newsletters are the leading edge of this refactoring, tilling the memes, models, and markets for the trends that become viral. The analytics of opens, email vs. web clicks, and notification triage are implicit for the most part in their signal. Harvesting these breadcrumbs requires the impact of new content created in response to the earlier data. Once you&#8217;ve identified a valuable consumer, your real work has just begun.</p>
<p>First, you look for the signature of exultation, the embedded essence of the experience that a certain combination of intuition and action rewards the detective. For that is what this new media is: an information thriller that taps into deep reading, listening, and sharing. Every catch phrase — round up the usual suspects, or we are not the droids you are looking for — represent uber themes we crave to navigate a terrifying treacherous world. We are the droids we&#8217;re looking for, and these new medias represent possible parallel worlds where we can not just survive but honor values of our choosing.</p>
<p>In the movies, it&#8217;s called the plotline. Clubhouse presumes there&#8217;s a story worth waiting for, the moments where we gain power by sharing and decorating reactions with clues as to what part of the same elephant we are investigating. We know intuitively that we&#8217;re not going to learn business secrets, but there is gold to be retrieved from the participants as they share their sense of humor or lack of it, their rhythm of when they join, raise their hand, are successful at being invited on stage, when they leave, whether they boomerang, and only a little what they actually say. The price for this is your breadcrumbs.</p>
<h3>The Payload</h3>
<p>As much as I&#8217;m intrigued by Clubhouse, I&#8217;ve only actually joined or started a room twice. Once was by accident, as I realized by clicking on a link to see who was there. Me, I found out. Another was a conversation about a Techmeme podcast by the podcaster and Chris Messina of hashtag fame. I never could get into the big A16Z attractions. Like Frank Radice&#8217;s newsletter pivot, I was primarily interested in the atmospherics surrounding Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s media strategy. But that doesn&#8217;t obviate the steady feeling that something substantial is going on here.</p>
<p>Media generally is swallowing its pride in the wake of the political nightmare we&#8217;ve been living through. Notice I say media, not mainstream media or social media. Smarter people than me can debate the distinction, but I think the difference between the two is overstated, and more importantly, not that indicative of what the value of these new media surges will turn out to embody. More and more, the substantial writing that filters in on Twitter, RSS (through Feedly), and aggregators like Nuzzel and Medium is significant in its approach to the central issues we&#8217;re struggling with. That includes traditional players like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Information, and the tech journals, as they combine newsletter techniques with their substantial resources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing a merger of the medias, with the consensus around value and weight being measured by new metrics. In television, it&#8217;s the NewFronts combining digital and linear TV; in music it&#8217;s at the song level, not the album. Streaming has shaken the old networks to their core, with a horse race between Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, and ABC, NBC, and the old CBS. M&amp;A has swallowed Fox, Time Warner, FX, and even an old studio, Paramount. And radio? You could say the usual suspects Apple, Google, Amazon, and Spotify, but Clubhouse? Like Zoom, I think so. Twitter and Facebook have bigger fish to fry, but Apple Car and Glasses are the key platforms Clubhouse will play in as we move into the autonomous work from anywhere reality. The payload is value, time management, and notifications at the core of the move to digital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>You’ve landed on the web version of the weekly Human Capital newsletter. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to get this in your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m.</em></p>
<p>Welcome back to Human Capital. A lot happened this week pertaining to on-demand companies like Uber, Postmates, DoorDash and Instacart, and their respective gig workforces. Meanwhile, New York&#8217;s attorney general hit Amazon with a lawsuit over its warehouse labor practices and Twitter made some new commitments to increase diversity at the leadership level by 2025.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Google fired another AI top ethicist, Margaret Mitchell. The company also internally published the results of its investigation into what happened with Dr. Timnit Gebru.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apologies in advance for a slightly lengthier than usual newsletter but it&#8217;s all worth knowing, I promise.</p>
<p><em>Quick note: Human Capital is getting a new name because it seems to be causing some confusion, so don&#8217;t be alarmed when this hits your inbox next week with a different name. Name TBD. </em></p>
<h3><strong>The essential workforce</strong></h3>
<p><b>New bill aims to regulate Amazon warehouses</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California assemblyperson Lorena Gonzalez, who was behind gig worker bill AB 5, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5bn99/california-bill-aims-to-regulate-amazons-relentless-warehouse-worker-quotas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced new legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would regulate productivity quotas from companies like Amazon, Walmart and others. Called AB 701, the bill aims to better protect warehouse workers by implementing statewide standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While corporations like Amazon are collecting record profits during the pandemic, employees in their warehouses are being expected to do more, go faster and work harder without clear safety standards,” </span><a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/assemblywoman-gonzalez-introduces-bill-protect-warehouse-workers-hazardous-working"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assemblywoman Gonzalez said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s unacceptable for one the largest and wealthiest employers in the country to put workers’ bodies and lives at risk just so we can get next-day delivery.”</span></p>
<p><b>NY AG sues Amazon</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Attorney General Leticia James </span><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/final_amazon_covid_summons_and_complaint_2-16_as_filed.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Amazon for allegedly failing to provide adequate health and safety measures for its workers. As part of the lawsuit, James alleges Amazon retaliated against workers Christian Smalls and Derrick Palmer after they complained to Amazon about the company’s lack of support during the COVID-19 pandemic. James’ suit came after Amazon’s preemptive lawsuit against her office, alleging that workplace safety is not something she has authority over.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/amazon-ny-ag-lawsuit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James&#8217; statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Amazon and its CEO made billions during this crisis, hardworking employees were forced to endure unsafe conditions and were retaliated against for rightfully voicing these concerns. Since the pandemic began, it is clear that Amazon has valued profit over people and has failed to ensure the health and safety of its workers. The workers who have powered this country and kept it going during the pandemic are the very workers who continue to be treated the worst. As we seek to hold Amazon accountable for its actions, my office remains dedicated to protecting New York workers from exploitation and unfair treatment in all forms.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, of course, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer are actively seeking to form a union. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/grimkim/status/1361820493079339008?s=12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reports showed Amazon was altering traffic signals as a way to prevent workers from being able to effectively talk with each other. </span></p>
<p><b>Ex-Postmates VP speaks out about the gig economy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vikrum Aiyer, the now-former vice president of global public policy and strategic communications at Postmates, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/ex-postmates-vp-of-global-public-policy-on-the-future-of-gig-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penned a memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to his former colleagues and other stakeholders in the gig economy outlining what he thinks needs to happen next in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter, Aiyer says “it would be a mistake for us to think that mild tweaks to worker classification, or a single state ballot measure, create a durable path forward for meaningfully addressing what Americans truly worry about: the chance to work, take care of their families, and not fret about what comes next.”</span></p>
<p><b>Postmates drivers say they’ve become prey to scammers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new report in The Markup showed scammers sometimes target Postmates workers. In one instance, a scammer stole $346.73 from a worker. You can </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2021/02/18/postmates-drivers-have-become-easy-prey-for-scammers-and-drivers-say-the-companys-not-helping"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read the full story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In related news, Uber, which owns Postmates, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/uber-hires-prominent-critic-to-focus-on-treatment-of-drivers?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently hired labor researcher and Uber critic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alex Rosenblat to lead the company’s marketplace policy, fairness and research efforts. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber drivers demand PPE and compensation for time spent sanitizing vehicles</b></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Bidar411/status/1362119559403040768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber drivers shut down Market Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside of Uber’s San Francisco headquarters to demand the company provide them with enough personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also want to be compensated for time spent sanitizing vehicles in order to keep themselves and riders safe. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber lobbies in the EU for Prop 22-like legislation and loses key battle in the U.K.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over in the EU, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is lobbying for Prop 22-like standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a white paper, Uber proposed a “new standard” for platform work, where it outlines the need to offer some benefits to workers while simultaneously steering away from the possibility of collective bargaining among workers. From TC’s Natasha Lomas:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A universal standard for platform benefits may sound progressive, but the notion of “relevant” benefits for gig workers risks fixing this labor force to a floor far below agreed standards for employment — closing off any chance of a better deal for a class of workers who are subject to persistent, algorithmic management.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>In the UK, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">the Supreme Court ruled</a> Uber drivers are employees and therefore entiteld to minimum wage and holiday pay. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Also from Lomas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The case, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">dates back to 2016</a>, has major ramifications for Uber’s business model (and other gig economy platforms) in the U.K. — and likely regionally, as similar employment rights challenges are ongoing in European courts.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>DoorDash drivers are banding together to decline low-paying orders</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strategy, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anwdy/organized-doordash-drivers-declinenow-strategy-is-driving-up-their-pay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported on Vice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is designed to beef up the base pay for drivers by working together to game the system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Vice:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental principles of the official #DECLINENOW movement rely upon all drivers in the movement to exercise their right to use the decline button to decline lowball offers for higher, more feasible ones,” reads a pinned post on the main Facebook group. “Declining lowball offers forces the algorithm to raise the base pay UP on the declined offer for the next driver as the need for DoorDash to service the order increases. In turn, Dashers will see an increase in higher paying offers, many times doing less deliveries for more money and a much higher paying ‘Per mile rate.’”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Turning jobs into gig work</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg had a really good feature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the tech industry’s gig economy is impacting workers in other industries. It’s a must-read, but here&#8217;s a snippet:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Companies in a range of industries could use the Prop 22 model to undermine or eliminate employment protections. A week after the election, Shawn Carolan, a partner at early Uber investor <a title="Menlo Ventures Management, L.P." href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/17873Z:US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Menlo Ventures</a>, wrote an <a title="What Proposition 22 Now Makes Possible" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/what-proposition-22-now-makes-possible" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">op-ed</a> heralding the potential to spread Prop 22’s vision of work “from agriculture to zookeeping,” including to “nursing, executive assistance, tutoring, programming, restaurant work and design.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b>President Biden </b><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/17/president-biden-announces-key-nomination-on-jobs-team/"><b>nominates Jennifer Abruzzo</b></a><b> to lead NLRB as general counsel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abruzzo is currently the special counsel for strategic initiatives for the Communications Workers of America. For those unfamiliar, CWA has been making a name for itself in the tech industry by helping tech companies like Glitch and Alphabet unionize. Her appointment could prove to be quite beneficial for tech workers and gig workers alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, CWA President Chris Shelton said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no one who has a more thorough grasp of the National Labor Relations Board and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act than Jennifer Abruzzo. She is a brilliant attorney who understands how the actions of the NLRB impact the daily lives of people at their workplaces. President Biden’s selection of Jennifer as the NLRB General Counsel shows that under his watch, issues affecting working people will be handled by people like Jennifer who have dedicated their lives to helping workers &#8212; and not union busters like we saw during the Trump administration. We hope Jennifer’s confirmation process is speedy &#8212; working people need her at the helm of the NLRB now more than ever.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Instacart at odds with workers again</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has reportedly suspended workers’ accounts for cancelling orders. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8987/instacart-temporary-account-suspension-gig-workers-cancel-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these workers said they had good reason to cancel some of these orders, citing things like fears of safety and someone providing the wrong address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart, however, said it’s part of a fraud prevention policy that places accounts on pause if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious activity. </span></p>

<p><b>Examining the “pipeline problem”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned last week, I had the pleasure of chatting with Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin, a researcher at AI Now, about her research pertaining to the pipeline problem myth in tech. The story also features some insight from Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee, as well as Paradigm Director Courri Brady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite efforts from companies to create equitable environments, it’s clear that employees of certain demographics, like Black women, sometimes have very different experiences from their counterparts. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/glassdoor-now-lets-you-filter-company-reviews-by-demographics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor aims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to better surface those experiences through a new feature that allows folks to filter ratings by demographics.</span></p>

<p><strong>Hey, Google&#8230;WTF?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/google-fires-top-ai-ethics-researcher-margaret-mitchell/">Google fired Margaret Mitchell</a>, the founder and former co-lead of the company&#8217;s ethical AI team. Mitchell announced the news <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362885356127801345">via a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Google confirmed Mitchell&#8217;s firing in a statement to TechCrunch, Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</p>
<h2>Can data fix healthcare?</h2>
<p>Not alone, but you might be able to make a lot of progress with the right data in the right hands. And that’s precisely what the startup we’re talking about today is up to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lisagurry">Lisa Gurry</a> this week, the CEO and CMO of <a href="https://truveta.com/">Truveta</a>, a young company that wants to collect oodles of data from healthcare providers, anonymize it, aggregate it and make it available to third parties for research.</p>
<p>It’s a big task, but the team behind Truveta has experience with big projects. Myerson is best known for his time one-rung below the top of the Microsoft org chart, where he ran things you might have heard of, like Windows. Gurry was a leader inside that org, most recently working on strategy for the Microsoft Store product.</p>
<p>But now they are at a healthtech data company. How did that come to be? After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/terry-myerson-evp-of-windows-and-devices-is-leaving-microsoft-prompting-a-big-ai-azure-and-devices-reorganization/">Myerson left Microsoft</a> he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/ex-windows-evp-terry-myerson-joins-madrona-venture-and-the-carlyle-group/">worked with Madrona</a>, the Seattle-area venture capital firm, and the Carlyle Group, a huge investing group with a taste for private equity. A few years later, several former Microsoft co-workers of Myerson had wound up at Providence, a healthcare giant. They reached out to Myerson around when COVID-19 was first locking down the United States. The former Microsoft exec agreed to take part in a few calls, but didn’t formally join them as he was stuck at home.</p>
<p>During that time he learned that Providence had put together a white paper concerning the idea that Truveta would become, that by collecting data from healthcare providers a dataset of sufficient size and diversity could be compiled to allow research of all sorts to leverage it. Myerson got stuck on the concept, later founding the company. Then he called up some former colleagues, including Gurry, to help him build it.</p>
<p>Truveta has around 50 people today and will scale to around 100 this year, Myerson said.</p>
<p>Questions abound in your head, I’m sure. Things are still early at Truveta, but the <a href="https://truveta.com/blog/creating-truveta-to-save-lives-with-data">company announced last week</a> that it has signed up 14 healthcare providers to help with its data goals. Those firms are also investors in the company (Myerson put in capital in as well).</p>
<p>I was curious about the company’s business plan. Per Myerson, Truveta will charge different rates depending on who wants to access its data. As you can imagine, commercial entities will pay a different price than an independent researcher.</p>
<p>Next for Truveta is getting more data, locking down its internal data schema, collecting feedback from researchers and, later, approaching commercial access.</p>
<p>Healthcare in America is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/12/07/568948782/black-mothers-keep-dying-after-giving-birth-shalon-irvings-story-explains-why">inequitable</a> &#8212; something that the pair of Truveta executives stressed during our call &#8212; thus giving the company a huge market to improve and make less racist and sexist.</p>
<p>It was a bit odd to talk to Myerson and Gurry about their startup. In the past I’d chatted with them about some of Microsoft’s largest platforms. Let’s see how fast they can transform Truveta from an idea I can’t help but dig, to a company that is a viable commercial concern. And then how big they can grow it.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>A lot has happened in the past few days that we couldn’t get to. Adyen’s <a href="https://www.adyen.com/investor-relations/h2-2020">earnings</a>, for example. The European payments platform reported H2 revenues of €379.4 million, up 28% compared to the year ago half-year. And from that it reported EBITDA of €236.8 million. Who said fintech can’t be profitable? (Note: Adyen’s results are required reading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/paying-115b-for-stripe-or-77b-for-coinbase-might-be-quite-rational/">if you care about Stripe’s valuation and future public offering</a>.)</p>
<p>And there were some rounds that also fell through our fingers. Investments like <a href="https://www.cloudtalk.io/">CloudTalk’s</a> recent $7.3 million Series A. The Slovakia-based startup previously raised a $1.6 million seed round in 2019. The startup, as its name suggests, offers cloud telephony services to call centers.</p>
<p>We suspected that CloudTalk probably had a pretty good year in 2020 thanks to global growth in remote work. It did. In an email, CloudTalk said that it has not seen “Zoom-like [growth] figures” but that in 2020 demand for its services “exceeded [its] expectations.” That helps explain its latest round.</p>
<p>The Exchange was also curious if the company had a perspective on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">subscription pricing versus consumption pricing</a>, a rising topic amongst software dorks such as myself (more to come on this next week with notes from Appian, Fastly and others). Per the company, CloudTalk charges “for both seats and for usage,” making it a hybrid company from a pricing perspective. CloudTalk called its pricing setup “a good balance for both parties because customers like to know what they are going to be paying ahead of time.”</p>
<p>It’s a startup to keep in mind. As is <a href="https://zolve.com/">Zolve</a>, a globally themed neobank with a focus on helping expats have a working financial world. I couldn’t get to it, but TechCrunch wrote it up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/?tpcc=ECTW2020">More here</a>.</p>
<p>And in case you didn’t have time to watch television during work the last few days let’s talk about Robinhood. Which enjoyed a Congressional hearing this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">was mostly dull</a> apart from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/a-fraction-of-robinhoods-users-are-driving-its-runaway-growth/">some notes on the fintech giant’s business model</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it was a busy week for crowded startup niches. There was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ally-io-rasies-50m-series-c-as-the-okr-software-market-stays-explosive/">more money for OKR startups</a>, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/with-software-markets-getting-bigger-will-more-vcs-bet-on-competing-startups/">our question about VCs putting capital into related companies</a> in the future. Public also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">raised several hundred million dollars</a>. Because why not. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">low-code player OutSystems raised $150 million</a> to round out the group. It was one hell of a week.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>I will leave you with a few data points. First, that Clubhouse’s metrics are <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/clubhouse-social-audio-apps-rise/">finally starting to match the hype around the product</a>. People are showing up in droves, pushing its total download figures <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1362843741975965697">over the 10 million mark</a>.</p>
<p>And in news that I missed, <a href="https://twitter.com/simonowens/status/1357447879191900160">Substack crossed the 500,000 subscriber mark</a>. That’s impressive!</p>
<p>And to close, a Chicago-based, home-focused insurtech startup called <a href="https://www.kin.com/">Kin</a> crossed the $10 billion “total insured property value” mark <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/kin_insurance_eclipses_10_billion_in_total_insured_property_value/prweb17726313.htm">this week</a>. The Exchange reached out, asking the company about its economics. After all it’s not hard to run up premium volume if you are selling dollars for 50-cent pieces.</p>
<p>Ruth Awad from the company responded that her company’s “ loss rate is 53% and our gross margins are 32%.” Not bad at all. Given how quickly insurtech has gone from experiment to public-success, Kin is a company to keep tabs on.</p>
<p>Wrapping, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3imV0hhAWp4YQGP9gdm8xe?si=r0H--h4lShO6YI0RJNlfDQ">please make sure</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0X3K3claSyeXDyJO6tpRrq?si=NvvU86ChRjiuFIj-9dwfPQ">to support your</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3cCcSqkue17ytuyRyuq96i?si=2r6pjM3vQieRU3XeK8WzXQ">local heavy metal</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1tVdUeleLeYW16TjhzokpX?si=eCqbdL3PTiqsOcie7ENHHQ">band this weekend</a>,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">After garnering an estimated 8 million downloads since its launch</a>, Clubhouse’s popularity continues across the world and even outside of its original tech-focused seed community.</p>
<p>The latest news comes from East Asia, where <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23996348">Korean media reported this morning</a> that the country’s current prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, has officially joined the social audio app under the username @gyunvely, making him among the most senior political leaders worldwide to join the burgeoning app. His account was created on Valentine’s Day (February 14th) and was “nominated” by a user using the name of TJ Park (Clubhouse does not have verified profiles).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115664" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115664" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Korea-PM-Clubhouse.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115664" class="wp-caption-text">South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Clubhouse this weekend. Screenshot by Danny Crichton.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the prime minister has garnered slightly fewer than 500 followers and is following a bit fewer than 200 accounts, perhaps indicating the app’s current reach in one of the world’s most mobile and connected digital economies. His Clubhouse bio reads “노란잠바 그 아저씨” or “That Yellow Jacket Guy,” a reference to the Korean civil defense uniform worn by <a href="https://1boon.kakao.com/subusunews/5e6b4871dc055229a8af34f4">politicians in times of crisis</a> (such as throughout the COVID-19 pandemic) and which currently serves — in cartoon form — as Chung’s profile picture.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115666" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115666" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115666" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GettyImages-1208545832.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115666" class="wp-caption-text">South Korean politicians often wear yellow civil defense uniforms in times of national crisis.

<p>According to local media reports, Chung spoke in a Clubhouse room for over an hour with fellow Democratic Party of Korea member Jung Cheong-rae. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peopleinside2012/posts/5938105316215743">In a public Facebook post yesterday</a>, the prime minister said that “I heard this [app] is ‘hot’ these days so I tried it as a nighttime walk.”</p>
<p>He further said “I was a little startled by the unexpected questions and reactions but the new experience was enjoyable. I think I’ll participate from time to time in the future.” Elaborating, he said “the fact that it’s audio-only and everyone can have a conversation without reserve made me think that it’s a better communication tool than any other social media platforms, especially since currently we’re living in the age of non-face-to-face communication.”</p>
<p>Discussions in the Clubhouse room included questions asking whether it was really him, to more bread-and-butter policy issues like the high price of real estate and physical abuse in the sports world, which has dominated headlines in recent weeks in local media.</p>
<p>While Clubhouse has become something of a fixture for techies and every form of hustle culture connoisseur imaginable, the app has increasingly made forays into politics that are hardly unknown to other social networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/miami-mayor-woos-techies-what-does-he-need-to-succeed/">Miami’s mayor Francis Suarez has been on Clubhouse</a> to sell his city’s potential for the tech industry. San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/culture/article/On-Clubhouse-a-conversation-about-the-future-15886586.php">joined a “debate” on the platform about the future of SF</a>, while NYC mayoral aspirant and all around UBI nerd <a href="https://twitter.com/jonchilou/status/1360795727434293250?s=20">Andrew Yang joined a discussion about</a> … himself. Meanwhile, Bitcoin aficionado and itinerant Tesla leader <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/business/elon-musk-vladmir-putin-clubhouse/index.html">Elon Musk has even proposed bringing Vladimir Putin</a> onto Clubhouse for a live fireside chat.</p>
<p>Yet, as the platform expands globally, the challenges to its open and free-wheeling if somewhat moderated conversations are coming under closer scrutiny. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">China has now blocked Clubhouse</a> within its borders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">after a brief period of uncensored conversation</a>.</p>

<p>As Clubhouse continues to garner mainstream legitimacy and interest, questions continue to percolate on the future of the app’s success, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">how it will fund creators</a> and continue to thrive once the world opens up after COVID-19.</p>

<p>Community isn’t a single Slack group or event or newsletter. It’s an aggregation of all of these touch points, and includes both customers, eventual customers and one-time users. Despite this nebulous, disconnected reality, companies are paying more attention to various channels as remote work and digital communication powers our days. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1361745447216316419">My recent tweet underscored</a> the chord community strikes even in sectors such as edtech, which often have to sell to fragmented customer bases.</p>

<p>&mdash; natasha (@nmasc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1361745447216316419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A conversation that I’ve been having over the last week is that startups are finally investing in community in a meaningful way, dedicating actual budgets to community instead of simply stealing a few dollars away from the sales and marketing team.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregisenberg">As one founder told me</a>, “chief community officer is the new CMO.” That piqued my interest, especially because I had just talked to Commsor founder Mac Reddin about his recent funding, a $16 million Series A led by Felicis and Seven Seven Six Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">As the ‘aha’ moment of community continues</a>, Commsor is a solution to help community managers prove that they’re not wasting the budget, and outcomes. Commsor, he says, is the operating system for communities, helping companies distill how their different communities look, and feel, which could eventually trickle down into generating sales leads and revenue. Commsor could pull an insight like, ‘here are three engineers that are using your platform from Google, maybe it’s time to approach Google and ask if they want an enterprise contract.” Finding those sweet spots, and bottoms-up community adopters, is Commsor’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>Commsor, which is still in private beta, says that over the last year there has been a “huge increase” in startups that have a community budget or increase in community budget. To be a startup aiming to disrupt a category that still has a tone of gray in it comes with its own challenges.</p>
<p>Commsor launched C School to help aspiring community managers learn the trade, as well as a fund to back companies in the space. It also posted a memo with signatures from companies like Hopin, Lattice and Notion to show the commitment to defining the community space.</p>
<p>“We are kind of what Customer Success was 10 years ago, or what Revenue Operations was 300 years ago,” Reddin said. “People care about it and there are roles, but there’s still a lot of defining and growth to be done.”</p>

<h2><strong>Will your investor put money into a competitor? </strong></h2>
<p>When an investor backs a startup, they ideally think that the company will be the winner in said category, whether it’s CBD gummies, financial plumbing or peer-to-peer car-sharing. So, if they place a bet in a competing startup the investment could serve as both a negative signal and a reputation hit.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know, via Alex Wilhelm: </strong>As software markets mature, maybe the investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/with-software-markets-getting-bigger-will-more-vcs-bet-on-competing-startups/">playing field is opening up to investing in competitors</a>? Call it conveniently complementary investments.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/a16z-doesnt-invest-it-manifests/">In this week’s Equity episode</a>, we talked about the complexity of competition within startups, and how one firm’s investments seem to all perfectly and conveniently fit into each other. I’ll make you listen to the episode to figure out who, but here’s a hint: Is there a world where Dispo creators track monetization from Clubhouse through Stir?</p>

<h2><strong>An Olive startup competes with Amazon </strong></h2>
<p>Ambitious early-stage founders often have to answer a common question from investors and journalists: What if Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google built your startup? The idea behind the question is figuring out why a founder is specifically and uniquely qualified to solve a problem, even if a behemoth business throws millions of dollars and a team of engineers at it.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know via Jet co-founder Nate Faust</strong>: He sold his business to Walmart for $3 billion in 2016, and now he’s back to compete with Amazon<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/olive-launch/ "> with a sustainable e-commerce play</a>. Olive consolidates a shopper’s purchases into a single weekly delivery in a reusable package.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Faust acknowledged that Olive runs counter to the “arms race” between Amazon and other e-commerce services working to deliver purchases as quickly as possible. But he said that the startup’s consumer surveys found that shoppers were willing to wait a little longer in order to get the other benefits.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> If you were wondering when it makes sense to compete with Zoom, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/">these four edtech startups</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/google-to-roll-out-slate-of-over-50-updates-for-classroom-meet-and-other-online-education-tools/ "> Google</a> might have some information for you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1839695" style="width: 719px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1839695" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1839695" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg 5383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=2048,1205 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-527533868.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1839695" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Getty Images / alashi</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Bust the myth of the pipeline problem </strong></h2>
<p>The lack of diversity in Silicon Valley, from the check-writers to the employees, has often been chalked up to the pipeline problem: the idea that there isn’t enough enough diverse, qualified talent to fill roles. But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/ ">recent research</a> underscores how aged, and flawed, this mindset might be. Reporter <strong>Megan Rose Dickey </strong>interviewed <strong>Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin</strong>, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the AI Now Institute.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/ ">Here’s what to know</a>, according to Rankin: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The pipeline is a way to silo all of that out and say, ‘we just need to get more Black women in tech,’ as opposed to saying, ‘actually, these companies are and have been racist and white supremacist and misogynist, and it’s those institutions and larger societal and global capitalist structures that need to change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Rankin adds that transparency around hiring and corporate recruiting could help combat biases and signal important information to talent.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-justice/">TC Sessions: Justice</a> next month, we’ll be talking about how research like this, as well as structures within venture capital, impacts early-stage founders.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your enjoyment of &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8221; — a sports comedy that debuted on Apple TV+ last year — will probably depend on how you respond to the titular football coach played by Jason Sudeikis.</p>
<p>As we discuss on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, the show&#8217;s setup is deliberately over-the-top and ridiculous with Rebecca Walton (Hannah Waddingham) taking ownership of the AFC Richmond football (a.k.a. soccer) team after an acrimonious divorce, then recruiting American football coach Ted Lasso as its new manager, despite his complete ignorance of the game.</p>
<p>Anthony and Jordan found Ted to be charming, and they enjoyed the show&#8217;s fish-out-water comedy. Anthony also appreciated some of the more emotional moments later in the season — he&#8217;s an easy crier, and &#8220;Ted Lasso&#8221; definitely made him a little teary-eyed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Darrell, however, had considerably less patience for the character&#8217;s blithe naiveté, comparing it to the similar cluelessness of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/17/original-content-emily-in-paris/">Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Emily in Paris,&#8221;</a> and he gave up on the show quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing the series, we discuss <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/il-maestro-federico-fellini-martin-scorsese/">Martin Scorsese&#8217;s feelings about the word &#8220;content,&#8221;</a> and we have some exciting news about the podcast: This will be our last episode on TechCrunch, as Original Content goes independent!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;ve got a first look at one of TikTok&#8217;s early e-commerce tests, which involves a program for sellers involving product anchors on videos and the option for affiliate sales. We&#8217;re also digging into the new iOS and Android betas, the FTC complaint against math app Prodigy and more.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>TikTok tests a new e-commerce experience in Indonesia</h3>
<p>The Financial Times recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed">reported</a> TikTok was preparing to launch a range of new e-commerce experiences in 2021, including the ability for creators to share links to products, support for affiliate sales, and even livestreamed shopping. Now, we&#8217;ve got a first look at some of the live tests around e-commerce that TikTok has in progress.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a &#8220;<a href="https://seller-id.tiktok.com/university/home">Seller University</a>&#8221; website aimed at its Indonesian audience, where it details how brands can advertise their products on video. Here, TikTok explains brands have two ways to advertise, either by making their own videos or by working with affiliates.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you choose to sell through your personal page, you can then display products via livestreaming or short videos, with product anchors embedded in your content. When customers view your content, they can be redirected to the corresponding product detail page by clicking on the product anchor,&#8221; the site explains.</p>
<p>The Seller University also details other information, like how to sign up to be a TikTok seller and what sort of products are prohibited, along with other rules and guidelines.</p>

<p>TikTok Sellers have to provide their contact information, including location, phone, email, shop and warehouse location, and other required documentation to be approved. They can then set up a Seller profile, where they can manage other users associated with their account. Once live as a Seller on the app, they&#8217;ll have a &#8220;TikTok Shop&#8221; on the second tab on their profile, which users can view when they visit the page.</p>
<p>When their videos showing their products are viewed, there are &#8220;product anchors&#8221; embedded in the content. Clicking on these anchors will redirect the viewer to the product detail page where they can transact. In addition, brands can collaborate with TikTok influencers to promote their products through a new &#8220;TikTok Affiliate&#8221; program.</p>

<p>TikTok told TechCrunch the program is a test of its e-commerce solutions in Indonesia, and one of several product tests in the area of e-commerce.</p>
<h3>Consumer advocacy groups file FTC complaint against edtech app Prodigy</h3>
<p>A coalition of 20 consumer advocacy groups, led by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, have filed an FTC complaint against the popular edtech app Prodigy, which offers a math learning app for web and mobile. The app is designed much like modern-day freemium games, with math &#8220;battles&#8221; designed to improve math skills, grades and test scores.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges a variety of abuses, including how it aggressively pushes kids using the free version provided to schools to nag parents for the paid $59 annual subscription, which includes a richer gaming experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=768,558 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=680,494 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.06.46-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The groups also take issue with the app&#8217;s in-app rewards and badges &#8212; some of which are only available to paid users, including fancier loot boxes &#8212; saying these features cause division between those who pay and those who can&#8217;t. And it alleges that Prodigy&#8217;s claims about educational improvements don&#8217;t hold merit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2115507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg 1204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-4.07.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In response, Prodigy says it takes the concerns seriously, but over 95% of users play the game for free and the business model involving the paid membership is how free access is provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without this model, we would be required to put all of our educational content behind a paywall, which contradicts our mission of providing full access to fun and engaging math learning,&#8221; a company spokesperson said. &#8220;The alternative would be to generate revenue via advertising, which is not a model we believe best benefits or protects our users. We never show third-party ads on our platform, nor do we sell or lease any other user information to third parties,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The FTC has stepped up its enforcement over how apps targeting children can behave, with a focus on data collection practices and COPPA violations, which has resulted in fines for apps like TikTok and YouTube. This complaint, however, is not about children&#8217;s privacy, but rather how they&#8217;re being marketed to via edtech.</p>

<h3>Photos</h3>
<p><strong>YouTube star David Dobrik&#8217;s photo-sharing app Dispo, backed by a $4 million seed, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/02/17/david-dobriks-invite-only-photo-app-dispo-generates-some-unexpected-buzz/?sh=57fd393c7ed9">launched into private beta to a ton of buzz</a>.</strong> The app quickly maxed out TestFlight&#8217;s 10,000-person limit, instead of being the low-key beta debut the team had expected. Dispo&#8217;s gimmick is that users have to wait 24 hours to see the photos they snap.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p><strong>Microsoft xCloud, the game streaming service that lets users play Xbox games on Android tablets and phones, has begun testing a web version</strong>.

<p><strong>Apple demanded sensitive data from Valve to aid in its legal battle with Epic Games</strong>. The request included things like total yearly sales of apps and in-app products; annual ad revenues from Steam; annual revenues from Steam; annual earnings gross or net from Steam; and more. Apple also wanted the names of all Steam apps, price and IAP, and date range available.

<h3>Zillow&#8217;s update</h3>

<p>The updated version of <a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/3d-home/">Zillow&#8217;s 3D Home app</a> introduced new technology that combines into one interface 3D Home tours, listing photos and AI-generated floor plans. To create the floor plans and home tour, the app uses computer vision and machine learning on panoramic photos the agent or photographer captured using the app and a 360-degree camera. The app also leverages AI to predict things like room dimensions and square footage. Both the home tour and floor plan can then be automatically uploaded to the lists and added to a website, MLS or shared on email/social media.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, <span class="il">Zillow</span> 3D Home tours published on for-sale listings increased 255% during 2020 as customers used it as a safer way to tour properties, the company also noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week and the biggest story in a sea of big stories continues to center on SPACs, these blank-check companies that raise capital through IPOs expressly to acquire a privately held company and take it public. But some industry watchers as starting to wonder: Is the party just getting started, with more early guests still trickling in? Have we reached the party&#8217;s peak, with the music still thumping? Or did someone just quietly barf in the corner, an indicator it&#8217;s time to wrap things up before something worse happens?</p>
<p>It certainly feels like things are in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-boom-visualized-in-one-chart-11612962000">full swing</a>. Just today, B Capital, the venture firm cofounded by Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844740/000114036121005525/nt10020541x1_s1.htm">registered plans</a> to raise a $300 million SPAC. Mike Cagney, the fintech entrepreneur who founded SoFI and more recently founded Figure, a fintech company in both the home equity and blockchain space, raised <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77969/Fintech-SPAC-Figure-Acquisition-I-prices-$250-million-IPO;-led-by-former-So">$250 million</a> for his SPAC. Even Michael Dell has made the leap, with his family office registering plans this afternoon to raise a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-msd-capital-ipo/blank-check-firm-led-by-ex-goldman-banker-aims-for-500-million-ipo-idUSKBN2AJ2LC">$500 million</a> blank-check company.</p>
<p>Altogether, according to Renaissance Capital, 16 blank-check companies raised $3.4 billion this week, and new filers continue to flood into the IPO pipeline, with <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78016/US-IPO-Weekly-Recap-The-IPO-market-takes-its-annual-February-break-in-a-1-I">45 SPACs</a> submitting initial filings this week (compared with 10 traditional IPO filings). Perhaps it’s no wonder that we’re starting to see headlines like one in Yahoo News just yesterday titled, &#8220;<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-some-spac-investors-may-get-burned-192802863.html">Why some SPAC investors may get burned.&#8221;</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, such headlines could gum up the SPAC machine. So argues Ivana Naumovska, an assistant professor at INSEAD, in a new Harvard Business Review piece titled, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/the-spac-bubble-is-about-to-burst">The SPAC Bubble is About to Burst</a>.”</p>
<p>Naumovska points to research showing that when more people adopt a practice, it will become increasingly widespread due to growing awareness and legitimacy. Yet when it comes to something that’s more controversial &#8212; which it could be argued that SPACs are &#8212; outsider concern and skepticism also grows as the practice becomes more widely used. Thus are born headlines like that one in Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Naumovska has studied this phenomenon before, focusing on earlier reverse mergers that, as she notes, &#8220;surged in the mid-2000s, outnumbering IPOs in some years, and peaked in 2010, before falling off a cliff in 2011.&#8221; She says she and fellow researchers collected a plethora of data on the use of reverse mergers and market responses to them, including how the media evaluated such vehicles. Of the 267 articles published between 2001 and 2012, she says, 6 were positive, 148 were neutral, 113 were negative.</p>
<p>Notably and unsurprisingly, the negative articles grew as the number of reverse merger transactions involving firms with relatively low reputations increased. And as the media picked up on these companies, so did regulators, and with investors, regulators, and the media feeding off one another’s signals, the party came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, most of the coverage around SPACs right now remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/is-anything-too-big-to-be-spacd/">neutral</a>. If business reporters are privately skeptical of SPACs, they are reserving judgment, possibly because save for some highly concerning cases &#8212;  like when the electric truck startup Nikola was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns.html">accused of fraud</a> &#8212; there isn’t much to criticize yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to judge many of the SPACs raised over the last six months, as they have yet to announce their targets (SPACS have two years from the time they raise funds to zero in on a target, or else give back their IPO proceeds).</p>
<p>The argument that most investors have for creating a SPAC &#8212; which is that a lot of so-called unicorn companies are ready to be publicly traded &#8212; resonates, too, given how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2020/02/26/why-more-businesses-are-choosing-to-stay-private/?sh=18f56c706400">bloated</a> the private market has become.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some of the merger deals that critics have long expected would begin to unravel have not, like Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company that kicked off SPAC mania when it went public in the <a href="https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-goes-public-nyse-stock-exchange.html">fall of 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Branson founded the company in 2004 in order to fly passengers on suborbital spaceflights, but even after putting off plans yet again to attempt a rocket-powered flight to suborbital space last week, its shares &#8212; which have more than doubled since January&#8211; remain in the figurative stratosphere. (The company, which reported almost no revenue last year, is currently valued at $12 billion.)</p>
<p>Other offerings haven&#8217;t gone quite as smoothly. Clover Health, a health insurance company that, like Virgin Galactic, was taken public via a SPAC organized by famed investor Chamath Palihapitiya, is &#8220;facing a confluence of existential threats&#8221; to its business, as observed in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2021/02/17/billionaire-clover-health-ceo-vivek-garipallis-expletive-ridden-tirade/?sh=56a63464140a">deep dive</a> by Forbes.</p>
<p>Among others poking into its business practices are the The Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the short-seller Hindenburg Research, which has accused it of making misleading claims. (Clover has rebutted the allegations, but Forbes says it is still facing at least three class-action lawsuits over its failure to disclose ahead of its IPO that the DOJ was investigating the company.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get it,&#8221; said skeptic Steve Jurvetson last month in conversation with this editor of the SPAC frenzy. The veteran venture capitalist, who sits on the board of SpaceX, said there are &#8220;some good companies [being taken public]. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; they aren&#8217;t all fraudulent.&#8221; But many are &#8220;early-stage venture companies,&#8221; he noted, &#8220;and they don&#8217;t need to meet the forecasting requirements that the SEC normally requires of an IPO, so [SPAC sponsors are] specifically looking for companies that don&#8217;t have any operating numbers to show [because they] can make any forecasts they want . . .That&#8217;s the whole racket.&#8221;</p>
<p>If others agree with Jurvetson, they hesitate to say so publicly. For one thing, plenty of VCs would be happy to see their portfolio companies taken public however possible, including via SPAC. Others who haven&#8217;t formed SPACs of their own are reserving the right to consider them down the road.</p>
<p>Ed Sim of Boldstart Ventures in New York is one of few VCs in recent months to say outright, when asked, that his firm isn&#8217;t considering raising a SPAC any time soon. &#8220;<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7976041">I have zero interest in that honestly</a>,&#8221; says Sim. &#8220;You can come back to me if you see my name or Boldstart [affiliated] with a SPAC two years from now,&#8221; he adds, laughing.</p>
<p>Many more investors stress that when it comes to SPACs, it&#8217;s all about who is sponsoring what. Among them is Kevin Mayer, the former Disney exec and, briefly, the CEO of the social network TikTok. In a call yesterday, Mayer advanced the idea that there are &#8220;many fewer public companies now than there were 10 years ago, so there is a need for supplying another way to go public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayer has a vested interest in SPACs. Just yesterday, along with former Disney colleague Tom Staggs, he registered plans for a<a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/77960/TMT-focused-SPAC-Forest-Road-Acquisition-II-files-for-a-$300-million-IPO"> second SPAC, </a>after it was announced earlier this month that their <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/forest-road-spac-kevin-mayer-tom-staggs-buys-digital-fitness-group-beachbody-company-1234691065/">first SPAC</a> will be used to take public the digital fitness specialist Beachbody. But Mayer also argues that not every SPAC should be judged by the same yardstick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I think it&#8217;s overdone? Sure, everyone and their brother is now getting to a SPAC, so yeah, that does seem a bit ridiculous. But I think . . . the wheat will be separated from the chaff very, very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may need to be if SPACs are to endure as a lasting way to pull privately held companies into the public markets.</p>
<p>While the mechanism has won over powerful adherents, working against SPACs are numbers that are starting to trickle in and that don&#8217;t look so great.</p>
<p>Last week, for example, Bloomberg Law shared its analysis of the companies that went public as a result of a merger with a SPAC dating back to Jan. 1, 2019 (and for which at least one month of post-merger performance data is available). In it, 14 out of 24 reported a depreciation in value as of one month following the completion of the merger, and one-third of the companies reported a year-to-date depreciation in value.</p>
<p>The number of securities lawsuits filed by SPAC stockholders post-merger is also on the rise, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-post-merger-spac-performance-is-mixed">noted the outlet</a>.</p>
<p>Given the astonishing rate at which SPACs are now being formed anyway, the question of whether the phenomenon is sustainable is one that more people are naturally <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/11/19/a-sober-look-at-spacs/">beginning to ask</a>.</p>
<p>For her part, Professor Naumovska thinks she already knows the answer.</p>
