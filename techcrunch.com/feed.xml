										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are big investment firms, and then there are big investment firms. <a href="https://www.brookfield.com/">Brookfield Asset Management</a>, the Toronto-based,122-year-old outfit whose current market cap is $63 billion and that oversees $600 billion in assets, clearly falls into the latter camp. Think real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity, and credit. If it falls into a defined asset class, Brookfield probably has it in its portfolio.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also true of venture capital, though venture is new enough to Brookfield that founders who might like its capital are still getting the memo. Indeed, it was a little less than four years ago that Brookfield Technology Partners began investing off the company&#8217;s balance sheet and soon after recruited Josh Raffaelli &#8212; a Stanford MBA who cut his teeth as a principal with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, then spent another five years with Silver Lake &#8212; to lead the practice.</p>
<p>Its existence came as a surprise to him, actually. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a tech investor in Silicon Valley,&#8221; says Raffaelli. &#8220;My entire professional career has been in a 15-minute drive from the house I grew up in. And I had never heard about Brookfield before they started this practice because it&#8217;s in businesses. It&#8217;s in real estate. It has done things that are not generally tech-enabled.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not until fairly recently, that is. Raffaelli and his 11-person team have not only made dozens of bets since then, but they’re currently investing out of a pool of capital that features third party capital in addition to that of Brookfield — which is a first. As for what they are looking for, the idea is help Brookfield reimagine how its many office towers, malls and other real estate might be used or developed or leased or insured. It’s to make Brookfield smarter, better prepared, and more profitable. In return, the startups get industry expertise &#8212; and a major customer in Brookfield.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Renewable investment wave continues as solar lending company Loanpal raises $800 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/renewable-investment-wave-continues-as-solar-lending-company-loanpal-raises-800-million/embed/#?secret=qlP6vCjajt" data-secret="qlP6vCjajt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, its bets have varied widely, as with <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/iot-security-startup-armis-doubles-valuation-to-2b-with-125m-round">Armis</a>, an IoT startup focused on unmanaged device security; <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/renewable-investment-wave-continues-as-solar-lending-company-loanpal-raises-800-million/">Loanpal</a>, a point-of-sale payment platform for solar and other home efficiency products; and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/carbon-health-raises-100-million-with-plans-to-expand-pop-up-clinics-ahead-of-covid-19-vaccination-programs/">Carbon Health</a>, a primary care company that blends real-world and virtual visits. &#8220;&#8221;We&#8217;re getting our themes effectively from the Brookfield ecosystem,&#8221; Raffaelli says.</p>
<p>Pulling back the curtain a bit more, Raffaelli says his team writes checks from $25 million to $50 million dollars and that they look for companies with $10 million in revenue that are seeing top-line year-over-year growth of more than 100%. In terms of pacing, they jump into roughly one new deal per quarter.</p>
<p>The fund is also independent and has its own custom committee, but that the committee is made up of the senior managing partners from each line of Brookfield&#8217;s businesses. (&#8220;These are the people that actually help us translate our investment themes that we&#8217;re generating here,&#8221; Raffaelli notes.)</p>
<p>To highlight how the operation works, Raffaelli points to <a href="https://www.latch.com/">Latch</a>, a smart access software business that announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">last month</a> that it&#8217;s using a blank-check company backed by the real estate giant Tishman Speyer to become publicly traded. Brookfield owns roughly 70,000 multifamily units in North America, &#8220;so we have a lot of doors that need a lot of locks,&#8221; Raffaelli says. Latch, of course, is not the only smart access lock out there, so Brookfield ran &#8220;what was almost like a mini [proposal process], reaching out to all different companies in the market to understand how they compete,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>It was a &#8220;six-month exercise,&#8221; but ultimately, his group led Latch&#8217;s Series B round in 2018 and since then, Brookfield was bought about 7,000 blocks from the business. It&#8217;s a meaningful difference, considering that when Brookfield first invested, the company had less than $20 million in bookings and those 7,000 locks have since brought in an additional $10 million to $15 million in revenue, Raffaelli says. &#8220;When we buy a lot of things at that stage of a company,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;we&#8217;re meaningfully enhancing their trajectory.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="biH9QGBgLo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/">Smart lock maker Latch teams with real estate firm to go public via SPAC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Smart lock maker Latch teams with real estate firm to go public via SPAC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/smart-lock-maker-latch-teams-with-real-estate-firm-to-go-public-via-spac/embed/#?secret=biH9QGBgLo" data-secret="biH9QGBgLo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not a foolproof strategy, doubling down. If Latch&#8217;s locks turned out to be lemons (they haven&#8217;t), Brookfield would be out a big check along with that capital expenditure. It&#8217;s why Brookfield takes its time, says Raffaelli, adding that if he has done his job right, his team is involved with a company well before it is raising a round and shown already that it is a &#8220;strategic partner that has another lever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, Raffaelli says that while the commercial real estate market has been hard hit by the pandemic, it has, counterintuitively, been a productive time for his group given the stronger incentive it has given the real estate world to adopt tech tools faster. Among the bets about which Raffaelli sounds most excited right now is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.vts.com/">VTS</a>, for example, a leasing and asset management platform that can show properties remotely, and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://deliverr.com/">Deliverr</a>, an e-commerce fulfillment startup that Raffaelli describes as &#8220;Amazon Prime for everybody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Raffaelli convincingly argues that while the use case for a lot of real estate is changing,  the so-called built world remains Brookfield&#8217;s strongest competitive advantage given the size of its footprint.  The way he sees it, its options going forward are plentiful. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking at retail locations becoming ghost kitchens; you&#8217;re looking at retail locations turning into distribution and logistics facilities. We can turn physical locations into healthcare sites for [our portfolio company] Carbon Health, and our mall locations into locations for urgent care and primary care clinics for testing and vaccinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will never be a completely seamless transition. Brookfield has to be &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; given the pandemic and its devastating impacts, too. But Raffaelli comes across as excited in conversation nonetheless. The idea of turning physical real estate into a &#8220;mechanism for change within technology businesses,&#8221; adds Raffaelli, is a &#8220;very powerful place to be.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://raenabeauty.com/">Raena</a> was founded in 2019 to create personal care brands with top social media influencers. After several launches, however, the Singapore-based startup noticed an interesting trend: customers were ordering batches of products from Raena every week and reselling them on social media and e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Tokopedia. Last year, the company decided to focus on those sellers, and pivoted to social commerce.</p>
<p>Today Raena announced it has raised a Series A of $9 million, co-led by Alpha Wave Incubation and Alpha JWC Ventures, with participation from AC Ventures and returning investors Beenext, Beenos and Strive. Its last funding announcement was a $1.82 million seed round announced in July 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Raena raises $1.82 million to help influencers in Southeast Asia launch their own consumer brands&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/raena-raises-1-82-million-to-help-influencers-in-southeast-asia-launch-their-own-consumer-brands/embed/#?secret=oazPaFDkap" data-secret="oazPaFDkap" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After interviewing people who had set up online stores with products from Raena, the company&#8217;s team realized that sellers&#8217; earnings potential was capped because they were paying retail prices for their inventory.</p>
<p>They also saw that even though new C2C retail models, like social commerce, are gaining popularity, the beauty industry&#8217;s supply chain hasn&#8217;t kept up. Sellers usually need to order minimum quantities, which makes it harder for people to start their own businesses, Raena co-founder Sreejita Deb told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, you have to block your capital upfront. It&#8217;s difficult for individual sellers or micro-enterpreneurs to work with the old supply chain and categories like beauty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Raena decided to pivot to serve those entrepreneurs. The company provides a catalog that includes mostly Japanese and Korean skincare and beauty brands. For those brands, Raena represents a way to enter new markets like Indonesia, which the startup estimates has $20 billion market opportunity.</p>
<p>Raena resellers, who are mostly women between 18 to 34-years-old in Indonesia and Malaysia, pick what items they want to feature on their social media accounts. Most use TikTok or Instagram for promotion, and set up online stores on Shopee or Tokopedia. But they don’t have to carry inventory. When somebody buys a product from a Raena reseller, the reseller orders it from Raena, which ships it directly to the customer.</p>
<p>This drop-shipping model means resellers make higher margins. Since they don&#8217;t have to buy their inventory, it also dramatically lowers the barrier to launching a small business. Even though Raena&#8217;s pivot to social commerce coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, Deb said it grew its revenue 50 times between January and December 2020. The platform now has more than 1,500 resellers, and claims a 60% seller retention rate after six months on the platform.</p>
<p>She attributes Raena&#8217;s growth to several factors, including the increase in online shopping during lockdowns and people looking for ways to earn additional income during the pandemic. While forced to stay at home, people also <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/social-media-habits-during-pandemic">began spending more time online</a>, especially on the social media platforms that Raena resellers use.</p>
<p>Raena also benefited from its focus on skincare. Though many retail categories, including color cosmetics, took a hit, <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/beauty/the-beauty-trends-customers-are-buying-during-covid-19">skincare products proved resilient</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw skincare had higher margins, and there are certain markets that are experts at formulating and producing skincare products, and demand for those products in other parts of the world,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve continued being a skincare company and because that is a category we had insight into, it was our first entry point into this social selling model as well. 90% of our sales are skincare,&#8221; Deb added. &#8220;Our top-selling products are serums, toners, essences, which makes a lot of sense because people are in their homes and have more time to dedicate to their skincare routines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social commerce, which allows people to earn a side income (or even a full-time income), by leveraging their social media networks, has taken off in several Asian markets. In China, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">Pinduoduo has become a formidable rival</a> to Alibaba through its group-selling model and focus on fresh produce. In India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/meesho-india">Meesho resellers</a> sell products like clothing through social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also gaining traction in Southeast Asia, with gross merchandise value growing threefold during the first half of 2020, <a href="https://ikala.tv/news/social-commerce-surges-in-southeast-asia/">according to iKala</a>.</p>
<p>Deb said one of the ways Raena is different from other social commerce companies is that most of its resellers are selling to customers they don’t know, instead of family and friends. Many already had TikTok or Instagram profiles focused on beauty and skincare, and had developed reputations for being knowledgeable about products.</p>
<p>As Raena develops, it plans to hire a tech team to build tools that will simplify the process of managing orders and also strike deals directly with manufacturers to increase profit margins for resellers. The funding will be used to increase its team from 15 to over 100 over the next three months, and it plans to enter more Southeast Asian markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffee and doughnut giant, has raised a new round of funding for its Chinese venture. The investment is led by Sequoia China with participation from Tencent, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/tim-hortons-eyes-china-coffee-drinkers-with-tencent-investment/">digital partner in China</a>, and Eastern Bell Capital. The round comes two years after Tim Hortons made its foray into China&#8217;s booming coffee industry.</p>
<p>Tim Hortons didn&#8217;t disclose the amount of its latest fundraise but noted in a <a href="https://weibo.com/6969784101/K3G7jvUI7?from=page_1006066969784101_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">social media post</a> that the proceeds will be used for opening more stores, building its digital infrastructure, brand presence, and more.</p>
<p>Tencent, the Chinese social media and entertainment behemoth, first backed the 57-year-old Canadian coffee chain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/tim-hortons-eyes-china-coffee-drinkers-with-tencent-investment/">last May</a>. At the time the tie-up was seen as Tencent&#8217;s move to counter archrival Alibaba&#8217;s alliance with Starbucks to deliver coffee and help the American coffee titan go digital in China.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tim Horton&#8217;s collaboration with the WeChat parent is in a similar vein. It has so far accumulated three million members through its WeChat mini program, a type of lightweight app that runs within the instant messenger. To appeal to young Chinese consumers, Tim Hortons opened <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU2MTM3NjE5Mg==&amp;mid=2247485088&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=21ce8625300c131ca23a8797a60a3f8d&amp;chksm=fc78f80fcb0f7119766b4e140910a421b2fcc18ea945190febfbdde5b0a2540ed23735eabf9c&amp;scene=21#wechat_redirect">an esports-themed cafe</a> with Tencent, China&#8217;s biggest gaming company.</p>
<p>Two years into operating in China, Tim Hortons says it has reached storefront-level profitability with a footprint of 150 locations across 10 major cities. It plans to add more than 200 locations in 2021 and reach 1,500 stores nationwide in the next few years.</p>
<p>The dramatic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/chinas-luckin-coffee-raises-up-to-651m-in-upsized-us-ipo/">rise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/following-multiple-scandals-including-luckin-coffee-nasdaq-ready-to-tighten-rules-on-ipo-listings/">fall</a> of coffee delivery startup Luckin brought the prospects of China&#8217;s coffee market to the forefront. Despite the investment frenzy around Luckin and other coffee businesses, coffee drinking still has a relatively low penetration in China compared to countries like the United States and Germany. On the other hand, coffee consumption is growing at a much faster rate of 15% in China, well above the global average of 2%, and is projected to reach 1 trillion yuan ($150 million) in 2025, according to a 2020 <a href="https://pdf.dfcfw.com/pdf/H3_AP202004021377475527_1.pdf?1585842837000.pdf">report</a> by Dongxing Securities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major VC firm has closed two major rounds, underscoring the long-term confidence investors continue to have for backing privately held companies in the tech sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early-stage VC firm <a href="http://www.bvp.com">Bessemer Venture Partners</a> announced Thursday the close of two new funds totaling $3.3 billion that it will be using to back early-stage startups as well as growth rounds for more mature companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Redwood City-based firm closed BVP XI with $2.475 billion and BVP Century II with $825 million in total commitments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With BVP XI, it plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on early-stage companies spanning enterprise, consumer, healthcare and frontier technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its Century II fund is aimed at backing growth-stage companies that Bessemer believes “will define the next century,” and will include both follow-on rounds for existing portfolio companies and investments in new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BVP XI marks Bessemer’s largest fund in its 110-year history. In October 2018, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the firm </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/bessemer-venture-partners-has-a-brand-new-1-85b-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brought in $1.85 billion</span></a> f<span style="font-weight: 400;">or its tenth flagship VC fund. This latest fund is its fifth consecutive billion-dollar fund, based on </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/10134-73"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9TaNH39Tir"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/tcv-closes-record-4b-fund-to-invest-in-e-commerce-fintech-edtech-travel-and-more/">TCV closes record $4B fund to invest in e-commerce, fintech, edtech, travel and more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TCV closes record $4B fund to invest in e-commerce, fintech, edtech, travel and more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/tcv-closes-record-4b-fund-to-invest-in-e-commerce-fintech-edtech-travel-and-more/embed/#?secret=9TaNH39Tir" data-secret="9TaNH39Tir" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being founded more than 100 years ago, Bessemer didn’t actually enter the venture business until 1965. It’s known for its investments in LinkedIn, Blue Apron and many others, with a current portfolio that includes PagerDuty, Shippo, Electric and DocuSign. Exits include Twitch and Shopify, among many others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more money than ever before available for backing startups, the challenge now for VCs is to see how and if they can find (and invest in) whatever will define the next generation of tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As venture capitalists, we pay too much attention to pattern recognition and matching when in reality, the biggest opportunities exist where those patterns break,” the firm wrote in a</span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/news/backing-entrepreneurs-with-3-3b-in-new-funds"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog post </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">today. “Our job is to make perceptive bets on the future, especially those that others will dismiss and ridicule. We are fundamental optimists and strong believers in the power of innovation; our life’s work is putting our reputation, time, and money to help entrepreneurs realize a different future. They’re the ones pioneering something entirely new and obscure &#8212; a technology, a business model, a category.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to announcing the new funds, Bessemer also revealed today that it’s brought on five new partners, including</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/jeff-blackburn/"> Jeff Blackburn</a>, who joins after a 22-year career at Amazon, alongside the promotion of existing investors </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/mary-donofrio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary D&#8217;Onofrio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/mike-droesch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Droesch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/tess-hatch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tess Hatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/andrew-hedin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Hedin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently at Amazon, Blackburn served as senior vice president of worldwide business development, where he oversaw dozens of Amazon’s minority investments and more than 100 acquisitions across all business lines &#8212; including retail, Kindle, Echo, Alexa, FireTV, advertising, music, streaming audio &amp; video and Amazon Web Services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having been part of Amazon for more than two decades, I’m excited to begin a new chapter helping customer-focused founders build breakthrough companies,” said Blackburn in a written statement. &#8220;I’ve known the Bessemer team for many years and have long admired their strategic vision and success backing early-stage ventures.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest changes, Bessemer now has 21 partners and more than 45 investors, advisors and platform “team members” located in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston, London, Tel Aviv, Bangalore and Beijing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Bessemer, there’s no corner office or consensus; every partner has the choice, independently, to pen a check. This kind of accountability and autonomy means a founder is teaming up with a partner and board director who thoroughly understands your business and can respond quickly and decisively,” the firm’s blog post states.</span></p>
<p>Bessemer&#8217;s task is all the more difficult because there is more competition than ever before to get into the best deals.</p>
<p>TCV closed on a record $4 billion fund to invest in e-commerce, fintech, edtech, travel and more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/tcv-closes-record-4b-fund-to-invest-in-e-commerce-fintech-edtech-travel-and-more/">in late January</a>.</p>
<p>Last November, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/a16z-is-now-managing-16-5-billion-after-announcing-two-new-funds/">closed a pair of funds</a> totaling $4.5 billion. The firm raised $1.3 billion for an early-stage fund focused on consumer, enterprise and fintech, and closed a $3.2 billion growth-stage fund for later-stage investments.</p>

<p>And, last April, <a href="http://insightpartners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insight</a>, the firm that has backed the likes of Twitter and Shopify and invests across a range of consumer and enterprise startups, announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/insight-closes-9-5b-fund-to-help-support-portfolio-companies-through-the-pandemic-crunch/">closed a fund of $9.5 billion</a>, money it said it would be using to support startups and “scale-ups” (larger and older startups that are still private) in the coming months.</p>
<p>Although BVP is one of the older firms in the valley, there has been a new wave of investors, some like SoftBank with very deep pockets, and others will less money but a lot of credibility, so it will be interesting to see how these next two funds play out for the firm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Newsela, a SaaS platform for K-12 instructional material backed <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newsela/company_financials">by the likes</a> of TCV, Kleiner Perkins, Reach Capital and Owl Ventures, announced today that it has raised $100 million in a Series D round. The financing was led by new investor Franklin Templeton, and brings Newsela’s valuation to $1 billion. The new round is larger than the aggregate of Newsela’s prior capital raised to date.</p>
<p>“Hitting $1 billion [in valuation] doesn’t change a thing,” Newsela CEO Matthew Gross told TechCrunch. But the startup is joining Quizlet, ApplyBoard and CourseHero as companies within the sector that have hit the unicorn mark as remote education <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth/">continues to gain traction. </a></p>
<p>Newsela has created a platform that strings together a number of different third-party content, such as primary source documents or the latest National Geographic articles. Gross defines it as “material that isn’t purpose-built for education, [but] purpose-built for being interesting and informative.” If Newsela is doing its job right, the content can replace textbooks within a classroom altogether, while helping teachers give fresh, personalized material.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Textbooks are dead in classrooms, but are well-and-live in district purchasing,” Gross said. The startup is on a mission to distribute its product better, and the money will be used to get it into more classrooms. Part of this, Gross explains, is telling teachers what else it can provide along with textbooks. Analytics has become a big part of Newsela’s business, as remote learning hurts student engagement.</p>
<p>The startup’s paid product is between $6 to $14 per student, which contrasts with textbooks that can cost a school $20 to $40 per student “even on an annualized basis.”</p>
<p>Like other edtech companies, Newsela offered its product for free in the beginning of the pandemic, which gave it a healthy bump of new users.</p>
<p>Newsela estimates that gross bookings have grown 115% over the pandemic, and that revenue grew 81%. It declined to share revenue numbers or if it has hit profitability. There will be more than 11 million students using Newsela licensing by the end of 2021, Gross said.</p>
<p>Newsela estimates that two-thirds of public schools in the United States are using their platform, likely aided by school district <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/edtech-startups-find-demand-from-an-unlikely-customer-public-schools/">flexibility that has grown amid the pandemic.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AT&amp;T just <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225006201/en/ATT-TPG-to-Form-New-Entity-to-Operate-ATT’s-U.S.-Video-Unit">announced an agreement</a> with private equity firm TPG that will turn DirecTV into a standalone company, albeit one that&#8217;s still majority owned by the telecom giant.</p>
<p>Specifically, AT&amp;T says it will own 70% of the new company, while TPG owns 30%. This transaction values DirecTV at $16.25 billion — a dramatic decline from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/24/forty-eight-point-five-billion/">the $48.5 billion that AT&amp;T paid</a> to acquire the pay TV provider in 2015, part of a wave of telecom-media acquisitions. (Verizon owns TechCrunch thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/">its acquisition of AOL</a>.)</p>
<p>Even with new offerings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/directv-nows-rebranding-to-att-tv-now-is-officially-rolling-out/">like AT&amp;T TV</a> (which will be part of the standalone company, along with the DirecTV and U-Verse services), pay TV subscriptions have been declining, with AT&amp;T reporting a net loss of 617,000 premium video subscribers <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4_earnings_2020.html">in its most recent quarter</a>. AT&amp;T is trying to point out the positive trends in the numbers by noting that &#8220;it hit its peak level of subscriber losses in 2019&#8221; and that &#8220;premium video net losses had improved sequentially for five straight quarters.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T made an even bigger acquisition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/15/att-completes-its-acquisition-of-time-warner/">with Time Warner</a> (now known as WarnerMedia), and its TV ambitions seem to be focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">the streaming service HBO Max</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the pay-TV industry continues to evolve, forming a new entity with TPG to operate the U.S. video business separately provides the flexibility and dedicated management focus needed to continue meeting the needs of a high-quality customer base and managing the business for profitability,&#8221; said AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey in a statement. &#8220;TPG is the right partner for this transaction and creating a new entity is the right way to structure and manage the video business for optimum value creation.”</p>
<p>The company said the transaction should close in the second half of 2021. The combined entity is expected to pay AT&amp;T $7.8 billion, which the telecom company will use to reduce debt. AT&amp;T also said that when the transaction closes, DirecTV&#8217;s CEO will be Bill Morrow, currently CEO of AT&amp;T’s U.S. video unit.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-again-exploring-a-deal-for-directv-11598645254">reported last year</a> that AT&amp;T was exploring a deal for DirecTV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boating is a hobby steeped in history and tradition — and so is the industry and those that support it. With worldwide connectivity, electric boats, and other technological changes dragging the sector out of old habits, <a href="https://getorca.com/">Orca</a> aims to replace the outdated interfaces by which people navigate with a hardware-software combo as slick as any other modern consumer tech.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a boater, and I know at least some of you are, you&#8217;re probably familiar with two different ways of chart-plotting, or tracking your location and route: the one attached to your boat and the one in your pocket.</p>
<p>The one on your boat is clunky and old-fashioned, like the GPS interface on a years-old budget sedan. The one in your pocket is better and faster — but the phone isn&#8217;t exactly seaworthy and the app drains your battery with a quickness.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orca is a Norwegian startup from veterans of the boating and chart-plotters that leapfrogs existing products with a built-from-scratch modern interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;The industry hasn&#8217;t changed in the last 20 years — you have three players who own 80 percent of the business,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Jorge Sevillano. &#8220;For them, it&#8217;s very hard to think of how software creates value. All these devices are built on a user interface that&#8217;s 10-15 years old; think about a Tomtom, lots of menus, lots of clicks. This business hasn&#8217;t had its iPhone moment, where it had to rethink its entire design. So we thought: let&#8217;s start with a blank slate and build a new experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>CTO and co-founder Kristian Fallro started working on something like this years ago, and his company was acquired by Navico, one of the big players Sevillano refers to. But they didn&#8217;t seem to want to move forward with the ideas, and so he and the others formed Orca to pursue them. Their first complete product <a href="https://getorca.com/store">opened up for pre-orders</a> this week.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xek34Bv8Vro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge up until now has been that you need a combination of hardware and software, so the barrier to entry was very, very high,&#8221; Fallro explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very protected industry — and it&#8217;s too small for Apple and Google and the big boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now with a combination of the right hardware and a totally rebuilt software stack, they think they can steal a march on the dominant companies and be ready for the inevitable new generation of boaters who can&#8217;t stand to use the old tech any more. Shuttling an SD card to and from the in-boat system and your computer to update charts? Inputting destinations via directional pad? Using a separate mobile app to check weather and tides that might bear on your route? Not exactly cutting edge.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRl56XRsX48?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The Orca system comprises a ruggedized industrial tablet sourced from Samsung, an off the shelf marine quality mounting arm, a custom-designed interface for quick attachment and charging, and a computing base unit that connects to the boat&#8217;s own sensors like sonar and GPS over the NMEA 2000 protocol. It&#8217;s all made to be as good or better than anything you&#8217;d find on a boat today.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to many solutions out there. But Orca has rebuilt everything from the ground up as a modern mobile app with all the conveniences and connections you&#8217;d expect. Routing is instantaneous and accurate, on maps that are clear and readable as those on Google and Apple Maps but clearly still of the nautical variety. Weather and tide reports are integrated, as is marine traffic. It all runs on Android or iOS, so you can also use your phone, send routes or places of interest to the main unit, and vice versa.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118039" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2118039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg" alt="Several devices showing the Orca chart-plotting interface." width="1024" height="543" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg 1871w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=1536,814 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/orca-devices.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2118039" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orca</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We can build new services that chart plotters can&#8217;t even dream of including,&#8221; said Sevillano. &#8220;With the latest tide report and wind, or if there&#8217;s a commercial ship going in your way, we can update your range and route. We do updates every week with new features and bug fixes. We can iterate and adapt to user feedback faster than anyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>These improvements to the most central system of the boat mean the company has ambitions for coming years beyond simply replacing the ageing gadgets at the helm.</p>
<p>Information collected from the boat itself is also used to update the maps in near real time — depending on what your craft is monitoring, it could be used for alerting others or authorities, for example if you encounter major waves or dangerous levels of chemicals, or detect an obstacle where none is recorded. &#8220;The Waze of the seas,&#8221; they suggested. &#8220;Our goal is to become the marine data company. The opportunities for boaters, industries related to the sea, and society are immense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being flexible about the placement and features means they hope to integrate directly with boats, becoming the built-in OS for new models. That&#8217;s especially important for the up-and-coming category of electric boats, which sort of by definition buck the old traditions and tend to attract tech-savvy early adopters.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zin Boats reinvents the electric speedboat in a bid to become the Tesla of the sea&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/embed/#?secret=Sh1OxFh7CF" data-secret="Sh1OxFh7CF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing people take what works on land taking it to sea. They all have the same challenge though, the biggest problem is range anxiety — and it&#8217;s even worse on the water,&#8221; said Fallro. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of these manufacturers and we&#8217;re finding that building a boat is hard but building that navigation experience is even harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether that&#8217;s entirely true probably depends on your boat-building expertise, but it&#8217;s certainly the case that figuring out an electric boat&#8217;s effective range is a devilishly difficult problem. Even after building a new boat from starting principles and advanced physical simulations to be efficient and predictable, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">such as Zin Boats did</a>, the laws of physics and how watercraft work mean even the best estimate has to be completely revised every few seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figuring out range at sea is very hard, and we think we&#8217;re one of the best out there. So we want to provide boat manufacturers a software stack with integrated navigation that helps them solve the range anxiety problem their users have,&#8221; said Fallro.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems likely that prospective purchasers of such a craft would be more tempted to close the deal if they knew there was a modern and responsive OS that not only accurately tracked range but provided easy, real-time access to potential charge points and other resources. Sure, you could use your phone — and many do these days because the old chart plotters attached to their boats are so limited. But the point is that with Orca you won&#8217;t be tempted to.</p>
<p>The full device combo of computing core, mount, and tablet costs €1,449, with the core alone selling for €449, with a considerable discount for early bird pre-orders. (For people buying new boats, these numbers may as well be rounding errors.)</p>
<p>Fallro said Orca is operating with funding (of an unspecified amount) from Atomico and Nordic VC firm Skyfall Ventures, as well as angel investors including Kahoot co-founder Johan Brand. The company has its work cut out for it simply in fulfilling the orders it has collected (they are doing a brisk trade, Fallro intimated) before moving on to adding features and updating regularly as promised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, a provider of cloud computing services to SMBs, filed to go public. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol &#8220;DOCN.&#8221;</p>
<p>DigitalOcean&#8217;s offering comes amidst a hot streak for tech IPOs, and valuations that are stretched by historical norms. The cloud hosting company was joined by Coinbase in filing its numbers publicly today.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			DigitalOcean&#8217;s offering comes amidst a hot streak for tech IPOs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, unlike the cryptocurrency exchange, DigitalOcean intends to raise capital through its offering. Its S-1 filing lists a $100 million placeholder number, a figure that will update when the company announces an IPO price range target.</p>
<p>This morning let&#8217;s explore the company&#8217;s financials briefly, and then ask ourselves what its results can tell us about the cloud market as a whole.</p>
<h2>DigitalOcean&#8217;s financial results</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered DigitalOcean with some frequency in recent years, including its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/digitalocean-layoffs/">early-2020 layoffs</a>, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability/">early-2020 $100 million debt raise </a>and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z/">$50 million investment from May of the same year</a> that prior investors Access Industries and Andreessen Horowitz participated in.</p>
<p>From those pieces we knew that the company had reportedly reached $200 million in revenue during 2018, $250 million in 2019 and that DigitalOcean had expected to reach an annualized run rate of $300 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Those numbers held up well. Per <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1582961/000119312521055798/d898181ds1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>, DigitalOcean generated $203.1 million in 2018 revenue, $254.8 million in 2019 and $318.4 million in 2020. The company closed 2020 out with a self-calculated $357 million in annual run rate.</p>
<p>During its recent years of growth, DigitalOcean has managed to lose modestly increasing amounts of money, calculated using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and non-GAAP profit (adjusted EBITDA) in rising quantities. Observe the rising disconnect:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://anchorage.com">Anchorage</a> has raised an $80 million Series C funding round led by GIC, also known as Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Lux and Indico are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>The thinking behind this funding round is quite simple. Some companies, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla</a> or Square, have recently chosen to invest in cryptocurrencies. They’re converting a small portion of their cash balance into cryptocurrencies. Some investors choose to invest in companies that help you add cryptocurrencies to your cash balance — Anchorage is one of them.</p>
<p>The startup originally offered a custody solution. It lets you keep your cryptocurrencies safe for you so that you don’t have to take care of the wallets and their public and private keys. But more recently, Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting a thumbs-up sign from regulators should definitely help when it comes to confidence. Institutional investors are looking for trusty crypto partners to dip their toes into the crypto waters.</p>
<p>In addition to custody, Anchorage now offers several financial products, such as staking, crypto lending, etc. In other words, it wants to become a one-stop shop for institutional investors.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Anchorage also wants to become a crypto-banking-as-a-service startup. The startup thinks it could become the preferred crypto partner for both challenger banks and traditional banks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an all-around more ambitious year for Twitter. Following activist shareholder action last year that aimed to oust CEO Jack Dorsey, the company has been making long overdue product moves, buying up companies and aiming to push the envelope on how it can tap its network and drive new revenue streams. Things seem to be paying off for the company, as their share price sits at an all-time high — double that of its 2020 high.</p>
<p>Today, the company shared early details on its first ever paid product, a feature called &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; which aims to combine the community trends of Discord, the newsletter insights of Substack, the audio chat rooms of Clubhouse and the creator support of Patreon into a creator subscription. The company announced the service during its Analyst Day event Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Plenty of details are still up in the air for the feature, which notably does not have a launch timeline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2118009" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118009" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2118009 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg 2734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1012 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1350 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-10.53.24-AM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118009" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Screenshots shared by Twitter showcase a feature that allows Twitter users to subscribe to their favorite creators for a monthly price (one screenshot details a $4.99 per month cost) and earn certain subscriber-only perks, including things like &#8220;exclusive content,&#8221; &#8220;subscriber-only newsletters,&#8221; &#8220;community access,&#8221; &#8220;deals &amp; discounts,&#8221; and a &#8220;supporter badge&#8221; for subscribers. Creators in the program will also be able to paywall certain media they share, including tweets, fleets and chats they organize in Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse competitor Spaces.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s other big announcement of the event was &#8220;Communities,&#8221; a product that seems designed to compete with Facebook Groups but also will likely provide &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; networks a place to interact with creators in close cahoots. They also shared early details on a &#8220;safety mode&#8221; that will allow users to auto-block and mute abusive accounts.</p>

<p>Introducing paywalls into the Twitter feed could dramatically shift the mechanics of the service. Twitter has been pretty conservative over the years in building features that are intended for singular classes of users. Creator-focused features built for a network that is already home to so many creators could be a major threat to services like Patreon, which have largely popped up due to the lackluster monetization tools available from the big social platforms.</p>
<p>New revenue streams will undoubtedly be key to Twitter&#8217;s ambitious plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">double its revenues by 2023</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many launch providers think reusability is the best way to lower the cost and delay involved in getting to space. SpaceX and Rocket Lab have shown reusable first stages, which take a payload to the edge of space — and now <a href="https://www.stoke-space.com/">Stoke Space Technologies</a> says it is making a reusable <em>second</em> stage, which will take that payload to orbit and beyond, and has raised a $9.1 million seed round to realize it.</p>
<p>Designing a first stage that can return to Earth safely is no small task, but the fact that it only reaches a certain height and speed, and doesn&#8217;t actually climb into orbit at an even higher velocity, means that it is simpler to try. The second stage takes over when the first is spent, accelerating and guiding the payload to its destination orbit, which generally means it will have traveled a lot farther and will be going a lot faster when it tries to come back down.</p>
<p>Stoke thinks that it&#8217;s not just possible to create a second stage that&#8217;s reusable, but crucial to building the low-cost space economy that will enable decades of growth in the industry. The team previously worked on the New Glenn and New Shepard vehicles and engines at Blue Origin, the Merlin 1C for the Falcon 9 at SpaceX and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our design philosophy is to design hardware that not only can be reused, but is operationally reusable. That means fast turnaround times with low refurbishment effort. Reusability of that type has to be designed in from the beginning,&#8221; said Andy Lapsa, co-founder and CEO of Stoke.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117977" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117977" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg" alt="A rocket does a test fire in an industrial environment." width="1024" height="718" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg 2177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=1536,1077 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=2048,1436 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/stoke-hotfire.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117977" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stoke Space Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond the fact that the vehicle will employ a ballistic reentry and powered landing, Stoke did not comment on the engineering or method by which it would accomplish the Herculean feat of bringing down a few tons of precision equipment safely from 400 kilometers up and traveling some 28,000 km/h. (Though Lapsa did mention to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/stoke-space-raises-9-1-million-create-new-breed-reusable-upper-stage-rockets/">GeekWire</a> that a &#8220;good, high-performing stable injector&#8221; is the core of their engine and therefore of the system around it.)</p>
<p>At speeds like that reentry can be deadly, so one hopes they save a little fuel not just for landing but for deceleration. That would increase the mass and complexity of the vehicle before payload, lowering its carrying capacity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s true that any reusable system will be inherently more complex than its expendable counterpart,&#8221; Lapsa said. &#8220;However, when one optimizes on mission cost and availability, that complexity is well worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As other launch companies have pointed out, you burn up a lot of money on reentry, but so far the safest move has been to keep the first stage alive. The second stage is by no means cheap, and any company would prefer to recycle it as well — and indeed it could lower the cost of launch enormously if they did so successfully.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Complete Success&#8217;: Rocket Lab&#8217;s booster recovery is a big step toward reusability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/embed/#?secret=gxt41frYMe" data-secret="gxt41frYMe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The promise Stoke makes is not just to bring the upper stage home, but to bring it home and have it ready for reuse just a day later. &#8220;All launch hardware is reused time after time with aircraft-like regularity — zero refurbishment with 24-hour turnaround,&#8221; claims Lapsa.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of wear and tear a rocket goes through in ascent and landing, &#8220;zero refurbishment&#8221; may sound to many like an impossible dream. SpaceX&#8217;s reusable first stages can be turned around pretty quickly, but they can&#8217;t just fuel them up where they landed and press the button again.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Stoke aims to provide reusable-rocket service beyond low-Earth orbit, where the majority of small, lower-cost satellites go. Geosynchronous orbit and translunar or interplanetary trajectories are also planned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Missions to GTO, GEO direct, TLI and earth escape will initially be done with partially reusable or expendable vehicles, depending on mission requirements, however those vehicles will be the same ones that may have been used on previous fully reusable missions to LEO. The design is extensible to full reuse for these missions (and/or extraplanetary landers) in future variants,&#8221; said Lapsa.</p>
<p>These are ambitious claims — even, given the state of rocketry right now, ones people may with good reason call unrealistic. But the industry has advanced more quickly than many would have predicted a decade ago and seemingly unrealistic ambition drove those changes as well.</p>
<p>The $9.1 million seed round raised by Stoke will enable it to meet the next few milestones, but anyone who follows the industry will know that far more cash will be needed to cover the cost of development and testing in time.</p>
<p>The round was led by NFX and MaC Ventures, along with YC, Seven Seven Six (Alexis Ohanian), Liquid2 (Joe Montana), Trevor Blackwell, Kyle Vogt and Charlie Songhurst, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotics took a small step into the wild world of SPACs this week, as<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/"> Berkshire Grey announced</a></strong> its plan to go public by Q2. Setting aside some of the bigger issues with using the reverse merger route we’ve discussed plenty, BG is an ideal candidate for this next major step for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, the company’s got a track record and a ton of interest. I visited their HQ early last year, before the country shut down. Their plans were already fairly aggressive, with the wind of a recently raised $263 million Series B at their back. Retailers everywhere are already looking to automation as a way of staying competitive with the ominous monolith that is Amazon.</p>
<p>The mega-retailer has already acquired and deployed a ton of robots in fulfillment centers across the world. The latest number I’ve seen is 200,000. That comes from early 2020, so the number has no doubt increased since then. As Locus Robotics CEO Rick Faulk told me the other week, “There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.” As with so many things these days, it’s Amazon versus the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2117463" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117463" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2117463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg 1363w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RSR_picking_at_BD_3_2-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkshire Grey</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond its knack for raising money by the boatload, Berkshire Grey is the company you go to when you’re looking to automate a factory from the ground, up. The company says current warehouse automation is somewhere in the neighborhood of 5%. It’s a figure I’ve seen tossed around before, and certainly points to a ton of opportunity. BG’s offering isn’t lights-out automation, but it’s a pretty full-feature solution.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">Locus, which just raised a healthy $150M Series E</a></strong>, represents a different end of the spectrum. Similar to offerings from companies like Fetch, it offers a more plug-and-play approach to automation. The lowered barrier of entry means a far less costly on-ramp. It also means you don’t have to shut down your warehouses for an extended period to implement the tech. It’s a more workable solution for situations with contract-based clients or temporary seasonal needs.</p>

<p>The company uses a RaaS (robot-as-a-service) model to deploy its technology. That’s something you’re going to be hearing more and more of around the industry. Like the HaaS (the “h” being hardware) model, the company essentially rents out these super-pricey machines, rather than selling them outright. It’s another way to lower the barrier of entry, and it gives the robotics companies the opportunity to offer continuous service upgrades.</p>

<p>It’s a model <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/future-acres-launches-with-the-arrival-of-crop-transporting-robot-carry/">Future Acres, a Southern Californian agtech</a></strong> startup, is exploring as it comes out of stealth. Things are still early days for the company, which spun out of Wavemaker Partners (which also developed food service robotics company Miso). Among other things, the company is looking toward a crowdfunded raise by way of SeedInvest. I’ve not seen a lot of robotics companies take that route, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.</p>

<p>Like logistics, agtech is shaping up to be a pretty massive category for robotics investments. FarmWise was ahead of that curve, announcing a $14.5 million round back in 2019 (bringing its total to north of $20 million). This week the Bay Area startup <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/farmwise-plans-to-add-autonomous-crop-dusting-to-its-suite-of-robotic-services/">added crop dusting functionality to its weed-pulling robot</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">NASA’s Perseverance</a> </strong>understandably grabbed the biggest robotics headlines of the week. Landing with a parachute sporting the JPL motto, &#8220;Dare mighty things,&#8221; the rover sent back some of the best and most stunning images of Mars to date.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/mschf-mounted-a-remote-control-paintball-gun-to-spot/">MSCHF’s livestream</a></strong>, on the other hand, was a bit more spotty. But aside from a fair number of interruptions with the feed, I suspect the company’s 40th drop went about as well as it could have hoped. Prior to announcing that it would mount a remote-control paintball gun to the back of Spot, Boston Dynamics issued a statement condemning the move:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mission is to create and deliver surprisingly capable robots that inspire, delight &amp; positively impact society. We take great care to make sure our customers intend to use our robots for legal uses. We cross-check every purchase request against the U.S. Government’s denied persons and entities lists, prior to authorizing a sale.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2115586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115586" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/spot-ramp-gif-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: MSCHF</strong></p></div></p>
<p>MSCHF seemed to bask in the attention, even before its name was revealed to the public. At the very least, the stunt was a success from the standpoint of having ignited a conversation about the future of robotics. Boston Dynamics intrinsically understands that its robots sometimes freak people out &#8212; it’s a big part of the reason we get viral videos from the company, like the recent one featuring various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw">robots dancing to The Contours</a>.</p>
<p>Among other things, the company is pushing back against the dystopian optics of shows like Black Mirror. Of course, a paintball gun isn’t a weapon, per say. But for the moment, optics are also important. A rep from the company told me, &#8220;I turned down a customer that wanted to use Spot for a haunted house. Even putting it in that context of using our technology to scare people was not within our terms of use and not how we imagined the product being beneficial for people, and so we declined that initial sale.”</p>

This week, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/23/video-shows-nypds-new-robotic-dog-in-action-in-the-bronx/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">NYPD deployed a Spot robot yet again</a> &#8212; this time at the scene of a home invasion in the Bronx (not to mention a new paint job and the name &#8220;Digidog&#8221; for some reason). Your own interpretation of those particular optics will likely depend on, among other things, your feelings about cops.</p>
<p>Certainly police departments have utilized robotics for decades for bomb disposal. It’s true that Boston Dynamics (along with much of the robotics industry) got early funding from DARPA. Spot in its current form isn’t much as far as war machines go, but I think these are important conversations to have at this stage in robotic evolution. Certainly there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_U.S._drone_strikes">are military drones in the world</a>, and have been for more than a decade.</p>
<p>That’s an important ethical conversation. As is the responsibility of robotics manufacturers once their machines are out in the world. Boston Dynamics does due diligence when selling its robots, but does it continue to be responsible for them once it no longer owns them? That&#8217;s certainly not a question we&#8217;re going to answer this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sergey Brin’s secretive airship company LTA Research and Exploration is planning to power a huge disaster relief airship with an equally record-breaking hydrogen fuel cell.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/careers/hydrogen-program-manager/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">job listing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the company, which is based in Mountain View, California and Akron, Ohio, reveals that LTA wants to configure a 1.5-megawatt hydrogen propulsion system for an airship to deliver humanitarian aid and revolutionize transportation. While there are no specs tied to the job listing, such a system would likely be powerful enough to cross oceans. Although airships travel much slower than jet planes, they can potentially land or deliver goods almost anywhere.</span></p>
<p>Hydrogen fuel cells are an attractive solution for electric aviation because they are lighter and potentially cheaper than lithium-ion batteries. However, the largest hydrogen fuel cell to fly to date is a 0.25-megawatt system (250 kilowatts) in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/zeroavias-hydrogen-powered-vision-for-aviation-nets-21-4-million-from-amazon-shell-and-bill-gates-backed-fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ZeroAvia’s small passenger plane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last September. LTA’s first crewed prototype airship, called Pathfinder 1, will be powered by batteries when it takes to the air, possibly this year. FAA records show that the Pathfinder 1 has 12 electric motors and would be able to carry 14 people. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That makes it about the same size as the only passenger airship operating today, the Zeppelin NT, which conducts<a href="https://zeppelin-nt.de/en/homepage.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sightseeing tours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Germany and Switzerland. The Pathfinder 1 also uses some Zeppelin components in its passenger gondola. </span></p>

<p>Since the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, most airships, including LTA’s, have used non-flammable helium as a lifting gas. But using hydrogen for fuel still makes sense, according to Professor Dr. Josef Kallo of the German Aerospace Center, which is<a href="https://www.dlr.de/content/en/articles/news/2021/01/20210121_balis-project-funding.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">developing its own 1.5 MW fuel cell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to power a 60-seater regional electric aircraft. </span></p>
<p>“Where we could go something like 125 miles with batteries, we should be able to go nearly 1,000 miles using hydrogen,” Kallo said. “And airships are even more perfect for the efficiency of fuel cells.”</p>
<p>Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and electricity, but are traditionally heavy and complex. Putting one in an aircraft adds extra complications such as safely transporting the liquid hydrogen in fuel tanks, storing the water produced and dealing with a lot of waste heat.</p>
<p>LTA’s first fuel cell will be a 0.75 MW system, built by a third party and retrofitted into one of its existing prototypes, according to the job listing. That is unlikely to happen this year, however. A planned Pathfinder 3 airship, which will run on batteries, still has not been registered with the FAA.</p>

<p>“Functionality wise, there is no showstopper to using a hydrogen fuel cell,” Kallo said. “The challenge is to find someone who can afford not to look at the business case, because I don&#8217;t think it works out from an economic perspective. Maybe Sergey Brin can afford to do that.”</p>
<p>Brin is currently the<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/sergey-brin/?sh=723d50b4b432"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ninth richest person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world, with a net worth of over $86 billion.</span><a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/careers/hydrogen-program-manager/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LTA’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says the initial use case for its aircraft will be “humanitarian disaster response and relief efforts, especially in remote areas that cannot be easily accessed by plane and boat due to limited or destroyed infrastructure.” Ultimately, it intends to create a family of zero emissions aircraft for global cargo and passenger travel.</span></p>
<p>LTA has already started its charitable work, producing more than 5 million face masks for first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic, and donating nearly $3 million last year to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>LTA is likely to operate closely with Brin’s nonprofit disaster relief force,<a href="https://gsd.ngo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Support and Development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GSD), which is based just a few miles from LTA’s Mountain View hangars. GSD has deployed medics and ex-military personnel to</span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/google-co-founder-sergey-brin-has-a-secret-disaster-relief-squad"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous natural disasters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past five years. It prides itself on its ability to arrive before traditional NGOs, on occasion even using Brin’s own superyacht. Tax records show that Brin is by far the largest funder of GSD, giving it at least $7.5 million in 2019. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity, equity and inclusion. These essential elements remain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/">woefully lacking</a> across the tech industry despite recent strides. Join us on March 3 — just one week away — for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>. Hear from and engage with the top experts and leading voices working to change the tech industry for the good of all humanity.</p>
<p>That may sound like a lofty goal, but we’re talking serious disrupters — founders, investors, engineers and visionaries with the drive and the tech chops to back up their ambitions. Folks like Naj Austin, Brian Brackeen, Arlan Hamilton, Wade Davis and plenty more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">incredible speakers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Your ticket</a> gives you access to an enormous amount of knowledge, inspiration, advice, connection and opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s just a taste of the interactive presentations, breakout sessions and panel discussions waiting for you. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">Check the agenda</a> for the full lineup and get your game plan on. Who knows? We may add a surprise or two.</p>
<p><strong>Tech in the Era of Accountability:</strong> A hands-off approach to moderating online platforms invited hate to flourish in plain sight over the last four years. We’ll speak with Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on proposed policy solutions, whether tech is on the cusp of a real era of accountability and what the organization’s mission looks like in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>State of the Union: </strong>Labor unions have been uncommon in tech. That’s finally starting to change in recent years, as workers have pushed to organize at some of the industry’s biggest companies, from Alphabet to Kickstarter. Parul Koul (Google), Grace Reckers (Office and Professional Employees International Union) and Clarissa Redwine (NYU) will join us to discuss the growing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn:</strong> Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton discusses how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p>Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to meet some of the early-stage founders in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/include/">TC Include Program</a> — and watch them take part in live pitch feedback sessions. These young startup entrepreneurs were nominated by our partner founder organizations, <a href="https://www.blackfemalefounders.org/">Black Female Founders</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LatinxStartupAlliance/">Latinx Startup Alliance</a>, <a href="https://startout.org/">Startout</a> and the <a href="https://femalefounders.org/">Female Founders Alliance.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> takes place in one week on March 3. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Reserve your seat today</a>, and add your voice to the chorus of leaders creating opportunities and meaningful — long overdue — change in tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Accounting isn&#8217;t a topic that most people can get excited about &#8212; probably not even most accountants. But if you&#8217;re running any kind of business, there&#8217;s just no way around it. Santa Clara-based <a href="https://docyt.com/">Docyt</a> wants to make the life of small and medium business owners (and their accounting firms) a bit easier by using machine learning to handle a lot of the routine tasks around collecting financial data, digitizing receipts, categorization and &#8212; maybe most importantly &#8212; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reconciliation.asp">reconciliation</a>.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $1.5 million seed-extension round led by First Rays Venture Partners with participation from Morado Ventures and a group of angel investors. Docyt (pronounced &#8220;docket&#8221;) had previously raised a $2.2 million seed round from Morado Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Westwave Capital, Xplorer Capital, Tuesday and angel investors. The company plans to use the new investment to accelerate its customer growth.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem like Docyt competes with the likes of QuickBooks, which is pretty much the de facto standard for small business accounting. But Docyt co-founder and CTO Sugam Pandey tells me that he thinks of the service as a partner to the likes of QuickBooks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117900" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png 1968w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Docyt</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Docyt is a product for the small business owners who find accounting very complex, who are very experienced on how to run and grow their business, but not really an expert in accounting. At the same time, businesses who are graduating out of QuickBooks &#8212; small business owners sometimes become midsized enterprises as well &#8212; [ … ] they start growing out of their accounting systems like QuickBooks and looking for more sophisticated systems like NetSuite and Sage. And Docyt fits in in that space as well, extending the life of QuickBooks for such business owners so they don&#8217;t have to change their systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its earliest days, Docyt was a secure document sharing platform with a focus on mobile. Some of this is still in the company&#8217;s DNA, with its focus on being able to pull in financial documents and then reconciling that with a business&#8217; bank transactions. While other systems may put the emphasis on transaction data, Docyt&#8217;s emphasis is on documents. That means you can forward an emailed receipt to the service, for example, and it can automatically attach this to a financial transaction from your credit card or bank statement (the service uses Plaid to pull in this data).</p>

<p>For new transactions, you sometimes have to train the system by entering some of this information by hand, but over time, Docyt should be able to do most of this automatically and then sync your data with QuickBooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Docyt is the first company to apply AI across the entire accounting stack,&#8221; said Amit Sridharan, founding general partner at First Rays Venture Partners. &#8220;Docyt software&#8217;s AI-powered data extraction, auto categorization and auto reconciliation is unparalleled. It&#8217;s an enterprise-level, powerful solution that&#8217;s affordable and accessible to small and medium businesses.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos&#8217; space company Blue Origin published an <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight">updated timeline</a> for the first flight of New Glenn, the orbital rocket it&#8217;s building to complement its existing New Shepard suborbital space launch vehicle. The company is now targeting Q4 2022 — a slippage of roughly a year from the prior stated timeline of sometime toward the end of 2021. The main cause, per Blue Origin? Space Force passing on using New Glenn to launch national security payloads during a recent contract bid process.</p>

<p>Blue Origin said in a blog post that the &#8220;schedule has been refined to match the demand of Blue Origin&#8217;s commercial customers,&#8221; and specifically says it &#8220;follows the recent Space Force decision to not select New Glenn for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Launch Services Procurement (LSP).&#8221; Those awards were announced last August, and the two winners were the United Launch Alliance (ULA) and SpaceX, who prevailed over Blue Origin, and also Northrop Grumman. The launch service contracts that make up the awards begin in 2022, so it makes sense why Blue Origin had been pushing for a first launch of New Glenn by the end of this year in order to meet the needs of Space Force.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While it may not be under the same time pressure without access to those contracts, it&#8217;s still making &#8220;major progress&#8221; toward New Glenn and the facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida from which it&#8217;ll launch, according to the company. Blue Origin shared tweets showing off some of its progress, including work on the New Glenn rocket factory, testing facility and Launch Complex 36. It also said it&#8217;s put more than $2.5 billion into the facilities and infrastructure that will support its eventual launches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lee.house.gov/">Rep. Barbara Lee</a>, who has represented the East Bay of California since 1998, is one of Congress’s staunchest proponents of diversity in tech. Representing Oakland, Emeryville and other cities nestled around the hills of the East Bay, she knows all too well about the benefits reaped by those in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and beyond.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Rep. Lee will be joining us for a fireside chat at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> in just a few days.</p>
<p>By focusing on racial injustice, among the many other issues facing her constituency, Lee has highlighted the ways in which access to tech remains out of reach for people from underserved communities. And this doesn’t just refer to the so-called &#8220;pipeline problem,&#8221; which is, arguably, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">myth</a>. It is also about the lack of tech education in early grades through high school, as well as a lack of access to computers and reliable broadband, which most of us take for granted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We will speak with Lee about the opportunities that the tech industry has to create for an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers, coders and the like can take part in everything it has to offer. We will also discuss her membership in the Congressional Black Caucus, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, as well as her role as co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/these-5-vcs-have-high-hopes-for-cannabis-in-2021/">burgeoning</a> cannabis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/2020-was-a-defining-year-for-cannabis-what-comes-next/">industry</a> will be a good place to start.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">Head here to secure your seat</a> to TechCrunch Sessions: Justice. In addition to Rep. Lee, you&#8217;ll hear from Backstage Capital&#8217;s Arlan Hamilton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/hear-from-arlan-hamilton-on-finding-the-next-big-opportunities-in-tech-at-tc-sessions-justice/">on finding the next big opportunities in tech</a>, learn how to creatively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/learn-how-to-creatively-navigate-remote-fundraising-from-top-investors/">navigate remote fundraising from top investors</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/learn-about-the-importance-of-accessible-product-design-at-techcrunch-sessions-justice/">examine the importance of accessible product design</a> and learn how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/battling-algorithmic-bias-at-tc-sessions-justice/">battle algorithmic bias</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">Register now</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Health and life science specialist investment firm <a href="https://www.foresitecapital.com">Foresite Capital</a> has raised a new fund, its fifth to date, totaling $969 million in commitments from LPs. This is the firm&#8217;s largest fund to date and was oversubscribed relative to its original target according to fund CEO and founder Dr. Jim Tananbaum, who told me that while the fundraising process started out slow in the early months of the pandemic, it gained steam quickly starting around last fall and ultimately exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>This latest fund actually makes up two separate investment vehicles, Foresite Capital Fund V, and Foresite Capital Opportunity Fund V, but Tananbaum says that the money will be used to fuel investments in line with its existing approach, which includes companies ranging from early to late stage, and everything in between. Foresite&#8217;s approach is designed to help it be uniquely positioned to shepherd companies from founding (they also have a company-building incubator) all the way to public market exit — and even beyond. Tananbaum said that they&#8217;re also very interested in coming in later to startups they missed out on at earlier stages of their growth, however.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117784" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117784" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg 2078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=2048,1342 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117784" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foresite Capital</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We can also come into a later situation that&#8217;s competitive with a number of hedge funds, and bring something unique to the table, because we have all these value-added resources that we used to start companies,&#8221; Tananbaum said. &#8220;So we have a competitive advantage for later-stage deals, and we have a competitive advantage for early-stage deals, by virtue of being able to function at a high level in the capital markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foresite&#8217;s other advantage, according to Tananbaum, is that it has long focused on the intersection of traditional tech business mechanics and biotech. That approach has especially paid off in recent years, he says, since the gap between the two continues to narrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just had this enormous belief that technology, and tools and data science, machine learning, biotechnology, biology, and genetics — they are going to come together,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been an organization out there that really speaks both languages well for entrepreneurs and knows how to bring that diverse set of people together. So that&#8217;s what we specialized in and we have a lot of resources and a lot of cross-lingual resources, so that techies that can talk to biotechies, and biotechies can talk to techies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foresite extended this approach to company formation with the creation of Foresite Labs, an incubation platform that it spun up in October 2019 to leverage this experience at the earliest possible stage of startup founding. It&#8217;s run by Dr. Vik Bajaj, who was previously co-founder and chief science officer of Alphabet&#8217;s Verily health sciences enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on, [over the] last couple decades, is that the innovation cycles are getting faster and faster,&#8221; Tananbaum said. &#8220;So at some point the people that are having the really big wins on the public side are saying, &#8216;Well, these really big wins are being driven by innovation and by quality science, so let&#8217;s go a little bit more upstream on the quality science.'&#8221;</p>
<p>That has combined with shorter and shorter healthcare product development cycles, he added, aided by general improvements in technology. Tananbaum pointed out that when he began Foresite in 2011, the time horizons for returns on healthcare investments were significantly longer and at the outside edge of the tolerances of venture economics. Now, however, they&#8217;re much closer to those found in the general tech startup ecosystem, even in the case of fundamental scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Basically, you&#8217;re seeing people now really look at biotech in general in the same kind of way that you would look at a tech company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are these tech metrics that now also apply in biotech, about adoption velocity [and] other things that may not exactly equate to immediate revenue but give you all the core material that usually works over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Foresite&#8217;s investment thesis focuses on funding companies in three areas — therapeutics at the clinical stage, infrastructure focused on automation and data generation, and what Tananbaum calls &#8220;individualized care.&#8221; All three are part of a continuum in the tech-enabled healthcare end state that he envisions, ultimately resulting in &#8220;a world where we&#8217;re able to, at the individual level, help someone understand what their predispositions are to disease development.&#8221; That, Tananbaum suggests, will result in a transformation of this kind of targeted care into an everyday consumer experience — in the same way tech in general has taken previously specialist functions and abilities, and made them generally available to the public at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The executive who built the financial services boutique for Paytm, India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, is ready to do something similar all over again.</p>
<p>Pravin Jadhav, the former chief executive of Paytm Money, revealed on Thursday his own startup, <a href="https://www.raiseholding.co">Raise Financial Services</a>.</p>
<p>This time, Jadhav &#8212; under whose leadership Paytm had amassed more than 6 million Money customers &#8212; is focusing on serving a different set of the population.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hundreds of millions of users in India today don’t have access to financial services. They don’t have a credit card, banks don’t lend to them and they have never purchased an insurance cover or invested in mutual funds or stocks.</p>
<p>Scores of large firms and startups in India today are attempting to reach these users by building an underwriting technology that can use alternative data to determine an applicant’s credit worthiness. It’s a tough and capital-intensive business, built on pillars of uncertainties, assumptions and hopes.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Jadhav said Raise Financial Services is aimed at customers living in metro, tier 1 and tier 2 cities (so very much in and around urban cities). “They want financial products, they are literate about these products, but they are not being served the way they should be,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117918" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117918" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2117918 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117918" class="wp-caption-text">Pravin Jadhav, left, poses with Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Jadhav left Paytm last year. Image Credits: Paytm</p></div></p>
<p>He said his new startup will offer products across financial services including investing, financing, insurance, wealth and payments. “Just not doing the banking part, as I believe that is more of an infrastructure play,” he said.</p>
<p>“The idea is to offer great exceptional products that are not being offered by anyone. Number 2: Focus a lot on tech-driven distribution. And third is that today the quality of customer service experience is bad across the market. So we are trying to solve that,” he said. “Over time, we will try to stitch all of this together.”</p>
<p>Jadhav also announced he has raised a seed financing round. He did not disclose the amount, but revealed enough high-profile names, including: Kunal Shah (Cred), Kalyan Krishnamurthy (Flipkart), Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar (Udaan), Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari (PhonePe), Amrish Rau (Pine Labs, Citrus Pay), Sandeep Tandon (Freecharge), Jitendra Gupta (Jupiter), Girish Mathrubootham (Freshworks), Nischal Shetty (WazirX), Kuldeep Dhankar (Clevertap), Sreevatsa Prabhakar (Servify) and Amit Bhor (Walnut).</p>
<p>Jadhav himself is also investing, and venture investor Mirae Asset Venture is leading the round, with participation from Multi-Act Private Equity, Blume Ventures (via its Founder’s Fund) and U.S.-based early-stage investor Social Leverage, for which it is the first investment in India.</p>
<p>Ashish Dave, CEO of Mirae Asset Venture&#8217;s India business, told TechCrunch that even though he had known Jadhav, it was listening to him at various Clubhouse sessions that prompted him to reach out.</p>
<p>Jadhav said users can expect the startup’s first product to be live by the end of the year. (TechCrunch understands it’s shipping much sooner. Raise Financial Services&#8217; offerings will have some similarities with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/another-major-fintech-exit-as-sofi-acquires-banking-and-payments-platform-galileo-for-1-2b/">SoFi</a> and Goldman Sachs&#8217; Marcus.)</p>
