										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three of the leading exam proctoring companies are facing calls to be more transparent, amid continued claims of bias by students forced to take remote exams because of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>Exam proctoring tech lets students take remotely invigilated tests from home. Students are told to install their university’s choice of proctoring software, which allows the exam monitor deep access to the student’s computer, including their webcams and microphones, to monitor their activity to spot potential cheating.</p>
<p>But companies like Proctorio, ExamSoft, and ProctorU have faced a barrage of criticism from students who say that their proctoring technology is fraught with problems, including issues of bias — all of which could impact their test results.</p>
<p>Chief among the complaints are that their proctoring software cannot recognize faces with darker skin tones or religious headgear, and discriminates against students with disabilities and those in lower-income areas who may not have the internet speeds to meet the standards of the test-taking tech.</p>
<p>Several U.S. Democratic senators sent Proctorio, ExamSoft, and ProctorU letters in December calling on the companies to explain their technology and policies better. In their responses seen by TechCrunch, the companies rejected claims of discrimination and all said that it&#8217;s up to the teachers to decide whether a student has cheated, not the companies themselves.</p>
<p>But lawmakers say that the companies are not transparent enough, and worry teachers could be making decisions about a student&#8217;s conduct based on little more than what the technology tells them.</p>
<p>“Proctorio, ExamSoft, and ProctorU claim they don’t have problems with bias, yet alarming reports from students tell a different story,&#8221; Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told TechCrunch. &#8220;These responses from the companies are only the first step in learning more about how they operate, but much more transparency is needed into the systems that have the power to accuse students of cheating. I will work on every fix necessary to ensure students are protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students across the U.S. have already <a href="https://www.change.org/p/washington-state-university-students-boycott-proctoru">called on their schools</a> to <a href="https://www.change.org/p/mark-b-rosenberg-request-to-ban-fiu-from-forcing-students-to-use-honorlock">stop using proctoring software</a> citing privacy and security risks.</p>
<p>We sent the companies several questions. ProctorU&#8217;s chief executive Scott McFarland declined to comment citing the holiday weekend. Proctorio and ExamSoft did not respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When a system outage happens, chaos can ensue as the team tries to figure out what&#8217;s happening and how to fix it. <a href="http://stackpulse.com">StackPulse</a>, a new startup that wants to help developers manage these crisis situations more efficiently, emerged from stealth today with a $28 million investment.</p>
<p>The round actually breaks down to a previously unannounced $8 million seed investment and a new $20 million Series A. GGV led the A round, while Bessemer Venture Partners led the seed and also participated in the A. Glenn Solomon at GGV and Amit Karp at Bessemer will join the StackPulse board.</p>
<p>Nobody is immune to these outages. We&#8217;ve seen incidents from companies as varied as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-a-portion-of-the-internet-down-with-it/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/its-not-just-you-slack-is-struggling-this-morning/">Slack</a> in recent months. The biggest companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon employ site reliability engineers and build customized platforms to help remediate these kinds of situations. StackPulse hopes to put this kind of capability within reach of companies, whose only defense is the on-call developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ofer Smadari says that in the midst of a crisis with signals coming at you from Slack and PagerDuty and other sources, it&#8217;s hard to figure out what&#8217;s happening. StackPulse is designed to help sort out the details to get you back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TvDEgpQ3Ve"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/">FireHydrant  lands $8M Series A for disaster management tool</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FireHydrant  lands $8M Series A for disaster management tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/firehyrdant-lands-8m-series-a-for-disaster-management-tool/embed/#?secret=TvDEgpQ3Ve" data-secret="TvDEgpQ3Ve" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First off, it helps identify the severity of the incident. Is it a false alarm or something that requires your team&#8217;s immediate attention or something that can be put off for a later maintenance cycle. If there is something going wrong that needs to be fixed right now, StackPulse can not only identify the source of the problem, but also help fix it automatically, Smadari explained.</p>
<p>After the incident has been resolved, it can also help with a post mortem to figure out what exactly went wrong by pulling in all of the alert communications and incident data into the platform.</p>
<p>As the company emerges from stealth, it has some early customers and 35 employees based in Portland, Oregon and Tel Aviv. Smadari says that he hopes to have 100 employees by the end of this year. As he builds the organization, he is thinking about how to build a diverse team for a diverse customer base. He believes that people with diverse backgrounds build a better product. He adds that diversity is a top level goal for the company, which already has an HR leader in place to help.</p>
<p>Glenn Solomon from GGV, who will be joining the company board, saw a strong founding team solving a big problem for companies and wanted to invest. &#8220;When they described the vision for the product they wanted to build, it made sense to us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Customers are impatient with down time and Solomon sees developers on the front line trying to solve these issues. &#8220;Performance is more important than ever. When there is downtime, it&#8217;s damaging to companies,&#8221; he said. He believes StackPulse can help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">University education is getting more <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/trends/college-pricing/highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a>, and at the moment it feels a bit like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/us/covid-colleges-nursing-homes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">petrie dish for infections</a>, but the long-term trends continue to show a <a href="https://monitor.icef.com/2018/10/study-projects-dramatic-growth-global-higher-education-2040/">dramatic growth</a> in the number of people worldwide getting degrees beyond high school, with one big reason for this being that a college degree generally provides better economic security.</p>
<p>But today, a startup that is exploring a different route for those interested in technology and knowledge worker positions &#8212; specifically by way of apprenticeships to bring in and train younger people on the job &#8212; is announcing a significant round of growth funding to see if it can provide a credible, scalable alternative to that model.</p>
<p><a href="http://multiverse.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiverse</a>, a UK startup that works with organizations to develop these apprenticeships, and then helps source promising, diverse candidates to fill those roles, has raised $44 million, funding that it will be using to spearhead a move into the US market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by General Catalyst (which has been especially active this week with UK startups: it also led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/uks-bloom-wild-raises-102m-to-seed-its-flower-delivery-service-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large round yesterday for Bloom &amp; Wild</a>), with GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Audacious Ventures, Latitude and SemperVirens also participating. Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, who first invested in the company in its $16 million Series A in 2020, also participated.</p>
<p>Valuation is not being disclosed but for what it&#8217;s worth, the round was one that generated a lot of interest. In between getting pitched this story and publishing it, the size of the Series B grew by $8 million (it was originally closed at $36 million).</p>
<p>The company was originally co-founded as WhiteHat and is officially rebranding today. Co-founder Euan Blair (who happens to be the son of the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and his accomplished barrister wife Cherie Booth Blair) said the name change was because the original name was a reference to how the startup sought to &#8220;hack the system for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, he added, &#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he scale has become bigger and more evolved.&#8221; The new name is to convey that &#8212; as in gaming, which is probably the arena where you might have heard this term before &#8212; &#8220;anything is possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There are &#8220;multiple universes&#8221; one can inhabit as a post-18 young adult, Blair continued, and while it&#8217;s been assumed that to get into tech, the obvious route was college or university, the bet that Multiverse is making here is that apprenticeships can easily, and widely, become another. &#8220;We want to b</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uild an outstanding alternative to university and college,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is especially important when thinking of how to target more marginalized groups and how this ties up with how tech companies are looking to be more diverse in the future. Blair said that currently over half of the people making their way through Multiverse are people of color, and 57% are women, and the plan is to build tools to make that an even firmer part of its mission. </span></p>
<p>The startup sees itself as part-tech company and part-education enterprise. It works with tech companies and others to open up opportunities for people who have not had any higher education or any training, where fresh high school graduates can come in, learn the ropes of a job while getting paid, and then continue on working their way up the ladder with that knowledge base in place. <a href="https://platform.multiverse.io/apprenticeships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeships on the platform right now</a> range from data analysts through to exhibition designers, and the idea is that by opening up and targeting the US market, the breadth, number and location of roles will grow.</p>
<p>This is not just a social enterprise: there is actual money in this area. Blair prices that it charges the companies it works with range by qualification &#8220;but are broadly around the $15,000 mark.&#8221; (The individuals applying don&#8217;t pay anything, and they will eventually also be paid by the companies providing the apprenticeships.)</p>
<p>On the educational front, Multiverse doesn&#8217;t just connect people as a recruiter might: it has a team in place to build out what the &#8220;curriculum&#8221; might be for a particular apprenticeship, and how to deliver and train people with the requisite skills alongside the practice experience of working, and more.</p>
<p>That latter role, of course, has taken on a more poignant dimension in the last year: concepts like remote training and virtual mentorship have very much come into their own at a time when offices are largely standing empty to help reduce the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the year ahead &#8212; fingers crossed that vaccinations and other efforts will help us collectively move past where we are right now &#8212; many believe that the infrastructure that has been put into place to keep working virtually will continue to be used, which bodes well for a company like Multiverse that is building a business around that, both with technology it creates itself and will bring in from third parties and partners.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ecosystem of companies building tools to deliver educational content, provide training and work collaboratively has really boomed in the pandemic, giving companies like Multiverse a large library of options for how to bring people into new work situations. (Google, which is now an investor in Multiverse, is very much one of the makers of such education tools.)</p>
<p>Apprenticeships are an interesting area for a startup to tackle. Traditionally, it&#8217;s a term that would have been associated mainly with skilled labor positions, rather than &#8220;knowledge workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you can argue that with the bigger swing that the globe has seen away from industrial and towards knowledge economies, there is an argument to be made for building more enterprises and opportunities for an ever wider pool of users, rather than expecting everyone to be shoehorned into the models of the last 50 years. (The latter would essentially imply that college is possibly the only way up.)</p>
<p>You might also be fair to claim that Blair&#8217;s connections helped him secure funding and open doors with would-be customers, and that might well be the case, but ultimately the startup will live or die by how well it executes on its premise, whether it finds a good way to connect more people, engage them in opportunities, and keep them on board.</p>
<p>This is what really attracted the investors, said Joel Cutler, managing director and co-founder of General Catalyst.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Euan has a genuine belief that this is important, and when you talk to him, you get a  feeling of manifest destiny,&#8221; Cutler said in an interview. In response to the question of family connections, he said that this was precisely the kind of issue that the technology industry should be tackling to fight.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Of all the industries to break the mold of where you went to school, it should be the tech world that will do that, since it is far more of a meritocracy than others. This is the perfect place to start to break that mold,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Education will be super valuable but apprenticeships will also be important.&#8221; He noted that another company that General Catalyst invests in, <a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guild Education</a>, is addressing similar opportunities, or rather the gaps in current opportunities, for older people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise has raised $2 billion in a new equity round that has pushed its valuation up to $30 billion and delivered Microsoft as an investor and partner.</p>
<p>GM, Honda and other institutional investors have also put more capital into Cruise as the autonomous vehicle company inches closer to commercializing its technology.</p>
<p>While Microsoft&#8217;s capital is important, the partnership might provide equal and longer term value for Cruise, at least in the two companies&#8217; views. Under the long-term strategic partnership, Cruise will leverage Azure, Microsoft&#8217;s cloud and edge computing platform, to commercialize its autonomous vehicle solutions at scale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any autonomous vehicle company aiming to commercialize — meaning bring their tech to the public at scale — needs a robust cloud computing platform. Operating fleets of self-driving vehicles that will shuttle people and even packages generates a massive amount of data, making cloud services one of the bigger costs for an AV company.</p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s partnership with Microsoft aims to provide benefits for both companies. Cruise will be able to lock in lower prices for cloud services and Microsoft will be able to test some of its bleeding edge systems that can handle workloads needed to bring machine learning and robotics — like autonomous vehicles — to life and at scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advances in digital technology are redefining every aspect of our work and life, including how we move people and goods,&#8221; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. &#8220;As Cruise and GM&#8217;s preferred cloud, we will apply the power of Azure to help them scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The partnership extends to GM as well, according to Tuesday&#8217;s announcement. Microsoft will be GM&#8217;s preferred public cloud provider to help the automaker accelerate several of it digitization initiatives as well as streamline operations across digital supply chains.</p>
<p>The partnership will not only allow Cruise to accelerate the commercialization of its all-electric, self-driving vehicles, it help &#8220;GM realize even more benefits from cloud computing as we launch 30 new electric vehicles globally by 2025 and create new businesses and services to drive growth, GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://latticeflow.ai/">LatticeFlow</a>, an AI startup that was spun out of ETH Zurich in 2020, today announced that it has raised a $2.8 million seed funding round led by Swiss deep-tech fund <a href="https://btov.vc/">btov</a> and Global Founders Capital, which previously backed the likes of Revolut, Slack and Zalando.</p>
<p>The general idea behind LatticeFlow is to build tools that help AI teams build and deploy AI models that are safe, reliable and trustworthy. The problem today, the team argues, is that models get very good at finding the right statistical patterns to hit a given benchmark. That makes them inflexible, though, since these models were optimized for accuracy in a lab setting, not for robustness in the real world.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most commonly used paradigms for evaluating machine learning models is just aggregate metrics, like accuracy. And, of course, this is a super coarse representation of how good a model really is,&#8221; Pavol Bielik, the company&#8217;s CTO explained. &#8220;What we want to do is, we provide systematic ways of monitoring models, assessing their reliability across different relevant data slices and then also provide tools for improving these models.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2097263" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097263" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2097263" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png" alt="" width="1024" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png 2205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=768,263 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=680,233 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=1536,526 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=2048,701 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/example.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2097263" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LatticeFlow</p></div></p>
<p>Building these kinds of models that are more flexible yet still provide robust results will take a new arsenal of tools, though, as well as the right team with deep expertise in these areas. Clearly, though, this is a founding team with the right background. In addition to CTO Bielik, the founding team includes Petar Tsankov, the company&#8217;s CEO and former senior researcher and lecturer at ETH Zurich, as well as ETH professors Martin Vechev, who leads the Secure, Reliable and Intelligence Systems lab at ETH, and Andreas Krause, who leads ETH&#8217;s Learning &amp; Adaptive Systems lab. Tsankov&#8217;s last startup, <a href="https://www.deepcode.ai/">DeepCode</a>, was acquired by cybersecurity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/snyk-bags-another-200m-at-2-6b-valuation-9-months-after-last-raise/">Snyk</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Vechev, who previously co-founded ETH spin-off ChainSecurity, and his group at ETH previously developed <a href="https://github.com/eth-sri/eran">ERAN</a>, a verifier for large deep learning models with millions of parameters, that last year won the first competition for certifying deep neural networks. While the team was already looking at creating a company before winning this competition, Vechev noted that gave the team the confirmation that it was on the right path.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to solve the main AI problem, which is making AI usable. This is the overarching goal,&#8221; Vechev told me. &#8220;[&#8230;] I don&#8217;t think you can actually found the company just purely based on the certification work. I think the kinds of skills that people have in the company, my group, Andreas [Krause]&#8217;s group, they all complement each other and cover a huge space, which I think is very, very unique. I don&#8217;t know of other companies who have covered this range of skills in these pressing points and have done groundbreaking work before.&#8221;</p>
<p>LatticeWorks already has a set of pilot customers who are trialing its tools. These include Swiss railways (SBB), which is using it to build a tool for automatic rail inspections, Germany’s Federal Cyber Security Bureau and the U.S. Army. The team is also working with other large enterprises that are using its tools to improve their computer vision models.</p>
<p>“Machine Learning (ML) is one of the core topics at SBB, as we see a huge potential in its application for an improved, intelligent and automated monitoring of our railway infrastructure,&#8221; said Dr. Ilir Fetai and Andre Roger, the leads of SBB&#8217;s AI team. &#8220;The project on robust and reliable AI with LatticeFlow, ETH, and Siemens has a crucial role in enabling us to fully exploit the advantages of using ML.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, LatticeFlow remains in early access. The team plans to use the funding to accelerate its product development and bring on new customers. The team also plans to build out a presence in the U.S. in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portland, Oregon-based <a href="https://conversahealth.com/">Conversa Health</a>, a virtual care and communication platform that helps health organizations stay in touch with their patients and customers, today announced that it has expanded its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/conversa-health-raises-12m-series-b-for-its-digital-health-platform/">Series B funding round</a> from $12 million to $20 million. The round is still co-led by Builders VC and Northwell Health&#8217;s venture arm Northwell Ventures. Additional investors include UH Ventures, the venture arm of University Hospitals and VC firms P5 <span class="il">Health</span> Ventures, Epic Ventures, StartUp <span class="il">Health</span> and Nassau Street Ventures, as well Genesis Merchant Capital and J-Ventures, which came in as new investors in this expanded round.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a recognition, especially with COVID, that the need for automated and virtual &#8212; which are two big trends in healthcare &#8212; were on the horizon but now the horizon has been pulled in because of COVID and the healthcare system recognizes that that&#8217;s going to be required to be able to allow access for patients and improve both the experience for patients and providers, and get better outcomes and do it at lower cost,&#8221; Conversa CEO Murray Brozinsky told me.</p>
<p>Brozinsky actually believes that within the next decade, 80% of care will be done remotely. This will allow for more personalized and evidence-based care, but it will also require investments in automation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Conversa links providers’ EHRs and other patient data to best-of-breed interactive digital care pathways and clinical analytics engine to automate care management 24&#215;7. This improves care plan adherence pre and post visit, reducing costs and generating better outcomes for patients,&#8221; said Builders VC partner and Conversa board member Mark Goldstein. &#8220;Conversa’s enterprise platform and library of digital pathways are used by providers to care for patients across their populations, as opposed to one-off point solutions. It fills an enormous gap in the market.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v0EMOHJEoC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/conversa-health-raises-12m-series-b-for-its-digital-health-platform/">Conversa Health raises $12M Series B for its digital health platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Conversa Health raises $12M Series B for its digital health platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/conversa-health-raises-12m-series-b-for-its-digital-health-platform/embed/#?secret=v0EMOHJEoC" data-secret="v0EMOHJEoC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Given the pandemic, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that Conversa&#8217;s business also boomed. The number of customers the company its services has grown fourfold while its financial metrics are up 6x because a lot of its larger companies have expanded their use of the platform.</p>
<p>The team decided to expand the existing Series B round to help it capitalize on this momentum and to bring on more engineers in order to scale the platform. Brozinsky believes that the need for a platform like Conversa&#8217;s will remain after the pandemic ends. In addition, the company is also already rolling out support for vaccination programs in its service to help educate consumers but also help in monitoring efforts after people get their shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we&#8217;re hearing from health systems, they recognize that they need to be prepared for this to happen again, they still need to care for the core demographics that haven&#8217;t changed &#8212; this aging population &#8212; with an acute shortage of healthcare workers,&#8221; Brozinsky said. &#8220;So the need for the systems and these platforms is going to be more acute and the investment is not so much an additional cost but an enormous return.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getcare.khealth.ai">K Health</a>, the virtual health care provider that uses machine learning to lower the cost of care by providing the bulk of the company&#8217;s health assessments, is launching new tools for childcare on the heels of raising cash that values the company at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The $132 million round raised in December will help the company expand and help pay for upgrades including an integration with most electronic health records &#8212; an integration that&#8217;s expected by the second quarter.</p>
<p>Throughout 2020 K Health has leveraged its position operating at the intersection of machine learning and consumer healthcare to raised $222 million in a single year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This appetite from investors shows how large the opportunity is in consumer healthcare as companies look to use technology to make care more affordable.</p>
<p>For K Health, that means a monthly subscription to its service of $9 for unlimited access to the service and physicians on the platform, as well as a $19 per-month virtual mental health offering and a $19 fee for a one-time urgent care consultation.</p>
<p>To patients and investors the pitch is that the data K Health has managed to acquire through partnerships with organizations like the Israel health maintenance organization <a href="https://www.maccabi4u.co.il/1781-he/Maccabi.aspx">Maccabi Healthcare Services</a>, which gave up decades of anonymized data on patients and health outcomes to train K Health&#8217;s predictive algorithm, can assess patients and aid the in diagnoses for the company&#8217;s doctors.</p>
<p>In theory that means the company&#8217;s service essentially acts as a virtual primary care physician, holding a wealth of patient information that, when taken together, might be able to spot underlying medical conditions faster or provide a more holistic view into patient care.</p>
<p>For pharmaceutical companies that could mean insights into population health that could be potentially profitable avenues for drug discovery.</p>
<p>In practice, patients get what they pay for.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mental health offering uses medical doctors who are not licensed psychiatrists to perform their evaluations and assessments, according to one provider on the platform, which can lead to interactions with untrained physicians that can cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>While company chief executive Allon Bloch is likely correct in his assessment that most services can be performed remotely (Bloch puts the figure at 90%), they should be performed remotely by professionals who have the necessary training.</p>
<p>There are limits to how much heavy lifting an algorithm or a generalist should do when it comes to healthcare, and it appears that K Health wants to push those limits.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Drug referrals, acute issues, prevention issues, most of those can be done remotely,&#8221; Bloch said. &#8220;There’s an opportunity to do much better and potentially cheaper. </span></p>
<p>K Health has already seen hundreds of thousands of patients either through its urgent care offering or its subscription service and generated tens of millions in revenue in 2020, according to Bloch. He declined to disclose how many patients used the urgent care service vs. the monthly subscription offering.</p>
<p>Telemedicine companies, like other companies providing services remotely, have thrived during the pandemic. Teladoc and Amwell, two of the early pioneers in virtual medicine have seen their share prices soar. Companies like Hims, that provide prescriptions for elective conditions that aren&#8217;t necessarily covered by health, special purpose acquisition companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/hims-inks-1-6-billion-deal-to-go-public-via-oaktree-spac?sref=AwwRcx4b">at valuations of $1.6 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Backing K Health are a group of investors led by GGV Capital and Valor Equity Partners. Kaiser Permanente&#8217;s pension fund and the investment offices of the owners of 3G Capital (the Brazilian investment firm that owns Burger King and Kraft Heinz), along with <span style="font-weight: 400;">14W, Max Ventures, Pico Partners, Marcy Venture Partners, Primary Venture Partners and BoxGroup, also participated in the round. </span></p>
<p>Organizations working with the company include Maccabi Healthcare; the Mayo Clinic, which is investigating virtual care models with the company; and Anthem, which has white labeled the K Health service and provides it to some of the insurer&#8217;s millions of members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has hastened a shift of most commerce becoming e-commerce in the last year, and that has brought a new focus on startups that are helping to enable that process.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="http://ppro.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPRO</a>, a London-based startup that has built a platform to make it easier for marketplaces, payment providers and other e-commerce players to enable localised payments &#8212; that is, make and take payments in whatever form local customers prefer to use, which extend well beyond basic payment cards &#8212; has closed a round of $180 million, funding that catapults PPRO&#8217;s valuation to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>PPRO (pronounced &#8220;P-pro&#8221;, as in payments professionals) plans to use the funding to continue expanding in newer markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Simon Black, PPRO&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview that two particular areas of focus in the coming year will be more activity in Asian countries like Singapore and Indonesia, as well as Latin America, where the company acquired a local player, <a href="https://www.ppro.com/news/ppro-acquires-allpago-to-become-the-market-leader-in-local-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allpago</a>, back in 2019.</p>
<p>In both cases, the opportunity comes in the form of high growth stemming from more transactions moving online, as well as the chaos that is the fragmented payments market.</p>
<p>The capital is coming from a group of investors that includes Eurazeo Growth, Sprints Capital, and Wellington Management. It comes on the heels of a $50 million round the company<a href="https://www.ppro.com/news/ppro-announces-85-volume-growth-despite-pandemic-accelerates-plans-with-new-investment-from-sprints-and-citi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> raised last August</a> from Sprints, along with Citi and HPE Growth; and a further <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/paypal-leads-50m-round-for-cross-border-payment-specialist-ppro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$50 million it picked up in 2018</a> led by strategic investor PayPal.</p>
<p>PayPal, alongside Citi, Mastercard Payment Gateway Services, Mollie, and Worldpay are among PPRO&#8217;s 100 large global customers, which use the company&#8217;s APIs for a variety of functions, including localised gateway, processing and merchant acquirer services.</p>
<p>The flood of activity coming from consumers and businesses buying more online &#8212; a by-product of the pandemic leading to many businesses shutting down physical operations for the moment &#8212; has seen the company double transaction volumes between Q4 2020 and the same quarter in 2019.</p>
<p>PPRO is not the only company to be targeting that opportunity.</p>
<p>The fragmentation of financial services overall &#8212; where realistically, there is only handful of types of transactions that might be made (usually: deposits, payments, credit), but quite literally thousands of permutations and methods to make them, with specific markets and their populations typically coalescing around their own localised selections.</p>
<p>That has led to the rise of a number of companies providing what has come to be called &#8220;banking as a service&#8221; or &#8220;fintech as a service,&#8221; where a tech provider stitches together in the background a number of services, sometimes thousands, and makes it easier for their customers, by way of an API, to plug those services in for their own customers to use more easily, most often connected to a range of other services provided to them like money management.</p>
<p>Others in this wider space that includes payments and other fintech services include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapyd</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a>, <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a>, Adyen, Stripe and newer players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unit</a>, with many of these raising large amounts of money in recent times in particular to double down on what is currently a rapidly expanding market.</p>
<p>The unique aspect of PPRO is that it was an early mover in the area of identifying the conundrum of fragmentation in payments for companies that operate in more than one country or region, and that it has continued to play only in payments, without a jump to adjacent services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re ultra focused because the local payments problem is actually growing,&#8221; said Black, who believes that &#8220;the disconnect between what a consumer wants to use, but also their appetite and the proliferation of payment options&#8221; all contribute to more complexity (with the trade-off being more choices for consumers, but equally possibly too much choice?).</p>
<p>As Black sees it, the company&#8217;s focus on payments has given it more momentum to build better tech specifically to address that globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;PPRO is building solutions for performance in industrial strength. It’s growing rapidly because there are no other players that are truly global. We are globalizing to support the needs of customers who want to nationalize, so we have an opportunity to focus on payments, to be a strategic outsource partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t room for product expansion: alongside payments, Black highlighted product compliance and providing better analytics as two areas where the company is already active and will be doing more for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we partner and provide value is in anticipating changes in consumer demand,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;We monitor how customers are using those methods and &#8212; whether you are are service provider or furniture or travel company &#8212; determine which are the best relevant payment methods.&#8221; Services like open banking, tools for banks to enable allowing payments directly from customers&#8217; accounts, or buy-now-pay-later payments, are examples, he said, of areas that speak of further opportunities.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Simon and the team at PPRO as they continue to develop best-in-class local payment solutions,” commented Nathalie Kornhoff-Brüls, Managing Director at Eurazeo Growth, in a statement. “All signs for the future indicate that digital commerce, and even more so cross-border commerce, will continue to grow exponentially while innovation in payment methods remains strong. As a result, facilitating local payments is becoming increasingly complex. Payment service providers, however, no longer have a choice as merchants and their customers are pushing for the adoption.”</p>
<p>“PPRO has proven to be the go-to problem solver in this area, providing the local payments technology and expertise that the world’s biggest payment players rely on. Our investment reflects our confidence in the growth potential for PPRO and we’re excited to support PPRO and its team on their journey,” added Voria Fattahi, a partner at Sprints Capital, in a separate statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our &lt;a href=&#8221;https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6”>survey of VCs in Athens, Greece will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Greece&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>

<p>You are not in Greece, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has asked WhatsApp to withdraw the planned change to its privacy policy, posing a new headache to Facebook-owned service that identifies the South Asian nation as its biggest market by users.</p>
<p>In an email to WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, the nation&#8217;s IT ministry said the upcoming update to the app&#8217;s data-sharing policy has raised “grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens&#8230; Therefore, you are called upon to withdraw the proposed changes.”</p>
<p>The ministry is additionally seeking clarification from WhatsApp on its data-sharing agreement with Facebook and other commercial firms and has asked why users in the EU are exempt from the new privacy policy but their counterpoint in India have no choice but to comply.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Such a differential treatment is prejudicial to the interests of Indian users and is viewed with serious concern by the government,&#8221; the ministry wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by TechCrunch. &#8220;The government of India owes a sovereign responsibility to its citizens to ensure that their interests are not compromised and therefore it calls upon WhatsApp to respond to concerns raised in this letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through an in-app alert earlier this month, WhatsApp had asked users to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users were initially provided until February 8 to comply with the new policy if they wished to continue using the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;This &#8216;all-or-nothing&#8217; approach takes away any meaningful choice from Indian users. This approach leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain, which may infringe on their interests in relation to informational privacy and information security,&#8221; the ministry said in the email.</p>

<p>The notification from WhatsApp prompted a lot of confusion &#8212; and in some cases, anger and frustration &#8212; among its users, many of which have explored alternative messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal in recent weeks.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014</a>, has been sharing some limited information about its users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">with the social giant since 2016</a> — and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this. Responding to the backlash last week, the Facebook-owned app, which serves more than 2 billion users worldwide, said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">deferring the enforcement of the planned policy</a> to May 15.</p>
<p>WhatsApp also ran front-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">amassed over 450 million users</a>, last week to explain the changes and debunk some rumors.</p>
<p>New Delhi also shared disappointment with the timing of this update, which to be fair WhatsApp unveiled last year. The ministry &gt;said that it was reviewing the Personal Data Protection Bill, a monumental privacy bill that is meant to oversee how data of users are shared with the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the Parliament is seized of the issue, making such a momentous change for Indian users at this time puts the cart before the horse. Since the Personal Data Protection Bill strongly follows the principle of &#8216;purpose limitation,&#8217; these changes may lead to significant implementational challenges for WhatsApp should the Bill become an Act,&#8221; the letter said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, India&#8217;s IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also offered a loud advice to Facebook. &#8220;Be it WhatsApp, be it Facebook, be it any digital platform. You are free to do business in India but do it in a manner without impinging upon the rights of Indians who operate there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s Glovo, an on-demand delivery app, has announced a strategic partnership with Swiss-based real estate firm, Stoneweg.</p>
<p>The deal will see the latter invest €100M in building and refurbishing &#8220;prime city real estate&#8221; in some of Glovo&#8217;s key markets as the delivery app works to build out its network of dark stores and sign up more retail partners for its urban delivery service, it said today.</p>
<p>The initial focus for the partnership will be on growing its dark stores network in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Romania, with additional countries slated as under review in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These are the countries in which both Glovo and Stoneweg have a major presence, and therefore are able to move much quicker when it comes to setting up,&#8221; a Glovo spokeswoman told us. &#8220;However, the deal is not limited to these countries. Glovo’s aim is to grow and strengthen their Q-Commerce and dark kitchens infrastructure across Eastern Europe too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glovo currently operates 18 dark stores globally &#8212; in cities including Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon and Milan &#8212; but said it&#8217;s now looking to open similar stores in Valencia, Rome, Porto and Bucharest, among others.</p>
<p>It wants to have 100 dark stores up and running by the end of 2021, it added.</p>
<p>Last September the startup announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">sale of its LatAm ops to food-delivery focused rival Delivery Hero for $272M</a> &#8212; leaving it more fully focused on Southern and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/on-demand-delivery-app-glovo-is-spinning-up-a-b2b-logistics-unit-for-super-speedy-urban-delivery/">November</a> it announced the launch of a dedicated business unit to support expansion of the sub-30 minute urban delivery service, which it calls &#8216;Q-Commerce&#8217; (that&#8217;s &#8216;Q&#8217; for quick) &#8212; saying it would accelerate development of a b2b offering to stock third parties&#8217; products in its city center warehouses (and have them delivered to shoppers via the couriers doing gig work on its platform).</p>
<p>Glovo said today that the Stoneweg strategic partnership will help it step on the gas to grow the infrastructure and fulfilment centers it needs to underpin this b2b offering.</p>

<p>The &#8216;deliver anything&#8217; app is spying an opportunity to capitalize on the coronavirus&#8217; impact on traditional bricks-and-mortar retail &#8212; betting urban consumers will make a permanent shift to outsourcing grocery and other convenience/essential shops to an app which bundles high speed delivery, rather than making such trips in person.</p>
<p>Its dialled-up focus on Q-Commerce is a direct response to &#8220;changing consumer sentiment and demand for instant and same-day delivery&#8221;, it added.</p>
<p>To date, Glovo&#8217;s platform has delivered more than 12 million multi-category orders globally, while in 2020 it experienced a growth rate of more than 300% year-on-year.</p>
<p>As well as supermarkets such as Carrefour, Continente, and Kaufland, Glovo&#8217;s list of retail partners includes the likes of Unilever, Nestle and L’Oréal, and IKEA &#8212; so it&#8217;s by no means focused purely on groceries.</p>
<p>It has said it wants Q-Commerce to power delivery of a wide range of products — from toys, music, books, flowers and beauty products to pharmacy items and groceries. And even, in some markets, a <a href="https://glovoapp.com/en/buc/store/test-ikea-buc1/">curated selected of IKEA wares</a> &#8212; i.e. stuff that&#8217;s small enough to fit in couriers&#8217; backpacks.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Stoneweg strategic investment in a statement, Oscar Pierre, co-founder and CEO, said: “We believe that the third-generation of commerce is already upon us. Following the close of Stoneweg’s investment, we are consolidating our strategic commitment to Q-Commerce, which will allow us to better connect people with a wide variety of available products in their cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the wake of COVID-19, we believe that dark stores represent the future of post-pandemic retail, and I think we’ll see a permanent shift in consumer habits towards same-day and instant delivery. We’re excited to continue to expand our offering, so that all types of businesses, from local independent stores to multi-national chains, can reach more and more customers thanks to new technological solutions and highly efficient infrastructure.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Stoneweg&#8217;s Joaquín Castellví, founding partner and head of acquisitions for Europe, added that the strategic investment represents &#8220;an opportunity to offer our clients to diversify into a new class of retail asset through consolidated cities where Glovo operates &#8212; in a segment with great growth potential, accelerated by the situation we are experiencing&#8221;.</p>

<p>Glovo&#8217;s push to take a margin on a broad range of urban retail comes at a time when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/takeaway-and-just-eat-to-merge-in-10b-deal-to-take-on-deliveroo-and-uber-eats-in-europe/">consolidation</a> is eating into the thin margin food delivery space.</p>
<p>It is also facing legal challenges to its business model in Europe over the classification of couriers as self-employed &#8212; losing a supreme court ruling in its home market last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">September</a>.</p>
<p>Ministers in Spain are working on a new regulatory framework for delivery apps and Glovo has said it&#8217;s awaiting that reform before making any changes but a lot will be riding on the detail.</p>
<p>UK-based Deliveroo also recently lost a legal challenge in Spain over the classification of its couriers. A court in Barcelona found <a href="https://www.elperiodico.com/es/economia/20210112/deliveroo-pierde-macrojuicio-bcn-748-11449779">last week</a> that the company had falsely defined 748 riders as self employed, following a 2018 workplace inspection.</p>
<p>The delivery platform which competes with Glovo in the on-demand food and grocery space, <a href="https://uk.deliveroo.news/news/deliveroo-growth-funding-2021.html">announced</a> Sunday the closing of a Series H funding round &#8212; raising $180M+ from existing investors, led by Durable Capital Partners LP and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, which it said valued the business at over $7BN.</p>
<p>The investment would enable Deliveroo to continue investing in &#8220;developing the best proposition for consumers, riders and restaurants&#8221;, it said, noting that it would be expanding in on-demand grocery following &#8220;rapid&#8221; growth over the last year.</p>
<p>Deliveroo added that the Series H investment comes ahead of a &#8220;potential&#8221; IPO &#8212; and said it &#8220;reflects strong demand from existing shareholders to invest in the company, given the significant growth potential in the online food delivery sector in which consumer adoption is accelerating&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup based out of San Diego and Taipei is quietly nailing fundings and deals from some of the biggest names in electronics. <a href="https://www.kneron.com/">Kneron</a>, which specializes in energy-efficient processors for edge artificial intelligence, just raised a strategic funding round from Taiwan&#8217;s manufacturing giant Foxconn and integrated circuit producer Winbond.</p>
<p>The deal came a year after Kneron closed a <a href="https://www.kneron.com/news/blog/89/">$40 million round</a> led by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s Horizons Ventures. Amongst its other prominent investors are Alibaba Entrepreneurship Fund, Sequoia Capital, Qualcomm and SparkLabs Taipei.</p>
<p>Kneron declined to disclose the dollar amount of the investment from Foxconn and Winbond due to investor requests but said it was an &#8220;eight figures&#8221; deal, founder and CEO Albert Liu told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2015, Kneron&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/kneron-launches-its-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-google-and-others/">latest product</a> is a neural processing unit that can enable sophisticated AI applications without relying on the cloud. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is directly taking on the chips of Intel and Google, which it claims are more energy-consuming than its offering. The startup recently got a talent boost after hiring Davis Chen, Qualcomm&#8217;s former Taipei head of engineering.</span></p>
<p>Among Kneron&#8217;s customers are Chinese air conditioning giant Gree and German&#8217;s autonomous driving software provider Teraki, and the new deal is turning the world&#8217;s largest electronics manufacturer into a client. As part of the strategic agreement, Kneron will work with Foxconn on the latter&#8217;s smart manufacturing and newly introduced <a href="https://www.foxconn.com/en-us/press-center/press-releases/latest-news/456">open platform for electric vehicles</a>, while its work with Winbond will focus on microcontroller unit (MCU)-based AI and memory computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-power AI chips are pretty easy to put into sensors. We all know that in some operation lines, sensors are quite small, so it&#8217;s not easy to use a big GPU [graphics processing unit] or CPU [central processing unit], especially when power consumption is a big concern,&#8221; said Liu, who held R&amp;D positions at Qualcomm and Samsung before founding Kneron.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Unlike some of its competitors, Kneron designs chips for a wide range of use cases, from manufacturing, smart home, smartphones, robotics, surveillance, payments, to autonomous driving. It doesn&#8217;t just make chips but also the AI software embedded in the chips, a strategy that Liu said differentiates his company from China&#8217;s AI darlings like SenseTime and Megvii, which enable AI service through the cloud.</span></p>
<p>Kneron has also been on a less aggressive funding pace than these companies, which fuel their rapid expansion through outsize financing rounds. Six-year-old SenseTime has raised about<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sensetime"> $2.6 billion</a> to date, while nine-year-old Megvii has banked about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/megvii-technology">$1.4 billion</a>. Kneron, in comparison, has raised just over<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> $70 million from a Series A round.</span></p>
<p>Like the Chinese AI upstarts, Kneron is weighing an initial public offering. The company is expected to make a profit in 2023, Liu said, and &#8220;that will probably be a good time for us to go IPO.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is writing check to another startup in India. The Android-maker, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">unveiled a $10 billion fund</a> to invest in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, said on Tuesday that it is participating in a $40 million investment round of hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo, a Bangalore-based firm that it has also previously backed.</p>
<p>Five-year-old <a href="https://www.dunzo.com/">Dunzo</a> said Google, Lightbox, Evolvence, Hana Financial Investment, LGT Lightstone Aspada, and Alteria among others participated in its Series E financing round, which brings its to-date raise to $121 million.</p>
<p>Dunzo operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/04/dunzo-hyperlocal-ecommerce-delivery/">eponymous hyper-local delivery service</a> in nearly a dozen cities in India including Bangalore, Delhi, Noida, Pune, Gurgaon, Powai, Hyderabad and Chennai. Users get access to a wide-range of items across several categories, from grocery, perishables, pet supplies and medicines to dinner from their neighborhood stores and restaurants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>E-commerce accounts for less than 3% of all retail sales in India, according to industry estimates. Mom and pop stores and other neighborhood outlets that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns, villages and slums across the country drive most of the sales in the nation. The way Dunzo has grown, it poses a challenge to e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, as well as local food and grocery delivery startups such as Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket, and Grofers. Several people also use Dunzo to pick up and move random items such as a laptop charger or wallet or a lunch box from one point in the city to another.</p>
<p>&#8220;As merchants go digital, Dunzo is helping small businesses in their digital transformation journey in support of business recovery,&#8221; said Caesar Sengupta, VP, Google, in a statement. &#8220;Through our India Digitization Fund, we’re committed to partnering with India’s innovative startups to build a truly inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kabeer Biswas, chief executive and co-founder of Dunzo the startup has grown its annual gross merchandise value business to about $100 million. (GMV used to a popular metric that several e-commerce firms relied on to demonstrate their growth, however, it&#8217;s one of the meaningless ways to gauge a startup&#8217;s growth. Most firms have stopped using GMV. Additionally, when a startup speaks GMV language, traditionally it has meant they are anything but close to profitability, which happens to be true in the case of Dunzo.)</p>
<p>“Dunzo&#8217;s mission resonated stronger than ever in 2020. We have been amazed by everything merchants and users have started to depend on the platform for. We truly believe we are writing a playbook for how hyperlocal businesses can be built with sustainable unit economics and capital responsibility. As a team, we are more focused than ever to enable local Merchants to get closer to their Users and build one of the most loved consumer brands in the country,&#8221; Biswas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Google, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">invested $4.5 billion in Jio Platforms</a> last year, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed social news app Dailyhunt and Glance</a>, a part of ad giant InMobi Group that is aggressively expanding ways to populate content on Android users&#8217; lockscreen. Google is also in talks with local social media ShareChat and may alone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">invest more than $100 million in the Indian startup</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier this month. Talks about Google&#8217;s interest in ShareChat has previously also been reported by local media houses Economic Times and ET Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> is generating 100% of its revenue from health insurance products — and that isn’t going to change. But the company wants to start a conversation with a bigger use base. Alan is going to launch multiple mobile apps that let you learn more about health topics, contact a doctor and chat with the community.</p>
<p>“We are proud to announce today that we’re launching free medical apps for everyone,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve said in a virtual press conference. “We’re going to develop services for specific groups of people who are facing specific issues or questions.”</p>
<p>And the company is starting with Alan Baby. As you can guess from the name, Alan Baby helps you stay on top of your baby’s health. The company has chosen to focus on that segment as your baby’s health can be a great source of mental stress.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you first open the app, you get a feed of articles on specific topics, from sleep to nutrition and child development. You can get relevant articles by entering the birthdate of your child as you often don’t have the same questions at day one and day 100.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about data, Alan says that it doesn&#8217;t leverage data for its insurance products — you can optionally enter the age in Alan Baby to customize content but that&#8217;s it. Health insurance companies in France don&#8217;t have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to data. Companies sign a health insurance contract for their employees. Insurance companies can&#8217;t accept or deny someone after that. They can&#8217;t set a higher price due to medial history.</p>
<p>While parents usually have 10 pediatrician appointments in the first year, you may have a burning question that cannot wait that long. From Alan Baby, you can start a text discussion with a doctor. The company says users should expect an answer within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Alan had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/health-insurance-startup-alan-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor/">hired doctors</a> for a similar messaging feature for its users who are covered under the health insurance products. The company is opening up that feature to more users beyond its paid customers.</p>
<p>Finally, people who install Alan Baby can interact with each other in the community section. It works a bit like an online forum on health topics, except that it’s mobile-first and Alan wants to moderate it with some help from its doctors.</p>
<p>“Thanks to what we’re setting up for parents, we will be able to extend it to other topics soon,” Samuelian-Werve said. He names fertility, mental health or diabetes as potential topics for other free apps.</p>
<p>While the apps are going to be free, the company expects to attract new clients for its health insurance thanks to those new apps. Essentially, Alan is broadening the top of its sales funnel with free apps.</p>
<p>Alan Baby is rolling out progressively in France. There’s <a href="https://waitlist.alan.com">a waitlist</a> and the iOS app is available to pre-order (for free) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/alan-baby-la-sant%C3%A9-du-b%C3%A9b%C3%A9/id1542332694">in the App Store</a>.</p>
<h2>An update on the health insurance products</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/health-insurance-startup-alan-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor/">Back in October</a>, Samuelian-Werve told me that 100,000 were covered through Alan. A few months later, 139,000 people are covered through one Alan insurance product or another. Overall, 8,300 companies have chosen the company as their health insurance provider. Basically, Alan’s user base has more than doubled in 2020.</p>
<p>In France, employees are covered by both the national healthcare system and private insurance companies. So Alan convinces other companies to use its product for its employees. The company has obtained its own health insurance license, which means that it can customize its health insurance products completely depending on the segment and client.</p>
<p>The company is also operating in Spain and Belgium. But it’s been a slow start with 300 members in Spain and 500 members in Belgium. Alan is going to focus on those two markets before launching new countries in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent&#8217;s WeChat Pay and Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate Alipay have long dominated digital payments in China, but they have always faced new challengers. The latest entrant in online payments is Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version.</p>
<p>The short video app recently added &#8220;Douyin Pay&#8221; to its list of existing payment options, which have included Alipay and WeChat Pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The set-up of Douyin Pay (Douyin Zhifu) is to supplement the existing major payment options, and to ultimately enhance user experience on Douyin,&#8221; a Douyin spokesperson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Payment is a natural step for Douyin, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/bytedance-valuation-under-huge-pressure-as-tiktok-sale-nears/">has a growing e-commerce business</a>. Users can be directed to a product link while watching a video of an influencer reviewing, say, a lipstick. Instead of the ubiquitous WeChat Pay and Alipay, they may opt for Douyin Pay one day, if the incentives are great enough.</p>
<p>Other internet giants, such as e-commerce giant JD.com and food delivery service Meituan, have also tried luring people to use their own payment methods, though the market duopoly is hard to break. All in all, Alipay and WeChat Pay handle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">about 90%</a> of China&#8217;s electronic payments.</p>
<p>Like other internet firms, Douyin parent ByteDance snapped up a coveted payments license by acquiring a third-party payments firm. Last September, a company controlled by ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming bought out a payments solution provider called Wuhan Hezhong Yibao Technology Co. The license, in turn, allows Douyin, Toutiao and other ByteDance services to offer payment features.</p>
<p>Users can, for instance, receive a cash-filled electronic red packet from a Douyin campaign and deposit that cash to their bank accounts.</p>

<p>The rollout of Douyin Pay seems well-timed with the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, a time when families and friends gift each other red packets. Over the past decade, WeChat has been popularizing electronic versions of these auspicious money-filled envelopes, which helped WeChat Pay take off in the early days.</p>
<p>Douyin inked a deal with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV to be its red envelope technology provider for the Spring Festival Gala, traditionally a major advertising event of the year, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Dr4zy3cXC7oOUjcD2yPAMA">according to</a> Chinese business news provider LatePost. Alibaba&#8217;s young rival Pinduoduo <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3103040/pinduoduo-lands-exclusive-red-packet-partnership-cctv-2021-spring">had a similar deal</a> last year in an attempt to grow its own payments users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.skyqraft.com/">Skyqraft</a>, the Swedish startup using AI and drones for electricity powerline inspection, has raised $2.2 million in seed funding, capital it will use to further develop its technology and expand its operations in Europe and in the U.S.</p>
<p>Leading the seed round is Subvenio Invest, with participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/antler/">pre-seed backer Antler</a>, Next Human Ventures, and unnamed angel investors.</p>
<p>Founded in March 2019 and launched that September, Skyqraft provides what it calls “smart” infrastructure inspections for powerlines. It uses drones, combined with AI, to gather images and detect risk automatically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is in contrast to the status quo, where power-lines are typically inspected by teams of people and helicopters, which is time consuming and potentially dangerous. The idea behind Skyqraft is to enable safer powerline inspections in a more cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xIwYmQkynJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/skyqraft/">Skyqraft, a startup using AI and drones for electricity power-line inspection, raises $505K</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Skyqraft, a startup using AI and drones for electricity power-line inspection, raises $505K&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/skyqraft/embed/#?secret=xIwYmQkynJ" data-secret="xIwYmQkynJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Power-line inspections most importantly are not environmentally friendly, very costly and unsafe with the use of helicopters and people,” Skyqraft co-founder and CMO Sakina Turabali told TechCrunch when Skyqraft announced its pre-seed funding. “We provide smart infrastructure inspections using unmanned airplanes by gathering images and 360 videos and feeding that data into a machine learning system that automatically detects any risk to the power-lines.”</p>
<p>Skyqraft says the system can process high volumes of image data and is able to detect equipment issues “rapidly and with high accuracy”. By using Skyqraft, the Swedish company claims utility companies can shorten a 25km powerline inspection from two days to “three minutes”.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2097675" style="width: 1634px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2097675" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2097675 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png" alt="" width="1624" height="750" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png 1624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=1536,709 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/0.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1624px) 100vw, 1624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2097675" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skyqraft</p></div></p>
<p>That proposition appears to already be resonating with customers, which include the three largest utility companies in Sweden jointly representing 85% of the Swedish market. Additionally, Skyqraft says it is also negotiating a series of larger scale pilots in the U.S. in 2021 with the global utility company Iberdrola.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://leocare.eu">LeoCare</a> has raised a €15 million funding round. Felix Capital, Ventech and Daphni are participating in today’s funding round. The company is selling a portfolio of insurance products with a focus on the signup process and user experience. You can control your insurance products from a mobile app.</p>
<p>Chances are you already pay for multiple insurance products. But when is the last time you checked your coverage and adjusted your contract? When people sign up to a new insurance product, they tend to set it and forget it.</p>
<p>That’s why insurance companies don’t invest a ton of money on mobile apps, control panels and user-facing features. LeoCare believes there’s room for a player that does the opposite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LeoCare can insure your home, your car, your motorbike and your smartphone. You can sign up from the company’s website or install a mobile app. The company has tried to optimize the onboarding process with easy-to-understand questions and an indicator that tells you if you’re going to pay a bit more or a lot more if you choose one option or another.</p>
<p>When you sign up, you get your insurance contract right away. This way, you can send it to a landlord a few minutes later. But LeoCare also helps you manage your contract later down the road. For instance, many LeoCare customers chose to lower their car insurance premiums during lockdown. You can also add another driver for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, LeoCare acts as a managing general agent. The startup partners with several insurance companies and sells its insurance products under its own brand. The company currently charges €1 million in premiums per month and has 20,000 customers.</p>
<p>63% of contracts cover a car, 26% of contracts cover a home, 7% of contracts are for motorcyclists and 4% of contracts focus on smartphones. And LeoCare is growing rapidly with a current month-over-month growth rate of 38%.</p>
<p>Up next, the company wants to launch new features, such as a bot that lets you check the status of your case. LeoCare is also working on a feature that lets you receive a notification when you’re driving and there are usually a lot of road accidents in the area.</p>
<p>Finally, the startup wants to launch a marketplace of professionals. This could be helpful if you’re looking for a plumber for instance. And it could represent a new revenue stream for the startup.</p>
<p>LeoCare plans to grow its insurance portfolio sevenfold by the end of 2021. The team will also grow from 35 to 80 people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once overlooked, agritech startups are beginning to have a moment in India.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://agrevolution.in/">DeHaat</a>, an online platform that offers full-stack agricultural services to farmers, said it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as the Indian firm looks to maintain its accelerated growth despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Prosus Ventures, formerly known as Naspers Ventures, led Patna and Gurgaon-based startup’s Series C financing round. RTP Global and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, FMO, Omnivore and AgFunder also participated in it, bringing the startup’s to-date raise to over $46 million. (Dexter Capital was the advisor for this funding round.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the biggest challenges farmers in India face is securing agri-input items such as seeds and fertilizers and then finding buyers after producing the yields.</p>
<p>DeHaat, which is Hindi for village, is solving this by bringing brands, institutional financers and buyers to one platform, which is accessible through a helpline and an app in local languages.</p>
<p>Only about a third of the yields Indian farmers produce reaches the big markets, according to industry estimates. It&#8217;s traditionally proven immensely difficult for farmers to find buyers for their produce.</p>
<p>Once the season is over, DeHaat helps farmers sell their yields to bulk buyers such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">business-to-business marketplace Udaan</a>, Reliance Fresh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">food delivery firm Zomato</a>.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old startup has also developed a database of crop tests and uses artificial intelligence to provide farmers with free-of-cost personalized advisory on what they should sow in a season. DeHaat also helps farmers secure working capital through partnership with hundreds of institutional firms.</p>
<p>We wrote about DeHaat last year, when it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/agritech-startup-dehaat-raises-12m-to-reach-more-farmers-in-india/">raised a $12 million financing round</a>. The past nine months has been the story of its accelerated growth despite the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted lockdowns across the nation for several months.</p>
<p>The startup, which today has presence in eastern part of India — states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal &#8212; serves close to 400,000 farmers, up from about 210,000 in April last year, Shashank Kumar, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>How the startup is tackling these challenges is equally impressive. It works with nearly 1,400 micro-entrepreneurs, up from about 400 last year, in rural areas who distribute over 4,000 types of agri-input goods to farmers from their regional hubs and then bring back the output to the same hub. “They are the ones responsible for last-mile delivery and aggregation,” he said.</p>
<p>DeHaat has grown on every front, including the revenue it clocks, which is up 3X to 3.5X since last year, he said.</p>
<p>“At the end of March, our daily volume out was around 200 metric tonne. Now it’s over 600 metric tonne. Everyday we aggregate this much from farmers and supply to FMCG players and modern retails. Similarly on the agri-input side &#8212; seed, fertilizers, and pesticide &#8212; we are processing close to 10,000 orders everyday, compared to about 2,600 in March of last year,” he said.</p>
<p>“Prosus Ventures invests in industries around the world where innovation can significantly address big societal needs,” said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of India Investments at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>“DeHaat is catering to a massive market in India with the agriculture sector worth more than $350 billion to the country’s economy and consisting of an estimated 140 million+ farmers. Through its end-to-end agricultural services offerings, DeHaat will have a major societal impact in India, improving the earning potential for Indian farmers and overall yield for the sector while also enabling microentrepreneurs all over the country, including in rural areas where there is often less income opportunity,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to more states in India including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra and eventually serve 10 million farmers.</p>
<p>And another area where it intends to focus is hiring top tech talent. The startup has doubled its workforce since the past year, with many high-profile hires from major firms. The startup, which recently made its second acquisition, is also open to exploring more M&amp;A opportunities, said DeHaat&#8217;s Shashank Kumar.</p>
<p>Once ignored, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/urbankisaan-is-betting-on-vertical-farming-to-bring-pesticide-free-vegetables-to-consumers-and-fight-indias-water-crisis/">scores of agritech startups</a> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/arya-raises-21-million-for-its-agritech-and-finance-platform/">cropped up</a> in India in recent years &#8212; and many old startups are beginning to receive large-sized checks from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Darwinbox, which operates a cloud-based human resource management platform, has raised $15 million in a new financing round as the Indian startup looks to further expand in the country and Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series C &#8212; for the Hyderabad-headquartered startup was led by Salesforce Ventures, the venture arm of the American enterprise giant. This is Salesforce Ventures’ one of rare investments in Asia. Existing investors including Lightspeed India and Sequoia Capital India also participated in the round, which brings the five-year old startup’s raise to-date to about $35 million.</p>
<p>Over 500 firms including &#8212; Tokopedia, Indorama, JG Summit Group, Zilingo, Zalora, Fave, Adani, Mahindra, Kotak, TVS, National Stock Exchange, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, Dr.Reddy’s, Nivea, Puma, Swiggy, Bigbasket &#8212; use <a href="https://darwinbox.com/">Darwinbox</a>’s HR platform to provide more than a million employees of theirs with a range of features in 60 nations, up from about 200 firms across 50 nations in late 2019, said Chaitanya Peddi, co-founder of Darwinbox, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peddi said the startup has always looked up to Salesforce for inspiration, and investment from the enterprise giant is &#8220;nothing sort of a child receiving validation from their father,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The fundraise caps the most successful year for the startup that started with uncertainty as the coronavirus spread across Asian nations. The startup initially took a hit as its customers scrambled to navigate through the global pandemic, but the last two quarters have been its best to date, said Peddi.</p>
<p>Overall, the startup&#8217;s revenue has ballooned by 300% since September 2019, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/india-darwinbox-raises-15m-to-bring-hr-tech-platform-to-more-asian-markets/">last raised money</a>, he said. &#8220;In HR tech and SaaS space, we are now only behind SAP and Oracle in India in terms of revenue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dev Khare, a partner at Lightspeed India, an early backer of the startup, said that Darwinbox has become the preferred human capital management solution for Asian conglomerates, governments, and high-growth businesses and multi-national corporations operating in Asia as they witness digital transformation.</p>

<p>Darwinbox&#8217;s platform is built to take care of the entire &#8220;hiring to retiring&#8221; cycle needs of employees. It handles onboarding of new hires, keeps a tab on their performance, monitors attrition rate, and provides an ongoing feedback loop.</p>
<p>It also provides its customers with a social network for their employees to remain connected with one another and an AI assistant to apply for a leave or set up meetings with quick voice commands from their phones.</p>
<p>Peddi said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand to several more countries, especially in more emerging markets in the Middle East Asia and Africa, and broaden its offerings. &#8220;We will be leveraging the power of our platform to do a lot more. We are a product-led firm and our focus will remain on innovation in that space,&#8221; he said. The startup is also open to exploring opportunities to acquire smaller firms for inorganic growth, he said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;India is home to one of the world&#8217;s youngest population, and by 2050, it is expected to account for over 18% of the global working age population,&#8221; said Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India, in a statement. &#8220;This makes technology platforms like Darwinbox, that focuses on workforces, incredibly important. I&#8217;m proud that Salesforce is supporting Darwinbox on their journey as they continue to grow and innovate in this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Kayyal, partner and head of international at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch in an interview that the firm helps its partners in a number of ways, including exposing them to the firm&#8217;s customers, executives and their networks, and helping startups scale their business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have one of the most innovative and disruptive customer bases that are looking for cloud solutions and digital transformation. So the opportunity to expose companies like Darwinbox to our customer base is something we get really excited about,&#8221; said Kayyal. Salesforce Ventures is exploring more investment opportunities in India, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.volopay.co/">Volopay</a>, a Singapore-based startup building a &#8220;financial control center&#8221; for businesses, announced today it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding. The round was led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, and included participation from Soma Capital, CP Ventures, Y Combinator, VentureSouq, the founders of Razorpay, Antler and other angel investors.</p>
<p>The funding will be used on hiring, product development, strategic partnerships and Volopay’s international expansion. It plans to launch operations in Australia later this month. The company currently has about 100 clients, including Smart Karma, Dathena, Medline, Sensorflow and Beam.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019 by Rajith Shaiji and Rajesh Raikwar, Volopay took part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program last year. It was created after chief executive officer Shaji, who worked for several fintech companies before launching Volopay, became frustrated by the process of reconciling business expenses, especially with accounting departments located in different countries. Shaiji and Raikwar also saw that many companies, especially startups and SMEs, struggled to track different kinds of spending, including subscriptions and vendor payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Most of Volopay’s clients are in the tech sector and have about 15 to 150 employees. Volopay’s platform integrates multicurrency corporate cards (issued by Visa Corporate), domestic and international bank transfers, automated payments and expense and accounting software, allowing companies to save money on foreign exchange fees and reconcile expenses more quickly.</p>
<p>In order to speed up its development, Volopay integrated Airwallex’s APIs. Its corporate cards offer up to 2% cash back on software subscriptions, hosting and international travel, which Volopay says are the three top expense categories for tech companies, and it in November 2020, it launched a credit facility for corporate cards to help give SMEs more liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional credit products, like credit cards and working capital loans, Shaji said Volopay’s credit facility, which is also issued by Visa Corporate, has a more competitive fixed-free pricing structure that depends on the level of credit used. This means companies know how much they owe in advance, which in turn helps them manage their cashflows more easily. The average credit line provided by Volopay is about $30,000.</p>
<p>Since TechCrunch last covered Volopay in July 2020, it has grown 70% month on month in terms of total funds flowing through its platform, Shaji said. It also launched two new features: A bill pay feature that allows clients to transfer money domestically and internationally with low foreign exchange rates and transaction fees, and the credit facility. The bill pay feature now contributes about 40% to Volopay’s total payment volume, while the credit product makes up 30% of its card spending.</p>
<p>Shaji told TechCrunch that Volopay decided to expand into Australia because because not only is it a much larger market than Singapore, but “SMEs in Australia are very comfortable using paid digital software to streamline internal operations and scale their businesses.” He added that there is currently no other provider in Australia that offers both expense management and credit to SMEs like Volopay.</p>
