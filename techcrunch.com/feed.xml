										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper satellite constellation is one step closer to actually making it to space: The company announced it has secured an agreement with the United Launch Alliance (ULA) to fly its satellites on nine Atlas V rocket launches. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">intends to use multiple launch providers and spacecraft</a> to ultimately get the full complement of 3,236 Kuiper satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO), but ULA is the first launch provider that Amazon has signed or announced.</p>
<p>ULA&#8217;s Atlas V is a proven workhorse in the space launch industry, having flown 85 prior missions with a perfect track record. The spacecraft was used to launch NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover, for example, as well as Lockheed Martin&#8217;s OSIRIS-REx robotic asteroid exploration craft. While Amazon and ULA detailed to total number of launch vehicles that the contract covers, they didn&#8217;t share a timeline about when we can expect the launches to take place.</p>

<p>Late last year, I spoke to Amazon SVP of Devices &amp; Services Dave Limp at our TC Sessions: Space events, and I asked him about timelines for launches. Limp said at the time that Amazon was about at the &#8220;middle of [its] design phase&#8221; for the Project Kuiper satellites, which indicates there&#8217;s still work to be done before they enter mass production, which would obviously precede launch.</p>
<p>Limp also pointed out that the clock is ticking for Amazon in terms of its FCC license to operate the constellation, so it essentially has to &#8220;have half [its] constellation up in about six years.&#8221; That will mean an aggressive launch schedule once the design phase is complete and its actually in the process of building its satellites.</p>
<p>Amazon has invested a lot of capital and time into Project Kuiper, with a commitment to back it with an initial $10 billion investment, and a dedicated staff on the project that now includes 500 people, as well as a dedicated office and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/amazon-will-establish-a-new-headquarters-for-its-kuiper-satellite-broadband-project/">research &amp; development facility in Redmond near its global HQ</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will reinstate Parler on its App Store following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">multi-month ban,</a> according to a letter Apple has sent to Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Ken Buck, which was made public this morning via <a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721">a post</a> on Congressman Buck&#8217;s Twitter. TechCrunch also obtained the letter from Apple directly to confirm. The lawmakers had earlier written to Apple on March 31, 2021 to ask for additional information about why the app, which is heavily favored by conservatives, had been removed from the App Store. Apple&#8217;s response explains how Parler violated its policies but said it [Apple] has engaged in extensive conversions with Parler&#8217;s team since the app&#8217;s removal. It also says Parler&#8217;s proposed updates to the app, its content and its moderation practices will allow it to be approved for reinstatement to the App Store immediately update its release.</p>

Huge win for free speech. <a href="https://t.co/FQBDSSSFGk">pic.twitter.com/FQBDSSSFGk</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple was one of several tech platforms that banned Parler following the Capitol riot, after it came to light how the app had been used by Trump supporters and other far-right users<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/"> to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-union-says-140-officers-injured-in-capitol-riot/2021/01/27/60743642-60e2-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html">more than 140 police officers injured</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riot-arrests-2021-04-16/">hundreds of arrests.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon</a> also quickly banned Parler from their respective platforms after the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, the company had first given Parler notice the app would be removed unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan. But Parler&#8217;s then-CEO John Matze posted to his own Parler account that he would not cave to Apple&#8217;s ultimatums and the app, having failed to meet Apple&#8217;s requirements, was banned. In the weeks that followed, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0">Matze was fired</a> by Parler&#8217;s board, controlled by Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer.</p>
<p>Parler has been working to obtain re-entry to the App Store since its removal, but those efforts continued to fall short. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store">Bloomberg reported</a> last month, for example, that Parler had submitted new guidelines in February that were insufficient to comply with the App Store rules due to issues with violating content. That letter, addressed to Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer on February 25, stated: &#8220;There is no place for hateful, racist, discriminatory content on the App Store.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Apple&#8217;s new letter, released today, things have changed. It says that Apple has now informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed moderation practices will qualify it for reinstatement. The letter, signed by Timothy Powderly, Apple&#8217;s senior director of Government Affairs in the Americas, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the period since Apple removed the Parler app from the App Store, Apple’s App Review Team has engaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance with the Guidelines and reinstate it in the App Store. As a result of those conversations, Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices, and the App Review Team has informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstatement to the App Store. Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter also notes that it did not consult with Google or Amazon in respect to its original decision to remove Parler &#8212; a response meant to put to rest the false claims of a coordinated effort between tech giants to silence conservatives.</p>
<p>Apple did not detail what specific changes Parler had agreed to, but earlier this year, the app was still non-compliant with Apple&#8217;s guidelines for allowing user profile pictures that featured swastikas and white nationalist imagery, and because it had permitted usernames and posts that were misogynistic, homophobic and racist, Bloomberg said at the time.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s letter, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html">first reported this morning by CNN</a>, indicates Parler will be approved immediately when submitted.</p>
<p>Apple also told TechCrunch the app&#8217;s relaunch time frame will be up to Parler to decide, but offered no additional comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> has raised a $220 million funding round at a $1.67 billion valuation (€185 million and €1.4 billion respectively). Coatue is leading the round with Dragoneer, Exor, and existing investors Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Temasek also participating.</p>
<p>Alan has been building health insurance products from scratch. When I first covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/alan-wants-to-turn-health-insurance-into-software-as-a-service/">back in 2016</a>, the startup had just managed to get approval from regulators to become an official health insurance company.</p>
<p>Since then, it’s been a not-so-slow and steady growth story as the company now covers 160,000 people. Overall, Alan generates over €100 million in annualized revenue. While most of that revenue is spent back on claims, it’s an impressive revenue trajectory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other insurance companies, Alan has some capital requirements to comply with health insurance regulation. Alan has to raise more if it wants to insure more people. But that’s just part of the story as the startup still had enough cash on its bank account for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>“The context is that we managed to end the year 2020 very strong, finally — and I say finally because it’s been stressful until the last minute,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve told me.</p>
<p>Alan managed to meet its goals and international expansion finally started to take off. Many startups try to raise when they’re in a strong position. You shouldn’t wait until you have your back against the wall and that’s exactly what’s happening here.</p>
<p>“We thought it was the right time and we had multiple term sheets. Even though valuation is really good we first looked at a partner that has a really long-term vision,” Samuelian-Werve said.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company can iterate on its core product — health insurance — and everything that makes Alan a super app — a single app that lets you access several services. In France, employees are covered by both the national healthcare system and private insurance companies. Alan sells its products to other companies so that their employees are automatically covered by Alan contracts. It’s a sort of B2B2C play.</p>
<p>9,400 companies have opted for Alan in France, Belgium and Spain — the company’s home market remains its main market. Clients include WeWork, Deliveroo, JustEat, Vitaliance and Big Mamma. By 2023, Alan wants to reach 1 million members.</p>
<p>In order to gain more customers, Alan is betting on three pillars —&nbsp;product innovation, customer satisfaction through additional services, and expansions to new verticals and markets.</p>
<p>When it comes to product innovation, Alan has designed a modular insurance builder. Small companies can subscribe to Alan in a few clicks. Big companies can tweak every single parameter to build the right insurance package for them.</p>
<p>After that, the company tries to make it easy to manage your health insurance. You’ll soon be able to automatically manage sick leaves, change the employee affiliation status, etc. As for employees, the company has always promoted a transparent offering. For instance, you should know how much you’re going to pay out of pocket when you see a doctor. You can see a map of doctors around you and how much they charge on average. This way, there’s no surprise.</p>
<p>Alan also tries to reimburse you as quickly as possible. If it’s a straightforward claim, the startup tries to analyze and categorize your claim as quickly as possible and then issue an instant SEPA transfer. 75% of claims are reimbursed and available on your bank account in less than an hour.</p>
<p>These core product features definitely contributes to customer satisfaction. But Alan is expanding beyond insurance products with several additional services that should increase retention. For instance, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/health-insurance-startup-alan-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor/">chat with a doctor</a>, get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/health-insurance-startup-alan-launches-free-medical-app-alan-baby/">medical advice for your baby’s health</a>, get a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/health-insurance-startup-alan-covers-meditation-app-subscription/">meditation app subscription</a>, start a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/alan-partners-with-krys-livi-for-telemedicine-appointments/">telehealth appointment</a> via a partner, talk with someone about your mental health, etc.</p>
<p>Those services contribute to turning Alan into a super app for your health. Essentially, as soon as you’re insured by Alan, you become a member and can access all those services without additional charges.</p>
<p>Eventually, Alan plans to launch a personal care guidance service to help you contact the right healthcare professional based on your health issue. In Spain, Alan can already book appointments for you.</p>
<p>Finally, Alan plans to reach new customers through aggressive expansion goals. The company plans to hire 400 people within the next three years and expand to other industries with tailor-made insurance products, such as retail, wholesale and manufacturing.</p>
<p>While the company is still going to focus on France, Belgium and Spain in the near future, it is looking at opportunities across Europe. So let’s see where Alan is going to expand next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase “passive income” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to describe how people can make money by owning rental properties. Many Americans would love to passively earn money, but the process of becoming a landlord can be intimidating and complicated. </span></p>
<p>I mean, how many people have looked back and wished they hadn&#8217;t sold a property after seeing its value rise years after selling it?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those who are already landlords can get overwhelmed by the complexities of managing properties.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup out of Boston, <a href="https://knoxfinancial.com">Knox Financial</a>, aims to help people identify and manage residential rentals with its algorithm-based platform, and it’s raised a $10 million Series A to help it further that goal. Boston-based <a href="https://www.g20vc.com">G20 Ventures</a> led the round, which included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greycroft, Pillar VC, 2LVC, and Gaingels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment brings Knox’s total raised since its inception in 2018 to $14.7 million. The company closed on a $3 million seed round in January 2020, led by Greycroft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox co-founder and CEO David Friedman is no stranger to startups. He founded Boston Logic – an integrated marketing platform and online marketing services for real estate offices and agents – in 2004. He sold that company (now under the name Propertybase) to Providence Equity for an undisclosed amount in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox launched its platform in March of 2019, with the goal of offering homeowners who are ready to move “a completely hands-off way” of converting a home they’re moving out of into an investment property. It also claims to help landlords more easily and efficiently manage their rentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its seed round early last year, the company was only operating in the Boston market and had 50 units on its platform. It’s now operating in seven states, has “hundreds” of investment properties on its platform and is overseeing a portfolio of more than $100 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Once a property is enrolled on Knox’s “Frictionless Ownership Platform,” the company automates and oversees the property’s finances and taxes, insurance, leasing and legal, tenant and property care, banking and bill pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox also has developed a rental pricing and projection model for calculating the investment rate of return a property will produce over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We save investors a lot and almost always make their portfolios more profitable,” Friedman said. “If someone is moving or upsizing, we can turn properties into incredible ROI generators or cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s revenue model is simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a dollar of rent moves through our system, we keep a dime,” Friedman told TechCrunch. “We align our interests with our customers. If there’s no rent coming in, we’re not making money. Or if a tenant doesn&#8217;t pay rent, we don’t make money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox plans to use its new capital to continue expanding geographically and getting the word out to more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to become the de facto platform for real estate investment acquisition and ownership,” Friedman said. “And we have to be coast to coast to really do that for everybody. So, we’re still very early in our growth trajectory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Hower, co-founder and partner of G20 Ventures, shared that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">weeks after his college graduation, he had bought a fixer upper with his mother’s help. A week after finishing renovations, he put the house on the market. Over the subsequent 5 months, he gradually reduced the price as the market softened, and eventually the property sold at a small profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That house now is worth a multiple of what I paid for it,” Hower recalls. “In hindsight, the mistake I made was deciding to sell the house at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience helped Hower appreciate what he describes as a “clarity of thinking” in Knox’s business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Knox existed decades ago, I&#8217;d likely still have that fixer-upper I bought after college,” he said. “Investing platforms such as Betterment have collapsed multiple advising and optimization activities into a simple single-sign-on service, and Knox is the first company to apply this type model to residential real estate investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyltgo wants to make it easier for restaurants and small businesses to compete with same-day delivery services offered by the likes of Amazon and HelloFresh. The Canadian company, which recently raised CAD $2.3 million (USD $1.8 million) in a seed round, is akin to a white label Uber Eats, providing businesses an on-demand delivery platform under their own branding that connects them to gig economy couriers.</p>
<p>“I think about us as a post-purchase experience company,” co-founder and CEO Jaden Pereira told TechCrunch. “The recipient goes directly onto the merchant’s platform and places orders through them, so it feels like they&#8217;re interacting with the brand they purchased from throughout the entire experience. Our messages, notifications, tracking pages and delivery are all customized under the merchant’s brand name, but it’s powered by Tyltgo.”</p>
<p>The necessity of having products delivered during the pandemic&#8217;s shelter-in-place orders combined with the massive reach of e-commerce giants like Amazon has created a society that expects same-day deliveries. Tyltgo recognized the exclusionary nature of that reality on smaller businesses with less time and fewer resources, and contrived to remedy the situation with some innovative tech and gig economy couriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2018, Pereira, 22, co-founded the company with fellow student and developer Aaron Paul while studying at the University of Waterloo. Pereira originally did deliveries himself as a side hustle, while building up a consumer-facing service on Shopify. In October 2019, Pereira and Paul shifted focus to B2B, identifying the real problem as merchants struggling to offer quality same-day delivery at an affordable price.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies CEO Lex Bayer on focus and opportunity in autonomous delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starship-technologies-ceo-lex-bayer-on-focus-and-opportunity-in-autonomous-delivery/embed/#?secret=ja8ucQyyx9" data-secret="ja8ucQyyx9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>From December 2019 to December 2020, Tyltgo’s revenue grew 2000%, says Pereira. The company started 2020 with two staff members and ended with nine, including former head of Uber Eats Canada’s marketplace operations, Joe Rhew, and former director of engineering at Goldman Sachs-acquired fintech company Financeit, Adnan Ali.</p>
<p>Aided by funding from VC firm TI Platform Management, Y Combinator and angel investor Charles Songhurst, Tyltgo projects another 1500% revenue growth for 2021. The company’s goal is to expand its team, develop an API and app-based platform, and add 100 more merchants across Ontario.</p>
<p>Pereira said Tyltgo originally focused on florists, and occasionally pharmacies, but demand from the restaurant industry led to the company’s new target &#8212; meal kit deliveries.</p>
<p>Meal kit services that provide the culinarily challenged with perfectly portioned ingredients and cooking instructions were already gaining popularity in the before times. When the pandemic hit, services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron saw even more growth. As restaurants struggled to keep their businesses open, many started to get in on the action, delivering restaurant-quality meals with instructions for heating and serving.</p>
<p>The global meal kit delivery services market is expected to reach almost $20 billion by 2027, with heat-and-eat options taking a large share of that market. Tyltgo is counting on the success of this industry. It has already secured partnerships with restaurants like General Assembly Pizza and Crafty Ramen, as well as with more traditional meal kit delivery services from grocery stores and organic farms.</p>

<p>Pereira said working in the “quasi-perishable space” of flowers and meal kits is both a challenge and a differentiator for the company. Depending on the contents of the delivery, Tyltgo will determine its perishability window and make sure to match that window with a driver. It’s also got an advanced fleet management platform that assigns a number of deliveries to suit the size of a courier’s vehicle.</p>
<p>“In the earlier days, the hardest part was being able to match those perishability windows without causing damage to the products,” said Pereira. “We all know that in logistics, you have to account for traffic, weather conditions, all these other things, but you have an eight hour delivery window to get out 35 deliveries.”</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring the top quality service Tyltgo advertises while working in the gig economy. Selecting for reliable couriers has slowed the company down at points, but Tyltgo aims to grow capacity only if it can simultaneously maintain a low error threshold.</p>
<p>“We won’t bring on a merchant if we don’t think we have the capacity to handle their deliveries and meet those expectations,” said Pereira.</p>
<p>Whether or not Tyltgo’s meal kit focus will end up driving scalability in the long run, the platform itself has legs. Pereira’s goal is to see Tyltgo become a part of every post-purchase customer experience for all retail trade categories, and that includes expanding into customer service, branding and transactions on top of delivery.</p>
<p>“The main reason why we’re doing this is because a lot of these smaller, brick-and-mortar retailers don’t have the time and resources to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world,” said Pereira. “We want to be able to put that power in their hands.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce is booming as retailers race to transform their brick-and-mortar footprints into online storefronts. By some counts, the market grew an astonishing 42% in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">estimates show that online spending in the U.S. will surpass $1 trillion by 2022</a>. It’s a bonanza, and everyone is figuring out this new terrain.</p>
<p>Consumers are likely familiar with the front-end brands for these storefronts — with companies like Amazon, Shopify, Square, and Stripe owning attention — but it’s the tooling behind the curtain that is increasingly determining the competitiveness of individual stores.</p>
<p><strong>Klaviyo</strong> may not be a household name to consumers (at least, not yet), but in many ways, this startup has become the standard by which email marketers are judged today, triangulating against veterans Mailchimp and Constant Contact and riding the e-commerce wave to new heights.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, this Boston-based company helps marketers personalize and automate their email messaging to customers. By now, most people are intimately familiar with these kinds of emails; if you’ve ever given your email address to an online store, the entreaties to come back to your abandoned cart or browse the latest sale are Klaviyo’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious in retrospect that email would grow to become a premier platform for marketing, but this wasn’t the case even a few years ago when social ads and search engine marketing were the dominant paradigm. Today, owned marketing and customer experience management are white-hot trends, and Klaviyo has surged from a lifestyle business to a multi-billion dollar behemoth in just a few short years. Its story is at the heart of the internet economy today, and the future.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Morrison, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">wrote our EC-1 on Roblox</a>, has been a writer and independent game developer covering the video game industry and the marketing challenges that come with publishing. As an analyst and a potential user, he’s in a unique position to explain the Klaviyo story. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Klaviyo had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Morrison has no financial ties to Klaviyo or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Klaviyo EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,700 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">How Klaviyo transformed from a lifestyle business into a $4.15B email titan</a>&#8221; (2,600 words/10 minutes) — Explores the rise of Klaviyo from a database for e-commerce data into a modern email powerhouse as it successively learned from customers and bootstrapped in the absence of funding from accelerators and early VCs.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Business and growth</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">How Klaviyo used data and no-code to transform owned marketing</a>&#8221; (3,000 words/12 minutes) — Analyzes Klaviyo&#8217;s recent growth and how marketers increasingly focus on owned marketing channels and customer experience management.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Dynamics of e-commerce marketing</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-marketing/">Marketing in 2021 is emotional and not just transactional</a>&#8221; (2,200 words/9 minutes) — To fully understand Klaviyo and this new world of martech, this article contextualizes how and why marketers are increasingly trying to personalize and build deeper emotional bonds with their customers outside of social media channels.</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Lessons on startup growth</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-lessons/">Drama and quirk aren’t necessary for startup success</a>&#8221; (1,900 words/8 minutes) — Founders shouldn&#8217;t have to keep learning the same lessons over and over again. Klaviyo offers a number of tried-and-true tutorials to understand how to build a competitive startup and not get bogged down in finding product-market fit and scaling.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are stories of feverish dreams and obsessive fears. Short of hearing it from the source, a glimpse into the inbox of a founder would be the best way to experience the travails they endure on the way to building a business. A customer finally makes a purchase, a VC invests or walks away, an employee signs their offer letter — all of the major and minor milestones of a startup are communicated via that now-ancient medium of email.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not a part of the initial product.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Email’s ubiquity is only part of the story, though. It’s also a symbol of freedom: The last social platform that remains relatively open and free from the clutches of a single monopoly owner. It’s a market rife with entrenched incumbents, but one that simultaneously continues to invite founders to find some new take on this venerable communications channel and make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>That was the mission that Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen undertook when they founded <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com">Klaviyo</a> back in 2012. What they perhaps didn’t bank on was just how long of a route they were about to take — or how many rejections they might find in their own inboxes from accelerators and VCs who never thought a new generation of email service providers could make it.</p>
<p>So they bootstrapped, kept things lean. They debated canceling dinners to pay the bills when customers churned. And along the way, they built a special startup that is today valued at a whopping $4.15 billion. Klaviyo is the story of how two scrappy, inexperienced entrepreneurs set out to build a lifestyle business — and ended up creating an email titan.</p>
<h2>Racing to the starting line</h2>
<p>Klaviyo’s origin story sounds a bit like the generic advice given by every book on entrepreneurship. Andrew Bialecki — he goes by AB — had a need that no existing company filled. So, he started a company to address that need.</p>
<p>It began with what he calls a side hustle: a website devoted to cataloging the dates and locations of running races. Bialecki had the technical chops to build it, but the data wasn’t already available online and he needed race organizers to provide it. That, in turn, meant he needed to let them know his site existed and constantly follow up to make sure they were using it.</p>
<p>“I realized I&#8217;m on the phone with people and it&#8217;s never going to scale. After a while, I was working on that while I was at another startup, and I said I have two options here. Either I can go all-in on road races, or all-in on the problem: ‘How do we help these businesses connect with the people using their software or products?&#8217;” recalls Bialecki.</p>
<p>By then, he already had a co-founder in mind. Bialecki had been a student together with Ed Hallen at MIT, but the pair actually met while working at Applied Predictive Technologies (APT), a Washington, D.C. tech consultancy.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d read all those books on, hey, when you&#8217;re looking for someone to start a business with, you want someone with similar values who&#8217;s also complementary,” says Bialecki. “I&#8217;d known he was kind of interested in starting a company, and we had really complementary skillsets. I loved the engineering and design and product, and he was a big product guy too, but was used to working with customers and clients.”</p>
<h2>An email company that didn’t (initially) do email</h2>
<p>Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not part of the product that emerged. Instead, Bialecki and Hallen built a database to collect all the e-commerce data that was falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Once we really talked to a lot of e-commerce people, it was clear there were long-standing problems,” says Hallen.</p>
<p>Bialecki adds, “There are facts you know, like their name, their email address, their favorite color or something they told you about their birthday. But some of the harder stuff was, jeez, how many times has this person visited my website, bought something from me, what products did they buy and how is that trending over time? Were they a really frequent customer that dropped off the face of the Earth?”</p>
<p>As they spoke to customers, the founders realized that handling customers&#8217; data and making it useful to them was going to be critical to Klaviyo’s success. It just so happened that gathering data matched well with their experiences working at APT.</p>
<p>“We had a ton of experience stitching together data sources,” says Hallen. “We took that expertise and put it as our foundation. What&#8217;s the most broken, largest market, and let&#8217;s really tie data to it, not as an afterthought.”</p>

<p>What that required, in practical terms, was spending the initial months building a custom database to store the disparate data types that come up during e-commerce transactions — events, documents and object data models. Conor O’Mahony, who joined the company in 2018 as chief product officer and departed this month to become an advisor, says that the company’s early time investment in its database laid the foundations for its later success in scaling up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email is the communication medium that refuses to die.</p>
<p>“Eventually, every technology is trumped by something new and better. And I feel that email is ready to be trumped. But by what?” <a href="https://avc.com/2007/05/what_trumps_ema/">wrote the venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2007</a>. Three years later, <a href="https://avc.com/2010/04/social-networking-vs-email/">he updated readers</a> that other forms of messaging had outgrown email. “It looks like email&#8217;s reign as the king of communication is ending and social networking is now supreme,” he said. (To be fair to Wilson, his view was nuanced enough to continue investing in email tech.)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors weren’t alone — marketers have also spent years anticipating the next big thing.</p>
<p>“It was SMS, it was YouTube, it was Instagram. Before that it was Facebook, then it was Snapchat and TikTok. I kinda feel like individually all those things are fleeting. I think people found: You know what? Everyone still opens their emails every day,” says Darin Hager, a former sneaker entrepreneur who is now an email marketing manager at <a href="https://www.adjustmedia.co/">Adjust Media</a>.</p>
<p>Email has an estimated <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf">four billion users</a> today and continues to grow steadily even as mature social networks plateau. Estimates of the number of nonspam messages sent each day range from <a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep">25 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/">over 300 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a marketing channel with so much volume, there’s voluminous competition to send and program those emails. Yet, despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not using Klaviyo and you&#8217;re in e-commerce, then it&#8217;s not very professional. If you see ‘Sent by Constant Contact or Mailchimp’ at the bottom of an email by a brand, it makes it look like they&#8217;re not really there yet,” Hager said.</p>
<p>How did Klaviyo become the standard solution among email marketers?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">In Klaviyo’s origin story</a>, we delved into part of the answer: The company began life as an e-commerce analytics service. Once it matured to compete as an email service provider, Klaviyo benefited from the edge given by its deeper, more comprehensive focus on data.</p>
<p>However, that leaves several questions unanswered. Why is email so important to e-commerce? What are the substantive differences between Klaviyo’s feature set and those of its competitors? And why did several large, well-funded incumbents fail to capitalize on building an advantage in data first?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll answer those questions — as well as laying out the significance of COVID-19 on the e-commerce market, and how newsletters and AI figure into the company’s future.</p>
<h2>A positive Outlook on email’s longevity</h2>
<p>Email is one of the oldest tech verticals: <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a>, one of the most venerable email service providers (ESPs), was founded in 1995, <a href="https://xconomy.com/boston/2007/10/03/constant-contact-completes-107-million-ipo-shares-up-10-out-of-the-gate/">went public in 2007</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/02/email-marketing-giant-constant-contact-acquired-for-1-billion/">was taken private in 2015 for $1 billion</a>. By the time Klaviyo started in 2012, the space was well served by numerous incumbents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands are emotions made physical. The clothes we wear, the media we consume, the devices we use — all signal not only to others what we value and see in ourselves, they also are a way to construct our very identities. Experimenting to deepen that bond has been at the core of the marketing profession for a century; its origins rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>There had always been one critical limitation, though: Marketers had to appeal to the masses. Radio, television and print media allowed brands to deliver only one message to everyone, no matter if their product conferred luxury or smart cost-consciousness.</p>
<p>On the internet, the masses have been shattered into ever smaller shards, shifting that marketing calculus toward targeted audiences and social network interest groups. Today, niche brands, large corporations and every business in between are reaching ever-narrower audiences.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, advertising and social networks are competitive marketplaces. Over time, prices to reach niche audiences rise, and strategies that once worked become unviable. In 2021, these perpetual challenges are joined by two new factors: a fresh influx of new e-commerce brands and changing privacy policies on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>Klaviyo benefits from these secular trends. While the cost or difficulty of acquiring new customers may increase, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">we looked at in the second part of this EC-1</a>, the cost of emailing an existing one remains much the same. Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors. It’s no longer about marketing to narrow slices of audiences — it&#8217;s about building an emotional bond with an audience of one.</p>
<h2>To a booming economy, now ad inflation</h2>
<p>While 2020 was a banner year for e-commerce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2021 have brought about a new problem: Customer acquisition costs are rising, sometimes to a worrying degree. For instance, one company interviewed by TechCrunch that did not wish to be named said it has seen its return on investment for Facebook ads fall by nearly half in the first months of 2021. Such inflation has also been <a href="https://www.ecimediamanagement.com/eci-inflation-report-q1-2021/">predicted by firms like ECI Media Management</a>.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this increase. First, an unprecedented number of companies are moving online, spurred by COVID-19 and worldwide lockdowns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the stories in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> tell tales of startups in the wilderness hacking out green field opportunities. Klaviyo is a different breed of company: One that went into an established market and challenged powerful incumbents, ultimately finding success with a new, more data-oriented generation of email marketers.</p>
<p>As such, the lessons that it offers are, perhaps, more subtle; its insights bordering on common sense.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, common sense to an uncommon degree becomes wisdom. Here are four pieces of wisdom I’ve gleaned from Klaviyo’s story:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Drama and sizzle help companies stand out, undoubtedly. But are they necessary for success? Klaviyo’s story suggests otherwise.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Drama and quirk aren’t necessary for startup success</h2>
<p>Silicon Valley has become a showcase for oddity. Ironically, we all enjoy &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; (the show) or &#8220;The Social Network<i>.&#8221;</i> Unironically, we toss around phrases like “the hustle” and “sweat equity.” Hot companies often stand out with stories of intense struggle and failure, a larger-than-life founder or a chaotic (and often toxic) management structure.</p>
<p>Drama and sizzle help companies stand out, undoubtedly. But are they necessary for success? Klaviyo’s story suggests otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based ultra-high resolution radar startup Arbe Robotics has a new customer: Chinese autonomous driving company AutoX, which has procured 400,000 Arbe-based radar systems to go in its Level 4 fleet.</p>
<p>The companies said in a statement that Arbe’s platform addresses “core issues” that have been the source of recent AV motor accidents, such as correctly identifying vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians, detecting stationary objects, and removing false alarms caused by ambiguities in the radar image.</p>
<p>It does so using proprietary 2K-resolution, 30 frames per second imaging technology, that the company says is 100 times more detailed than any other radar currently on the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Arbe already has partnerships with five tier one automotive supplier customers, and with chipmaker NVIDIA, CEO Kobi Marenko said in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016440/ea137987ex99-2_industrial.htm">a recent webcast</a>. He further added that the company has two additional purchase orders from an unnamed delivery robot company and from &#8220;one of the largest car companies in the world.”</p>

<p>AutoX, whose backers include Alibaba, Shanghai Motors and MediaTek, has been at the forefront of AV deployment in China. It was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">first company in China</a> to test AVs on public roads without safety drivers, in Shenzhen, one of the country’s largest cities and the location of the company’s headquarters. And it launched a self-driving taxi service, RoboTaxi, in Shanghai.</p>
<p>AutoX was also awarded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/">a permit in California</a> to start driverless testing without a human safety driver, the third company after Waymo and Nuro to have landed such a permit.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced just weeks after Tel Aviv-based Arbe said it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Industrial Tech Acquisitions, at an equity valuation of $722 million. The move was supported by a $100 million PIPE )private investment in public equity) from investors that include M&amp;G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures and Eyal Waldman.</p>
<p>Marenko estimated during the webcast that Arbe’s revenue will only be $7 million in 2021, so investors are clearly bullish on the company’s technology. To that point, Marenko said he expects to exceed $300 million in revenue in 2025 — a 4,185% increase in just four years.</p>

<p>Low-code is quickly becoming commonplace and a popular topic among IT decision-makers. Over the last few years, the market has exploded. Gartner expects it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021">to total $13.8 billion in 2021</a>. That means low-code technology, which we’ve been hearing about for years, is ready for widespread adoption. Today, low-code enables you to streamline (and scale) everything from integration to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It’s a secret only some organizations are clued in on, but it’s a great way to scale fast, save on resources and give your team more time. Here’s how.</p>
<h2>When to use low-code and when to write code</h2>
<p>The best time to use low-code is when you need to add something to your organization that isn’t unique or doesn’t drive significant business value.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer portal is not unique; don’t waste time hand-coding it.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly an extremely helpful feature for our customers, it’s unlikely to drive significant shareholder or investor value. However, it’s key for scaling. Using low-code for a must-have but undifferentiated feature will allow your team to work on more important projects while scaling.</p>
<p>When we started working on the timeline for a customer portal project at HealthBridge, we estimated it would take several sprints per portal to develop, but more pressing development work kept pushing it down the list in our backlog. Waiting a year for a basic feature didn’t seem reasonable to me, so we looked for a workaround.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As online identity management grows in importance, <a href="http://mastercard.com">Mastercard</a> swooped in this morning and bought identity verification company <a href="http://ekata.com">Ekata</a> for $850 million.</p>
<p>Mastercard certainly sees the rapid digital transformation that is happening in online commerce, a move that was accelerated by COVID. It&#8217;s a transformation that once started isn&#8217;t likely to change back to the old ways of doing business, even when we get past the pandemic.</p>
<p>With Ekata, the company gets a solution that can verify the online identity of a person making the transaction in real time using various signals that can indicate if this is fraudulent or true as they open an account or transact business. The company provides a score and other data that predicts the likelihood this person is who they say they are. It&#8217;s not unlike a credit risk score, except for identity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/embed/#?secret=yYxPKcLBzm" data-secret="yYxPKcLBzm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That was one of the primary reasons Mastercard decided to acquire Ekata, according to Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at the company. &#8220;With the addition of Ekata, we will advance our identity capabilities and create a safer, seamless way for consumers to prove who they say they are in the new digital economy,&#8221; Bhalla said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies believe that by combining Mastercard&#8217;s fraud detection solutions with Ekata&#8217;s scoring approach, they will help prevent bad actors from using online platforms to conduct business. &#8220;The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,” Rob Eleveld, CEO at Ekata said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company, which was previously known as White Page Pro, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/06/12/1867525/0/en/Whitepages-Pro-Spins-Off-and-Becomes-Ekata.html#:~:text=Whitepages%20Pro%20will%20change%20its,reach%20%2420%20billion%20in%202022.">was spun out as Ekata</a> in June 2019. It has not raised any additional money, according to both Pitchbook and Crunchbase data. It would seem that $850 million represents a nice exit for a company that hasn&#8217;t raised a dollar, but it&#8217;s clearly more mature than your average startup with 2000 customers including Lyft, Stripe, Equifax, Checkout.com and Intuit.</p>
<p>It appears that Mastercard was willing to pay to get the company it wanted at a time when a solution like this is becoming more essential than ever. The acquisition is subject to standard regulatory approval, but remember regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">quashed the Visa-Plaid</a> deal last year. If it passes muster, it should close some time in the next six months, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis financing company Bespoke Financial today announced it raised $8 million in a Series A financing round. Through this round, the company brought new, key investors into its corner as it fights to bring financing solutions to companies in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Bespoke is a direct lender and provides several financing solutions to companies operating in cannabis. These short-term loans allow the companies to build credit with Bespoke, which then offers better terms on subsequent loans and products. The company says its loan origination volume has grown exponentially, outgrowing forecasts by 25% over the proceeding year. The company has deployed $120 million in gross merchandise volume over 2,000 cannabis license holders with zero defaults to date.</p>
<p>With this new round of capital, Bespoke intends to launch new financing structures and expand its financing options across various distribution channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and Co-founder George Mancheil calls this round a pivotal moment for his company and stamp of validation on the direction and products offered by Bespoke Financial. As he tells TechCrunch, this round provides several key partners to the growing startup.</p>
<p>The financing round was co-led by Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde Capital and Sweat Equity Ventures, along with Ceres Group Holdings, Greenhouse Capital Partners, DoubleLine Capital&#8217;s co-founder and former president Philip Barach, and Robert Stavis, an investor based in New York.</p>
<p>This is Sweat Equity Ventures&#8217; (SEV) first investment into a cannabis company. SEV, backed and funded by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, is led by Dan Portillo and works differently from traditional venture funds. SEV works with founders to provide top engineering and business talent to its portfolio companies. In exchange for these services, SEV takes equity from the companies instead of just writing checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our firm&#8217;s first investment in the cannabis industry, and we are excited to partner with Bespoke as more and more states legalize cannabis use, and the Federal government contemplates nationwide legalization. This partnership combines Bespoke&#8217;s finance and cannabis acumen with our team&#8217;s expertise scaling innovative tech companies, and will provide cannabis companies greater access to streamlined financing while benefiting investors with increased transparency and enhanced risk surveillance,&#8221; says Dan Portillo, Managing Partner of Sweat Equity Ventures, in a released statement.</p>
<p>Karan Wadhera, managing partner at Casa Verde Capital, says Bespoke Financial addresses real needs in a growing industry. Casa Verde Capital previously invested in Bespoke Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/meet-bespoke-financial-a-lender-for-cannabis-companies-backed-by-snoop-doggs-casa-verde-capital/">including in a $7 million round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Bespoke CEO Mancheil tells TechCrunch his company is focused on being more than just a lender; it wants to be a modern financing company that allows it to act as a true partner with the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>With this $8 million in financing, Bespoke Financial has raised $28 million to date. The company was founded in 2019 and, as of this announcement, has 12 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re spent any time on TikTok lately, then you&#8217;ve probably seen a number of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Popl&#8217;s ads</a>. The <a href="https://popl.co/">startup</a> has been successfully leveraging social media to get its modern-day business card alternative in front a wider audience. Packaged as either a phone sticker, keychain or wristband, Popl uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> technology to make sharing contact information as easy as using Apple Pay. To date, Popl has sold somewhere over 700,000 units and has generated $2.7 million in sales for its digital business card technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://popl.co/">Popl</a> co-founder and CEO Jason Alvarez-Cohen, a UCLA grad with a background in computer science, first realized the potential for NFC business cards through a different use case &#8212; a device he encountered in someone&#8217;s home while attending a party. But it sparked the idea to use NFC technology for sharing information person-to-person, which would be faster than alternatives, like AirDrop or manual entry. And so, Popl was born.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139487" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139487" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though startup history is littered with would-be &#8220;business card killers&#8221; that eventually died, what makes Popl different from early contenders is that it combines both an app with a physical product &#8212; the Popl accessory. This accessory can be purchased in a variety of form factors, including the popular Popl phone sticker that you can apply right to the back of your phone case (or even the top of your Popsocket), and customized with a photo of your choosing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, in the past, people would tap phones and share information like that. But I learned quickly that you can&#8217;t do this just phone-to-phone with pure software,&#8221; says Alvarez-Cohen. &#8220;So I was like, what&#8217;s the closest way we can get the phone tapping? And that&#8217;s how I came up with this back-of-the-phone product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each Popl accessory is actually an NFC tag which enables the handoff of the user&#8217;s contact information. When the phones are close, the recipient will get a notification that alerts them to your shared Popl data.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to quickly exchange contact information. You can easily enter in someone&#8217;s digits into your phone&#8217;s contacts app directly, for example, which may work better for more casual encounters &#8212; like meeting someone at a bar. But Popl lets you share a full business cards&#8217; worth of contact data with just a tap, which makes it better for professional encounters, or any other time you want to share more than just your phone number.</p>
<p>While the Popl tags make for a nice gimmick, the Popl mobile app is what makes the overall service useful. And to be clear, the app is <em>only</em> necessary for the Popl&#8217;s owner &#8212; the recipient doesn&#8217;t need the app installed for Popl to work. They will, however, need to have a phone that <a href="https://www.bluebite.com/nfc/iphone-nfc-compatibility">can read NFC tags</a>, which can leave out some older devices. Or, as a backup, they&#8217;ll need ability to scan the QR code the app provides as a workaround.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png 3375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=2048,1646 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p>
<p>In the Popl app, you can customize which data you want to share with others &#8212; including your contact info, social profiles, website links, etc. &#8212; all via an easy-to-use interface. Like some business card apps in the past, you can flip in between a personal profile and a business profile in Popl in order to share the appropriate information when out networking. To actually make the exchange of contact information with another person, you simply hold up your phone to theirs and they&#8217;ll get a notification directing them to your Popl profile webpage. (The phones don&#8217;t have to physically touch or bump together, however. It&#8217;s more like Apple Pay, where they have to be near each other.)</p>
<p>From the Popl website that&#8217;s shared via the notification that pops up, the recipient can tap on the various options to connect with the sender &#8212; for example, adding them on a social network like LinkedIn or Instagram, grabbing their phone number to send a quick text, or even downloading a full contact card to their phone&#8217;s address book, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139500" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139500" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png 3375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=2048,1646 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p>
<p>The app&#8217;s more clever feature, however, is something Popl calls &#8220;Direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>This patented feature won&#8217;t send over the Popl website where the recipient then has to choose how they want to connect. Instead, it opens up the destination app directly. For example, if you have LinkedIn Direct on, the recipient will be taken directly to your profile on LinkedIn when they tap the notification. Or if you put your Contact Card on Direct, it will just pop your address book entry onto the screen so the user can choose to save it to their phone.</p>
<p>For paid users, the app also lets you track your history of Popl connections on a map, so you can recall who you met, where and when, along with other analytics.</p>

<p>Work on Popl, which is co-founded by Alvarez-Cohen&#8217;s UCLA roommate, Nick Eischens, now Popl COO, began in late 2019. The startup then launched in February 2020 &#8212; just before the coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S. That could have been a disastrous time for a business designed to help people exchange information during in-person meetings when the world was now shifting to Zoom and remote work. But Alvarez-Cohen says they marketed Popl as a &#8220;contactless solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have this, and I have to meet someone for my business, I don&#8217;t even have to tap it &#8212;  you can just hover, and it will still send that information,&#8221; Alvarez-Cohen says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m able to share my business card with you without handing you a business card, which is kind of safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what really helped to sell Popl were its video demos. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">One TikTok ad</a>, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen if you use TikTok at all, features the co-founders&#8217; friend <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@endicci">Arev</a> sharing her TikTok profile with a new friend just as she&#8217;s leaving the gym.</p>
<p>In the video, the recipient &#8212; clearly dumbfounded by the technology after she taps his phone &#8212; responds <em>&#8220;what? what? Whoa! What? How&#8217;d you do that?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now been viewed over 80 million times.</p>

</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl">Popl&#8217;s TikTok videos</a> get high tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and sometimes still millions of views per video. The company also has an active presence on other social media. For instance, Popl posts regularly to Instagram where it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/popl/">over 100K followers</a>. Today, the startup&#8217;s growth now is about 60% driven by Facebook and Instagram marketing and 40% organic, Alvarez-Cohen says.</p>
<p>Now, the company is preparing new products for the post-pandemic era when in-person events return. Though it had before sold <a href="https://popl.co/pages/enterprise">Popl&#8217;s in bulk</a> for this purpose, it&#8217;s now readying an &#8220;event bracelet&#8221; that just slips on your wrist (and is reusable). The bracelet could be used at any big event &#8212; like music festivals or business conferences, where you&#8217;re meeting a lot of new people. And because Popl uses NFC, phones have to be close to make the contact info exchange &#8212; it won&#8217;t just randomly share your info with everyone you pass by them.</p>
<p>Popl is also fleshing out the business networking side of its app with integrations for Salesforce, Oracle and Hubspot, and CSV export, that come with its <a href="https://popl.co/pages/pro">Popl Pro subscription</a> ($4.99 per month). The in-app subscription is already at $320,000 in annual recurring revenue and growing 10% every week, as of early April.</p>
<p>A Y Combinator Winter 2021 participant, Popl is backed by Twitch co-founder Justin Kan (via Goat Capital), YC, Urban Innovation Fund, Cathexis Ventures, and others angels including Wish.com CEO Peter Szulczewski and Plangrid co-founder Ralph Gootee.</p>
<p>The app is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/popl/id1503939262">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfc.popl">Android</a>, and the Popl accessories are sold on its <a href="https://popl.co/">website</a> and on <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=popl">Target.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has intervened to trigger public interest scrutiny of chipmaker&#8217;s Nvidia&#8217;s planned to buy Arm Holdings.</p>
<p>The secretary of state for digital issues, Oliver Dowden, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-secretary-instructs-cma-to-look-into-nvidias-takeover-of-arm">said today</a> that the government wants to ensure that any national security implications of the semiconductor deal are explored.</p>
<p>Nvidia&#8217;s $40BN acquisition of UK-based Arm was announced last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">September</a> but remains to be cleared by regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began to solicit views on the proposed deal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/uks-markets-regulator-asks-for-views-on-nvidia-arm/">January</a>.</p>
<p>Domestic opposition to Nvidia&#8217;s plan has been swift, with one of the original Arm co-founders kicking off a campaign to &#8216;save Arm&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-starts-save-arm-campaign-to-keep-independence-amid-40b-nvidia-deal/">last year</a>. Hermann Hauser warned that Arm&#8217;s acquisition by a U.S. entity would end its position as a company independent of U.S. interests &#8212; risking the U.K.&#8217;s economic sovereignty by surrendering its most powerful trade weapon.</p>
<p>The intervention by Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; using statutory powers set out in the Enterprise Act 2002 &#8212; means the competition regulator has been instructed to begin a phase 1 investigation.</p>
<p>The CMA has a deadline of July 30 to submit its report to the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Dowden said: “Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of ARM, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds. As a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At the completion of the CMA&#8217;s phase 1 investigation Dowden will have an option to clear the deal, i.e. if no national security or competition concerns have been identified; or to clear it with remedies to address any identified concerns.</p>
<p>He could also refer the transaction for further scrutiny by instructing the CMA to carry out an in-depth phase 2 investigation.</p>
<p>After the phase 1 report has been submitted there is no set period when the secretary of state must make a decision on next steps &#8212; but DCMS notes that a decision should be made as soon as &#8220;reasonably practicable&#8221; to reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>While Dowden&#8217;s intervention has been made on national security grounds, additional concerns have been raised about impact of an Nvidia take-over of Arm &#8212; specifically on U.K. jobs and on Arm&#8217;s open licensing model.</p>
<p>Nvidia sought to address those concerns last year, claiming it&#8217;s committed to Arm&#8217;s licensing model and pledging to expand the Cambridge, UK offices of Arm &#8212; saying it would create &#8220;a new global center of excellence in AI research&#8221; at the UK campus.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s hard to see what commercial concessions could be offered to assuage concern over the ramifications of an Nvidia-owed Arm on the UK&#8217;s economic sovereignty. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a political risk, which would require a political solution to allay, such as at a treaty level &#8212; something which isn&#8217;t in Nvidia&#8217;s gift (alone) to give.</p>
<p>National security concerns are a rising operational risk for tech companies involved in the supply of cutting edge infrastructure, such as semiconductor design and next-gen networks &#8212; where a relative paucity of competitors not only limits market choice but amps up the political calculations.</p>
<p>Proposed mergers are one key flash point as market consolidation takes on an acute politico-economic dimension.</p>
<p>However tech companies&#8217; operations are being more widely squeezed in the name of national security &#8212; such as, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/trump-huawei-zte-ban-tech/">in recent years</a>, the U.S. government&#8217;s attacks on China-based 5G infrastructure suppliers like Huawei, with former president Trump seeking to have the company barred from supplying next-gen networks not only within the U.S. but to national networks of Western allies.</p>
<p>Nor has (geo)political pressure been applied purely over key infrastructure companies in recent years; with Trump claiming a national security justification to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/trump-says-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-wont-be-extended/">try and shake down the Chinese-owned social networking company, TikTok</a> &#8212; in another example that speaks to how tech tools are being coopted into wider geopolitical power-plays, fuelled by countries&#8217; economic and political self-interest.</p>

<p>Hi there, new and returning readers. This is The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting ready to ship this newsletter, I spotted that there was a fatal crash involving a Tesla, in which no one was in the driver&#8217;s seat. There was an individual in the passenger seat and one in the rear. Both men died. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Follow </span><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2Deven">@KPRC2Deven</a>, the Houston reporter who <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">broke this story over the weekend, to keep up with the latest.

<p>Welp. I was only partially right about the e-scooter pilot in New York City. On Wednesday, <strong>Lime</strong> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">as I predicted</a>), <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Veo</strong> were officially chosen to kick off the city&#8217;s first foray into the world of shared electric scooters. Equity, accessibility and proven capabilities of keeping those pesky vehicles off of sidewalks were top priorities for the NYC Department of Transportation. Each company will be releasing 1,000 e-scooters into parts of the east Bronx, with more to come in the second phase expanding further into the borough.</p>
<p>The process of gaining this small sliver of the Big Apple has been very competitive. City concessions are a hot commodity, and winning New York is perceived to be, in technical terms, a big deal. The operators that hit the mean streets of New York have the potential to survive as the rideshare industry continues to consolidate under two-wheeled micromobility giants. But there is something a little bit anticlimactic about the news. Not to knock the Bronx, but dockless e-scooters are needed and could be of use citywide. One has to wonder how much influence Lyft-owned Citi Bike has over where e-scooter companies get to operate.</p>
<p>The 2018 legislation that allowed for the e-scooter pilot in the first place very clearly stipulates that pilot zones would be prioritized based, in large part, on areas of the city that don&#8217;t have access to docked bike shares, which basically means areas that don&#8217;t have access to Citi Bike. And the pilot zone in the Bronx doesn&#8217;t extend into areas in the South Bronx where Citi Bike plans to expand. I guess we&#8217;ll see how it goes after the first year.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about Europe</h2>
<p>Electric bikes and scooters are barely legal in Ireland, but <strong>Tier</strong> is already <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/dcu-rolls-out-e-scooter-scheme-on-its-campuses-1.4537439">preparing for more regulation</a>. The Berlin-based e-scooter company has partnered with the Irish micromobility tech platform Luna, the Insight SFO Centre for Data Analytics, and Smart DCU to create a new AI-powered e-scooter trial that&#8217;ll launch on Dublin City University campuses as soon as the ink on the bill legalizing e-scooters dries.</p>
<p>The fleet of 30 computer vision-enabled scooters will allow Insight researchers to analyze a new, ever-growing dataset. Luna&#8217;s tech will allow the scooters to roll out with pedestrian and lane identification, making them as safe as the Irish government could possibly hope for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in France, the government is moving closer to being the first country in the world to offer people the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trading-clunkers-electric-bikes-france-moves-offer-financial-incentive-2021-04-11/">chance to trade in clunkers</a> for an electric or folding bicycle. Owners that scrap their yucky old ICE cars can get a €2,500 rebate to buy a bike with the money. The National Assembly just approved the measure in a preliminary vote.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, I know we had Grab as deal of the week in the last edition of The Station, but now we have a finalized deal and it&#8217;s a lot bigger than expected.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing, delivery and super app&#8221; company Grab finally and officially <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">announced</a> plans to go public. Grab, which operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, merged with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter Growth Corp. The merger would value Grab at $39.6 billion and the company would keep $4.5 billion in cash. Importantly, Altimeter agreed to a three-year lockup period for its sponsor shares.</p>
<p>Grab has aspirations for the capital that the public markets provide. The company thinks there’s still a lot of room to grow when it comes to food delivery and on-demand mobility in Southeast Asia. It expects to see the total addressable market jump from $52 billion to $180 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>As part of the announcement, Grab shared some metrics and some big numbers. In 2020, the company managed to generate around $12.5 billion in gross merchandise value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Battery Resourcers</strong>, a startup that has a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; process to turn recycled battery material into nickel-manganese-cobalt cathodes to sell back to battery manufacturers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">raised</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in a $20 million Series B equity round led by Orbia Ventures, with injections from At One Ventures, TDK Ventures, TRUMPF Venture, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures and InMotion Ventures. Battery Resourcers CEO Mike O&#8217;Kronley declined to disclose the company&#8217;s new valuation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company aiming to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco and Dubai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/walmart-helps-push-cruises-latest-investment-round-to-2-75b/">added Walmart as an investor</a> in an extended fundraising round that has grown to $2.75 billion. The company said it has a post-money valuation of more than $30 billion. Walmart and several unnamed institutional investors added capital to a $2 billion equity round announced back in January that was led by Microsoft.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-0"><strong>Clearcover</strong>, the digital car insurance startup, raised $200 million as part of a late-stage financing round led by Eldridge, the investment firm helmed by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-insurance-startup-clearcover-raises-200-mln-eldridge-others-1-bln-2021-04-13/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dat Bike</strong>, a Vietnamese startup with ambitions to become the top electric motorbike company in Southeast Asia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/vietnamese-electric-motorbike-startup-dat-bike-raises-2-6m-led-by-jungle-ventures/">raised $2.6 million in pre-Series A funding</a> led by Jungle Ventures. Dat Bike&#8217;s selling point is its ability to compete with gas motorbikes in terms of pricing and performance. Its new funding is the first time Jungle Ventures has invested in the mobility sector, and included participation from Wavemaker Partners, Hustle Fund and iSeed Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Oxbotica</strong>, a U.K. startup that develops autonomous driving systems took on online grocer Ocado as a new investor. Ocado, which took a $13.8 million stake in the AV startup, is treating this as a strategic investment to develop AI-powered, self-driving systems that will work across its operations, from vehicles within and around its packing warehouses through to the last-mile vehicles that deliver grocery orders to people&#8217;s homes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/oxbotica-raises-13-8m-from-ocado-to-build-autonomous-vehicle-tech-for-the-online-grocers-logistics-network/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong>, Volvo Car Group&#8217;s standalone electric performance brand, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/polestar-raises-500m-from-outside-investors-as-ev-market-grows/">raised $550 million</a> in its first external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> debuted on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001823593/000119312521108212/d909743ds1a.htm">public market this week</a>. The company raised a bit more than $1 billion in its IPO, selling shares at $40. I interviewed the CEO Cheng Lu, so keep an eye out for that article in the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Xwing</strong> scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/autonomous-aviation-startup-xwing-hits-400m-valuation-after-latest-funding-round/">raised $40 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>
<h2>Scale AI&#8217;s Alexandr Wang</h2>

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong>, the data labeling startup that essentially<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> sells the picks and shovels needed to develop and apply artificial intelligence, closed a $155 million round  back in December. Just after that round closed, more investors came calling co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang told me in a recent interview. </span></p>
<p>The upshot? A $325 million Series E funding round co-led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global at a valuation of more than $7 billion — double what it was four months ago. Additional new investors Wellington Management and Durable Capital joined existing investors Coatue, Index, Founders Fund and YC. Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon&#8217;s Worldwide Consumer business, will be joining as advisor to Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors, I think are really ready to go all in on AI and you&#8217;re seeing that just across the board in terms of investments,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;A lot of that is because, I think AI as an industry is really going from something that&#8217;s been more research based and theoretical to one that&#8217;s really rooted in impact and real business results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang said the company, which got its start serving the autonomous vehicle industry, is seeing an increase in demand for its product from a broad swath of industries, including the government. Its customers now include fintech companies like Brex, PayPal and Square, e-commerce businesses Etsy, Instacart and Pinterest, transportation and logistics companies Flexport, GM, Luminar, Oshkosh as well government agencies such as the Department of Defense and U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>Wang said they&#8217;ve also noticed this &#8220;incredible pickup&#8221; from its customers to view Scale AI as a full stack infrastructure provider and a full stack AI partner, rather than just a data lake provider. &#8220;That&#8217;s been another big evolution that is that a lot of our investors are really excited about.</p>
<p>And finally, I asked Wang if we should expect an IPO or another fundraising round soon. He didn&#8217;t quite answer my question. But here&#8217;s what he did say:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our goal is to build a super sustainable business where we don&#8217;t need to keep raising outside capital and so our intent is certainly not to not to have to keep raising money to operate the business, and in fact I think historically we&#8217;ve always operated really efficiently,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;I think the idea is that we as a business, we don&#8217;t really need to keep raising outside capital, beyond this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hey there! TechCrunch reporter <strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> loves some good wonky policy. And so periodically — like today! — she will bring us transportation-related policy updates.</p>
<p>EV manufacturers have been waging legislative battles in multiple states over the ability to sell directly to customers, rather than at established franchise dealerships. It&#8217;s a privilege that&#8217;s been held to this point only by Tesla, and even then only in select states. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/">TechCrunch covered the issue a few weeks ago</a>.) But there are signs that the fight may be turning into something larger.</p>
<p>A senior representative from one of the country&#8217;s largest automaker lobbying groups, Alliance for Automaker Innovation &#8212; which has until this point been fighting EV makers&#8217; push to direct sell, in step with dealership groups &#8212; made a major pivot from this stance. Alliance&#8217;s Wayne Weikel told Vermont lawmakers during a hearing of one of the state&#8217;s legislative committees that it is Alliance&#8217;s position in Vermont that the state should consider allowing automakers to sell directly to customers &#8212; all automakers.</p>
<p>This is a major break from the group&#8217;s established position, which is defending dealers&#8217; monopoly on selling cars in every other state where direct sales legislation is being considered. It&#8217;s unclear why the group has broken ranks in Vermont only, or if they&#8217;ll be doing so in any other state.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that things will be changing anytime soon, and certainly not in all fifty states. The direct sales bills in Washington and Georgia were both killed this legislative session, for example. A source close to the issue noted to TechCrunch that Washington&#8217;s Rep. Amy Walen (D), the Vice Chair of the House Consumer Protection and Business Committee (which heard the bill), is herself an auto dealer &#8212; the owner of Hyundai of Kirkland. The same is true of a legislator in Idaho, Rep. Jim Addis, who is part of a committee hearing the direct sales bill in that state.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>— Aria Alamalhodaei</em></p>
<p><strong>Oh and one more thing, from TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Remember the bill that California state Senator Dave Min introduced<span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">require all AVs in the state</a> to be zero-emission by 2025? Well, the bill has cleared the California Senate Transportation Committee. The language has been reworked a bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the bill would require all light-duty autonomous vehicles to be zero emission by 2027. The previous language hadn’t stipulated a type of self-driving vehicle, which could have had massive consequences on industries planning on heavy-duty AVs like autonomous trucking. While the bill still has a ways to go before it’s on Governor Newsom’s desk, it’s in line with the state’s goals to reduce emissions.</span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> will be releasing its Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment — the official jargon in government speak for what can be described as its safety report — on Monday. But here at The Station, you <a href="https://www.argo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArgoSafetyReport.pdf">can see it first</a>. I haven&#8217;t done a super close read yet, but check out page 30 for the description on perception and a few pages later, how their self-driving system handles ambiguous situations.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Cruise</strong> announced it struck a deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/cruise-strikes-deal-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dubai/">launch a robotaxi service in Dubai</a> in 2023. This announcement felt like a distraction and has me wondering when Cruise is going to make — and show — technical progress with its autonomous vehicle deployment efforts in San Francisco, the market it has been aiming for all these years. Cruise said the robotaxi service in Dubai will use the Cruise Origin, the all-electric shuttle-like vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> subsidiary <strong>Mobileye</strong> struck a deal with Udelv to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ntels-mobileye-teams-with-udelv-to-launch-35000-driverless-delivery-vehicles-by-2028/">supply its self-driving system</a> to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles, dubbed Transporters, on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023. It&#8217;s worth noting that Udelv was once developing its own self-driving system, but has now ditched that in favor of Mobileye&#8217;s SDS.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery vehicle company, will soon be delivering Domino’s pizza in parts of Houston. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">Please welcome your new pizza overlords</a>.) On certain days and times, customers who prepay online can choose to have the bot R2 drop their pizzas off. They’ll receive a text when the robot is outside and will be given an access code to open the bot’s chamber and release hot cheesy goodness into their hands.</span></p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup that recently raised $310 million, received a permit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-weride-scores-permit-to-test-driverless-cars-in-san-jose/">test driverless vehicles</a> (meaning without a human safety driver behind the wheel) on public roads in San Jose, California. WeRide is the seventh company, following AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro Waymo and Zoox, to receive a driverless testing permit. The permit only allows for two driverless vehicles.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> and LG Chem announced plans to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/gms-second-2-3b-battery-plant-with-lg-chem-to-open-in-late-2023/">second U.S. battery cell factory</a> &#8212; a $2.3 billion facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee that will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade.</p>
<p><strong>QuantumScape</strong>, the solid state battery company, filed a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-119470/">document with the SEC</a> that caught my attention. Celina Mikolajczak has joined its board. Why does that matter? Mikolajczak is the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Vice President of Engineering and Battery Technology at Panasonic Energy of North America and prior to that was senior manager, cell quality and materials engineering at Tesla.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to bring an electric pickup to market later this year, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ev-automaker-rivian-partners-with-samsung-sdi-in-battery-cell-supply-deal/">partnered with Samsung SDI</a> as its battery cell supplier. The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI &#8220;throughout the vehicle development process.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tesla&#8217;s</strong> lawsuit against Dr. Guangzhi Cao is over. For the unfamiliar, Tesla had accused Cao, a former employee, of stealing source code from its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system and sharing it with XMotors, the U.S. unit of Chinese EV maker Xpeng, where he had taken a new job. A U.S. district court filing dated April 15 said the matter had been settled. Cao no longer works at XMotors.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement from XMotors, which was never made a party to the lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote><p>After over two years of extensive discovery, including against XMotors, Tesla has failed to find any substantive evidence that supports its allegations and innuendos against XMotors. Tesla has failed to show any credible evidence that XMotors ever possessed, let alone used, any Tesla information from Dr. Cao.</p>
<p>Tesla has finally dismissed its claims and stopped its search for evidence that does not exist.</p>
<p>Technology innovation is at core of our foundation and strategy. In our pursuit of popularizing smart EVs, we respect any competition; however, we will not tolerate any bullying behavior or attempt to disrupt competitors. XMotors fully respects intellectual property rights, and bases its own competitive edge on its in-house-developed proprietary R&amp;D and intellectual property.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TezLab</strong>, a free app that’s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/tesla-owners-can-now-see-how-much-solar-or-coal-is-powering-their-evs/">pushed out a new feature</a> this week that shows the energy mix — breaking down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy — coming from charging locations, including Superchargers and third-party networks throughout the United States.</p>
<h3>Evtols</h3>
<p><strong>NFT Inc.</strong>, a relatively unknown drive-and-fly vehicle startup, is betting it will succeed where its rivals have failed, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/nft-inc-reimagines-urban-and-rural-living-with-flying-car-aska/">preorders opening for ASKA</a>, its first electric flying car. The SUV-sized ASKA ( which means &#8220;flying bird&#8221; in Japanese) may be better described as a plane that drives, rather than a car that flies. Even when its six rotors are folded closed, the vehicle has the unmistakable look of a flying craft, with a helicopter-esque bubble front window and a distinct tail that would be familiar to anyone who has flown on an airplane. Important note: ASKA isn&#8217;t anticipated to be delivered until 2026.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Apex.AI</strong>, a startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, has spent four years rewriting the robot operating system that will give automakers the tools to integrate software within the vehicle and make sure all the applications run reliably. Now, freshly armed with a safety certification that validates its software development kit (SDK) is sophisticated enough to be used in production vehicles, Apex.AI has landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/toyota-taps-apex-ai-for-its-autonomous-vehicle-operating-system/">Toyota and Japanese tech startup Tier IV as partners</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</strong> executives warned that the global semiconductor shortage, which has produced production slowdowns at Ford and General Motors, may drag on into 2022. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei pointed to the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as &#8220;geopolitical tensions&#8221; as reasons for the prolonged shortage in an investor call. TSMC, one of the world&#8217;s largest chip manufacturers, supplies chips for a wide range of products including smartphones, high-performing computers, and Internet of Things. Automotive sales accounted for 4% of their first-quarter revenue, which may not seem like much &#8212; but that&#8217;s a 31% increase quarter-over-quarter. (Aria Alamaldohaei)</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> will debut its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">new hands-free driving feature</a> (nope this doesn&#8217;t belong in the AV section) on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. The automaker is aiming to compete with similar systems from Tesla and GM.</p>
<p>That hands-free capability uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> lifted the final veil on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">flagship EQS sedan</a> after weeks of teasers, announcements and even a pre-production drive in which TechCrunch participated. (The company also released a 62-page press release alongside the reveal). There is a ton of the tech crammed into this vehicle from the microsleep warning system and 56-inch hyperscreen to the monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. Oh, and 350 sensors used to record distances, speeds and accelerations, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver&#8217;s blink of an eye or the passengers&#8217; speech.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> appears to have lost another legal battle in Europe. Labor activists challenging Uber over what they allege are &#8216;robo-firings&#8217; of drivers in Europe have trumpeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">winning a default judgement</a> in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam ordered the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221; The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>
<p>In other Uber-related news &#8230; Uber&#8217;s transit SaaS program is expanding in partnership with three new agencies in Denver, Cecil County, Maryland and Porterville, California. Uber Transit already has deals with Marin Transit in California and Cape May County in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event, which is scheduled for June 9,  will be virtual again — as I mentioned last week. I&#8217;ll provide updates each week as we announce speakers.</p>
<p>This week, I want to point your attention to a panel I put together that will focus on mobility, profitability and equity. Here are the questions we hope to address: can mobility be accessible, equitable and profitable? And how?</p>
<p>We are bringing together three guests who are at the center of cities, equity and shared mobility to help us answer those questions — community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true">Early Bird tickets</a> to the show are now available — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book today</a> and save $100 before prices go up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Other guests to TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, includes <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose SPAC merged with Joby, investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, as well as <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO/CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/61f51db4-eafc-45e9-a2f1-6016dcb358e0?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">news roundup from last week</a> was probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a few months, so make sure to catch up on that if you haven&#8217;t. That said, here&#8217;s a rundown of what we got into on the show this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">new Clubhouse round</a> has us thinking about what is a good venture-style bet, and what isn&#8217;t. At least you can&#8217;t fault the Clubhouse crew for not having conviction.</li>
<li>UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">as expected</a>.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an Apple event this week, which caused us to wonder why more startups aren&#8217;t competing with the giant.</li>
<li>Cryptos have recovered from the flash crash, which had us thinking.</li>
<li>Druva raised $147 million as TechCrunch will report later today, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">Razorpay raised even more capital</a> at a newly refreshed valuation.</li>
<li>Finally, DoNotPay had some news, but it&#8217;s corporate ethos proved even more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The week is here, everyone! It&#8217;s Monday! We can do this!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook today announced a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/transfer-your-facebook-posts-and-notes-with-our-expanded-data-portability-tool/">announced</a> a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services. Although the company has long since offered tools that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/facebook-now-allows-you-to-download-your-information/">let you download the information</a> you&#8217;ve posted to Facebook, the tool launching today offers a more practical way of saving that data &#8212; by allowing you to export your notes and posts to popular services like Google Docs, Blogger, or WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Facebook users will find this latest feature under the &#8220;Your Facebook Information&#8221; menu in Settings, where you&#8217;ll then click &#8220;Transfer Your Information.&#8221; A series of prompts will walk you through the process to transfer you data to the one of the available destinations.</p>
<p>To protect the data, Facebook says it will ask users to re-enter their password before the transfer begins, which it also does with other exports. The process will encrypt the data as it moves between Facebook and the other service, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move to support the export of text-based content is interesting, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html">it&#8217;s been reported</a> Facebook is developing a competitor to newsletter platform Substack. The social network aims to capitalize on the growing momentum in the newsletter industry, which has recently seen a number of top writers leave larger publications in order to connect with their audience directly, via paid newsletters. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">also acquired a newsletter business, Revue</a>, to pursue the same goals. While Facebook didn&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s upcoming product would be included in the export procedure announced today, it makes for a good hedge against any sort of anti-competitive claims if and when Facebook rolls out the new service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s addition is part of Facebook&#8217;s larger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/data-transfer-project/">Data Transfer Project</a>, a collaboration between tech giants designed to give users more ways to move their content between services. Last year, for example, Facebook added a feature that gave users a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/facebook-now-allows-users-in-the-u-s-canada-to-export-photos-and-videos-to-google-photos/">export their Facebook photos and videos to Google Photos</a>, as a result of the team-up. Users can now also export photos and videos to Backblaze, Dropbox, and Koofr, as well.</p>
<p>Alongside news of its announcement, Facebook argued for regulation in the area of data portability. It said there should be laws that determine which data should be made portable, and who is responsible for protecting the data once it has been transferred. The company also pointed to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/comments-on-data-portability/">comments it filed with the FTC</a> last year as well as <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-and-data-portability/">a white paper</a> that explored the privacy questions that surround the development of data portability tools.</p>
