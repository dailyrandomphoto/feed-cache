										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">survey</a> European founders and investors in cities outside the larger European capitals.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will ask entrepreneurs in these cities to talk about their ecosystems, in their own words.</p>
<p><strong>This is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put <strong>Belfast</strong> on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>If you are a tech startup founder or investor in the city please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out the survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for Extra Crunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19 and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has launched a new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/find-my-certification-asst/id1532296125">Find My Certification Asst.</a>, designed for use by MFi (Made for iPhone) Licensees, who need to test their accessories&#8217; interoperability with Apple&#8217;s Find My network. The network helps users find lost Apple devices &#8212; like iPhones, AirPods and Mac computers, among other things &#8212; but is poised to add support for finding other compatible accessories manufactured by third parties.</p>
<p>The launch of the testing app signals that Apple may be ready to announce the launch of the third-party device program in the near future.</p>
<p>According to the app&#8217;s description, MFi Licensees can use Find My Certification Asst. to test the &#8220;discovery, connection and other key requirements&#8221; for their accessories that will incorporate Apple&#8217;s Find My network technology. It also points to information about the Find My network certification program on Apple&#8217;s MFi Portal at <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">mfi.apple.com</a>, which currently references Find My network as a MFi program technology that&#8217;s &#8220;launching soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new app&#8217;s screenshots indicate it allows device makers to run a wide variety of tests in areas like connectivity, sound (for example, if the item can make a noise when misplaced), firmware, key management, NFC, power and more.</p>

<p>The app became publicly available on Sunday, April 4 on the iOS App Store, according to Sensor Tower data. It&#8217;s brand new so is not yet ranking in any App Store categories, including its own, &#8220;Developer Tools,&#8221; or others. It also has no ratings and reviews at this time.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s launch is step toward the larger goal of opening up the Apple Find My network to third parties and Apple&#8217;s planned launch of its own new accessory, AirTags.</p>
<p>Apple at last year&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking">had first announced</a> it would open up Find My to third-party devices after facing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">pressure from regulators</a> in the U.S. and Europe who had been looking into, among other things, whether Apple had been planning to give itself an advantage with its forthcoming launch of AirTags, a competitor to Tile&#8217;s lost-item finder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134629" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134629" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134629" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-10.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134629" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of FMCA app</p></div></p>
<p>A prominent Apple critic, Tile had complained that AirTags would be able to connect with Apple&#8217;s U1 chips, which use UWB (ultra-wideband) technology for more precise finding capabilities, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/sonos-popsockets-complain-to-congress-about-big-tech.html">at a Congressional hearing noted</a> that AirTags would work with Apple&#8217;s own Find My app, which ships by default on Apple devices. This, Tile believed, would give Apple a first-party advantage in the lost-item finder market that Tile had successfully established and dominated for years.</p>
<p>Apple, in response, opened up <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework">third-party developer access</a> to its U1 chip via its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction">&#8220;NearbyInteraction&#8221;</a> framework last year. As a result, Tile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">in Jan. 2021 announced</a> its plan to launch a new tracker powered by UWB.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-enables-new-items-tab-in-find-my-to-track-airtags-and-third-party-accessories/">Apple updated its Find My app</a> to include a new tab called &#8220;Items&#8221; in preparation for the app&#8217;s expanded support for AirTags and other third-party accessories, like those from Tile and others. This &#8220;Items&#8221; tab is enabled in latest Apple&#8217;s iOS 14.5 beta release, where the app explains how the Find My app will now be able to help users keep track of their everyday items &#8212; including accessories and other items that are compatible with Find My.</p>
<p>However, Tile (and likely others) feel that Apple&#8217;s concessions still disadvantage their businesses because participation in Apple&#8217;s FindMy program means that the third-party device maker would have to abandon its existing app and instead require its customers to use Apple&#8217;s FindMy app &#8212; effectively turning over its customers and their data to Apple.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that, upon launch, the app features an icon that shows three items: headphones, a backpack and a suitcase. Not coincidentally, perhaps, Tile&#8217;s first integrations were with Bose headphones and luggage and bag makers, Away and Herschel.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded to a request for comment about the new app&#8217;s launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries in a small and growing market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don&#8217;t produce tailpipe emissions, they&#8217;re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs. But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the average electric vehicle lithium-ion battery can retain up to 70% of its charging capacity after being removed. The business proposition for second-life batteries is therefore intuitive: Before sending the battery to a recycler, automakers can potentially generate additional revenue by putting it to use in another application or selling it to a third party.</p>
<p>Low consumer uptake and the relatively recent introduction of EVs to the market has kept the supply of used batteries low, but automakers are already pursuing a number of second-life projects.</p>
<p>To name only a few such projects that have popped up in recent years, Nissan is using old batteries to power small robots; French carmaker Groupe Renault, with partners, is launching stationary energy storage systems made with old EV batteries; and Audi Environmental Foundation, the daughter organization of Audi AG, worked with Indian startup Nunam to build solar nanogrids out of used e-tron battery modules.</p>
<p>Other OEMs, like Lucid Motors, BMW and Proterra, are incorporating reuse principles into their battery design. In fact, Lucid has built its batteries to work across its electric vehicle and energy storage products, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/">including in second-life uses</a>, Chief Engineer Eric Bach told TechCrunch. And BMW has used a &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; concept with the batteries in its i3 model so that they can be easily removed and inserted into second-life applications, BMW spokesperson Weiland Bruch said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;We believe that battery second-life will become its own self-standing business field,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>A new lease on battery life</h2>
<p>Automakers are increasingly bullish on second-life uses, though the size of their role in this budding market is still unclear. Matthew Lumsden, CEO of U.K.-based Connected Energy, told TechCrunch that he has noticed a shift in the past two years where some OEMs have begun viewing batteries as an asset rather than a liability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in a twist, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced a proposal for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups, TechCrunch has learned exclusively. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black and Latinx Seed Fund will be administered by the New Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said based on research conducted by the state, that New Jersey is the first state in the nation to develop this type of fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the move is a “direct response </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the systemic racial inequities in access to capital for Black and brown entrepreneurs” and aimed at addressing “the racial wealth gap.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think two of the centerpieces of Gov. Murphy&#8217;s strategy overall for the economy is to build a stronger and fairer New Jersey and a stronger and fairer economy,” Sullivan said, adding that the state is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also focused on “reclaiming New Jersey&#8217;s heritage of leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a known fact that the number of venture dollars flowing to Black and Latinx founders is dismally low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one evidence of that, last year </span><a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/2020-diversity-spotlight-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that as of Aug. 31, Black and Latinx founders had raised $2.3 billion in funding, representing just 2.6% of the total $87.3 billion in funding that had gone to all founders up until that point in 2020.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Digitalundivided’s ProjectDiane 2020 report found that Black and Latinx women founders received just $1.7 billion of the total $276.7 billion venture dollars invested between 2018 and 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several months &#8212; in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement &#8212; we’ve seen an increasing number of venture funds </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announce initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward funding a broader group of founders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before there was a Silicon Valley, whether you&#8217;re talking about folks like Thomas Edison, Bell Labs or Sarnoff Labs, we were the place that perhaps more than any other place that fueled 20th century American entrepreneurial-led growth,” Sullivan told TechCrunch. “And the reality is that we lost a little bit of that. We&#8217;re still one of the top places for innovation and entrepreneurship, but other places &#8211;whether it&#8217;s out west or in places like Austin and Boston &#8212; have really upped their game and we want to recapture that unquestioned leadership position in innovation, entrepreneurship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that — under Gov. Murphy&#8217;s leadership — the state wants “to build the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a lot easier said than done, particularly because of not only centuries worth of systemic discrimination and racism, but some very specific manifestations of that systemic disenfranchisement and discrimination, particularly around venture capital funding and early-stage seed funding,” added Sullivan, who once worked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Barclays Capital as chief of staff to the head of Global Investment Banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zakiya Smith Ellis, chief policy advisor to Gov. Murphy, said the initiative came after conversations with Black and Latinx business investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his was developed with the input of folks who might be direct beneficiaries of this program and that community was directly impactful in designing and developing this proposal,” Smith Ellis told TechCrunch. “We hear from them ‘we don&#8217;t have the family members, we don&#8217;t have the friends who are just going to write me a check at the very beginning, I think this is really instructive.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature is set to vote on the proposal by July 1.</span><b></b></p>
<p>While it was difficult to find examples of governments doing similar things, there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p>In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals &#8220;of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (<em>Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company</em>).</p>
<p>And, Detroit-based ID Ventures says it invests in minority and women-led companies &#8220;at 4x the national average.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By providing opportunities to underrepresented entrepreneurs, we can ensure representation, respect our state’s diversity, and create a startup community unlike any other,&#8221; the organization&#8217;s website says.</p>
<p>Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders. Founded in 2016 by former Dell executive Preston James, the organization aims to &#8220;e<span class="lt-line-clamp__line">mpower people of color and women entrepreneurs and help them build successful </span><span class="lt-line-clamp__line">high-growth businesses by providing them with access to education, mentorship and vital networks.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The competition for note-taking is as fierce as it has ever been with plenty of highly-valued productivity startups fighting for an audience it can potentially serve endless productivity offshoots. In the past year, Notion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">raised at</a> a $2 billion valuation, Coda <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/08/11/coda-startup-backed-by-kleiner-perkins-and-greylock-raises-80-million/?sh=47f5f8ab7825">raised at</a> $636 million, and Roam <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-200-million-seed-valuation-for-roam-shows-investor-frenzy-for-note-taking-apps">raised at</a> $200 million.</p>
<p>A new competitor in the space is emerging out of stealth with fresh funding from Andreessen Horowitz. The free app, called <a href="https://mem.ai/">Mem</a>, is an early access platform dedicated to pushing users to quickly jot down their thoughts without focusing too heavily on the underlying organization of them. The startup&#8217;s founders have vast ambitions for what their platform could become down the road, tapping into further advances in machine learning and even AR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really the differentiation is [information] that is summonable ubiquitously wherever you are,&#8221; Mem co-founder Kevin Moody tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So, in the near term, through your desktop app with Mem Spotlight as a heads-up display for wherever you are, in the medium term through an assistive mobile application, and then in the long term, imagine contact lenses that are overlaying useful content to you in the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moody and his co-founder Dennis Xu tell TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $5.6 million in a seed round led by a16z with additional participation from their Cultural Leadership Fund, Will Smith&#8217;s dreamers.vc, Floodgate, Unusual Ventures and Shrug Capital. The round also was host to a handful of angel investors including Harry Stebbings, Julia Lipton, Tony Liu, Rahul Vohra and Todd Goldberg, among others.</p>
<p>In its current iteration, Mem push users towards &#8220;lightweight organization&#8221; rather than clicking through folders and links to find the perfect place to nestle their thoughts. Users can quickly tag users or dedicated topics in their notes. The user workflow relies pretty heavily on search and chronological organization, presenting users with their most recently accessed notes. Users can also set reminders for certain notes, bringing a popular email framework to note-taking.</p>
<p>For users of stock apps like Apple Notes, these interface quirks may not sound very jarring, though the design is still a departure from apps like Notion and Airtable which have heavily focused on structure over immediacy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134601" style="width: 1449px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134601" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2134601 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1439" height="841" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg 2338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=1536,897 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1197 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-10.08.23-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1439px) 100vw, 1439px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134601" class="wp-caption-text">Mem Spotlight</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps Mem&#8217;s biggest shift is how users access the information they&#8217;ve dumped into the platform. The founders say they want to avoid their app being seen as a &#8220;destination,&#8221; instead hoping users rely heavily on a keyboard-shortcut-prompted overlay called Mem Spotlight that allows them to search out information that they may need for an email, presentation or text message. The broader hope of the founders and investors behind Mem is that the team can leverage the platform&#8217;s intelligence over time to better understand the data dump from your brain &#8212; and likely other information sources across your digital footprint &#8212; to know you better than any ad network or social media graph does.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would it mean to just capture passively your digital footprint and then make use of that as though it were structured,&#8221; Moody posits. &#8220;If we can actually have our own Mem modeling of all of these entities, whether it&#8217;s text, or maybe it&#8217;s contacts, the people that you know, or it&#8217;s the events that you&#8217;re going to and these different sources feed into Mem, what would it mean for Mem to be able to have a product that is the &#8216;you&#8217; API?&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the startup&#8217;s app isn&#8217;t quite as grandiose in scale as what the founders may see in its future, but as Mem continues to onboard early users from its waitlist and add to its desktop functionality, the company is driving towards a platform they hope feels more instrumental to how its users &#8220;remember&#8221; information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wisk Aero, the air mobility company borne out of a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Archer Aviation alleging patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.</p>
<p>Wisk claims in the lawsuit that Archer perpetrated a “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. The lawsuit points to the design of Archer&#8217;s first electric aircraft that was released in February, which Wisk says is a copy of one of its potential designs. That design was submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in January 2020, and Wisk alleges the similarities are too numerous to have been a coincidence.</p>
<p>Wisk further claims that during a forensic investigation it opened after Archer hired 10 former Wisk engineers, one of those hires secretly downloaded thousands of files before his departure. Another engineer also downloaded files, the suit alleges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The information contained in the stolen files includes systems designs, test data, and aircraft designs, Wisk <a href="https://wisk.aero/blog/040621-blog-post/">said in a blog posted Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>“As our Complaint explains, the design Archer disclosed above reflects its insider knowledge of Wisk’s extensive aerodynamic test and evaluation data based on years of experimentation and modeling,” the company said in the blog post. “The similarity in overall aircraft design further indicates Archer’s use of more detailed design features, including features related to aircraft propulsion, power management, avionics, flight control, and manufacturing methodology.”</p>
<p>Archer has snagged some major wins in 2021, including an announcement in February that it would merge with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp. for an equity valuation of $3.8 billion. Also in February, the Palo Alto, California-based startup landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">a $1 billion order</a> with United Airlines as a customer and investor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s regrettable that Wisk would engage in litigation in an attempt to deflect from the business issues that have caused several of its employees to depart,&#8221; an Archer spokesperson said in an email to TechCrunch. The plaintiff raised these matters over a year ago, and after looking into them thoroughly, we have no reason to believe any proprietary Wisk technology ever made its way to Archer.  We intend to defend ourselves vigorously.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Archer spokesperson added that the company has &#8220;placed an employee on paid administrative leave in connection with a government investigation and a search warrant issued to the employee, which we believe are focused on conduct prior to the employee joining the company. Archer and three other Archer employees with whom the individual worked also have received subpoenas relating to this investigation, and all are fully cooperating with the authorities.”</p>
<p>The suit was filed with the California Northern District Court under case no. 5:21-cv-02450.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is adding an electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck to its lineup, as the automaker pushes to deliver more than 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025.</p>
<p>GM President Mark Reuss said Tuesday that the Chevrolet Silverado electric full-size pickup will be based on the automaker&#8217;s Ultium battery platform and will have an estimated range of more than 400 miles on a full charge. It should be noted this is GM&#8217;s forecast not an official EPA figure.</p>
<p>GM is positioning the full-sized pickup for both consumer and commercial markets. Reuss said that retail and fleet versions of the Silverado electric pickup will be offered with a variety of options and configurations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m particularly excited about its potential in the fleet and commercial space, a crucial part of the EV market, especially initially,&#8221; Reuss said during a presentation at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck.</p>
<p>The electric Silverado will go head to head with Ford&#8217;s upcoming electric F-150. And while new EV entrant Rivian is not going after the commercial market, its electric R1T pickup will also provide competition in the space. Rivian is expected to begin deliveries of its electric R1T pickup truck this summer.</p>
<p>The news also follows a string of announcements over the past 18 months, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">GM&#8217;s Ultium battery platform</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launch of BrightDrop</a>, an a new business unit to offer commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products. BrightDrop will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1.</p>
<p>Last year, GM committed more than $27 billion to EV and AV product development, including $7 billion in 2021 and plans to launch 30 EVs globally by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds available in North America.</p>
<p>Reuss said that the company will build the Silverado electric pickup truck at the company&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan. He confirmed that the GMC Hummer EV SUV, which was unveiled over the weekend, will also be built at the factory. GM renamed its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant &#8220;Factory ZERO&#8221; in October 2020 and later said it would invest $2.2 billion in the factory to produce a variety of all-electric trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>The facility, which is is undergoing a complete renovation and retooling and has expanded to more than 4.5 million square feet, will also produce the GMC Hummer EV pickup and the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built, all-electric and shared self-driving vehicle. Production of the GMC Hummer EV pickup will begin later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Esri</a>, the geographic information system (GIS), mapping and spatial analytics company, is hosting its (virtual) <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/overview">developer summit today</a>. Unsurprisingly, it is making a couple of major announcements at the event that range from a new design system and improved JavaScript APIs to support for running <a href="https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/">ArcGIS Enterprise</a> in containers on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes project was a major undertaking for the company, <span class="il">Esri</span> Product Managers Trevor Seaton and Philip Heede told me. Traditionally, like so many similar products, ArcGIS was architected to be installed on physical boxes, virtual machines or cloud-hosted VMs. And while it doesn&#8217;t really matter to end-users where the software runs, containerizing the application means that it is far easier for businesses to scale their systems up or down as needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a lot of customers &#8212; especially some of the larger customers &#8212; that run very complex questions,&#8221; Seaton explained. &#8220;And sometimes it&#8217;s unpredictable. They might be responding to seasonal events or business events or economic events, and they need to understand not only what&#8217;s going on in the world, but also respond to their many users from outside the organization coming in and asking questions of the systems that they put in place using ArcGIS. And that unpredictable demand is one of the key benefits of Kubernetes.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134535" style="width: 349px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134535" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2134535" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg" alt="Deploying Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes" width="339" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=130,150 130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=260,300 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=768,884 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=590,680 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArcGIS-Enterprise-Kubernetes-Config.jpg?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134535" class="wp-caption-text">Deploying Esri ArcGIS Enterprise on Kubernetes. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Esri</p></div></p>
<p>The team could have chosen to go the easy route and put a wrapper around its existing tools to containerize them and call it a day, but as Seaton noted, Esri used this opportunity to re-architect its tools and break it down into microservices.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken us a while because we took three or four big applications that together make up [ArcGIS] Enterprise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we broke those apart into a much larger set of microservices. That allows us to containerize specific services and add a lot of high availability and resilience to the system without adding a lot of complexity for the administrators &#8212; in fact, we&#8217;re reducing the complexity as we do that and all of that gets installed in one single deployment script.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Kubernetes simplifies a lot of the management experience, a lot of companies that use ArcGIS aren&#8217;t yet familiar with it. And as Seaton and Heede noted, the company isn&#8217;t forcing anyone onto this platform. It will continue to support Windows and Linux just like before. Heede also stressed that it&#8217;s still unusual &#8212; especially in this industry &#8212; to see a complex, fully integrated system like ArcGIS being delivered in the form of microservices and multiple containers that its customers then run on their own infrastructure.</p>

<p>In addition to the Kubernetes announcement, Esri also today announced new JavaScript APIs that make it easier for developers to create applications that bring together Esri&#8217;s server-side technology and the scalability of doing much of the analysis on the client-side. Back in the day, Esri would support tools like Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex">Adobe/Apache Flex</a> for building rich web-based applications. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;re really focusing on a single web development technology and the toolset around that,&#8221; Esri product manager Julie Powell told me.</p>
<p>A bit later this month, Esri also plans to launch its new design system to make it easier and faster for developers to create clean and consistent user interfaces. This design system will launch April 22, but the company already provided a bit of a teaser today. As Powell noted, the challenge for Esri is that its design system has to help the company&#8217;s partners put their own style and branding on top of the maps and data they get from the ArcGIS ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is abuzz with the news that Topps, a company perhaps best known for making collectible trading cards, is <a href="https://www.mudrickcapitalacquisitioncorp.com/static-files/d04b0221-2195-4b87-b305-63b55bde4e61">going public via a SPAC</a>.</p>
<p>The reverse merger with its chosen blank-check company values the combination on an equity basis at $1.163 billion. That makes Topps some sort of unicorn. And because it has both e-commerce and digital angles, Topps is technically a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/is-a-tomato-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable"><del>fruit</del></a> tech company.</p>

<hr />
<p>Why do we care? We care because Topps and its products are popular with the same set of folks who are very excited about creating rare digital items on particular blockchains. Yes, the baseball card company is going public in a debut that could easily be read as a way to put money into the NFT craze without actually having to buy cryptocurrencies and go speculating itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And Topps apparently owns a number of assets in the candy space, which I find whimsical.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a small giggle as we go through the Topps deck and then ask if the company is being valued on its actual, and modestly attractive, present-day business or on possible revenues from future NFT-related activities.</p>
<h2>So, trading cards</h2>
<p>What is Topps? A mix of business units that it breaks down into four categories: Physical Sports and Entertainment (trading cards), Digital Sports and Entertainment (digital collectibles, apps and games), Gift Cards (gift cards for external brands) and Confections (candy).</p>
<p>In terms of scale, the company&#8217;s physical goods and confection businesses are by far its leading revenue drivers. Here&#8217;s the data:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134461" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134461" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2134461 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?w=680" alt="Chart showing Topps revenue" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png 934w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-06-at-9.09.54-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Topps investor presentation</p></div></p>
<p>First, observe that the company&#8217;s <em>pro forma adjusted EBITDA</em> nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020. That&#8217;s an aggressive expansion in hyperadjusted profitability. Note how much the company&#8217;s physical sports business grew from 2019 to 2020; a nearly 50% gain helped the company grow nicely last year.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook confirms it&#8217;s testing a new QR code feature and payment links for use with Facebook Pay to make it easier for people in the U.S. to send or request money from one another. The QR code feature, similar to Venmo&#8217;s QR codes and others, will allow a user to scan a friend&#8217;s code with their smartphone&#8217;s camera to send or request money, while the sharable payment links will let you publish your payment address outside of Facebook itself.</p>
<p>The addition was first spotted on Monday by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/facebook-pay-qr-code-payments/">MacRumors</a>, which noted that users were being presented with a new &#8220;Scan&#8221; button in the Facebook Pay carousel at the top of the screen. When you tap this button, you&#8217;re launched into an experience where you can scan the other person&#8217;s code. The screen that displays the QR code also introduces the personalized payment URL in the format of &#8220;https://m.me/pay/UserName,&#8221; which can also be sent to others when you&#8217;re making a payment or sending a request.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134505" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134505" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/fb-pay-qr.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134505" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of FB Pay QR code (blurred for privacy)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the feature&#8217;s launch, but characterized it as a &#8220;test&#8221; that&#8217;s currently taking place in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make payments on Messenger even easier, we’ve begun testing the ability for people to use QR codes and payment links when they want to send or request money,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/574381195996811?helpref=uf_permalink">Only U.S. users</a> are able to send payments through Messenger at this time, they also noted.</p>
<p>Users who want to be able to send and receive money in Messenger have to be at least 18 years old, and will have to have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">Visa or Mastercard debit card</a>, a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775"> PayPal account</a> or one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1528535330720775">supported</a> prepaid cards or government-issued cards, in order to use the payments feature. They&#8217;ll also need to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/217942441564255/">set</a> their preferred currency to U.S. dollars in the app.</p>
<p>Facebook first launched its Facebook Pay service in November 2019, as a way to establish a single payment system that can extend across the company&#8217;s apps. However, the service as it stands today is not necessarily a rival to other apps like PayPal, because Facebook currently partners with PayPal as one of the supported payment methods.</p>
<p>Currently, Facebook Pay powers the payments experience across a number of areas in Facebook, which are focused on commerce, donations and tipping &#8212; like Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Shop, Buy on Instagram and for other activities &#8212; like buying Stars to support gaming Creators, buying tickets to live events, making donations to causes and more. Users can also send money to friends on Messenger through a built-in button.</p>
<p>For the time being, this payments experience is separate from Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/">cryptocurrency wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi,</a> though one could imagine that in time the two will become more integrated.</p>
<p>Facebook declined to share further details about the test, including how many or what percentage of users will see the new QR codes and links or when tests began and when they&#8217;ll end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it’s true the VC world has gone SPAC-happy, the reverse merger method hasn’t been a huge driver in robotics thus far, with some notable exceptions<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/"> like Berkshire-Grey</a>. This morning, however, Utah-based Sarcos Robotics <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406005563/en/Sarcos-Robotics-to-Merge-with-Rotor-Acquisition-Corp.">announced plans</a> to board the SPAC train, courtesy of Rotor Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>The deal could potentially value the robotic exoskeleton maker and blank check co. at a combined $1.3 billion, along with a potential $281 million earn-out. Sarcos is, of course, one of a number of companies currently exploring the robotic exoskeleton category. So, what sets the company apart, beyond some heavy-duty James Cameron-style design language?</p>
<p>Partnership are always a big motivator. Sarcos lined up a pretty big one way back at CES 2020. It was positioned at the center of Delta’s big tech push at the trade show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Delta’s employees are the key ingredient to our success, and we are committed to reducing on-the-job injuries as well as fostering workforce diversity and improving worker longevity for a healthier and safer team,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in today’s announcement. “My enthusiasm for Sarcos’ potential has only grown since then as we continue to work closely with Sarcos to turn our everyday heroes into superheroes, making their jobs safer and easier than ever.”</p>
<p>At the time, the airline announced that it would be partnering with the company to pilot these exoskeletons among its staff. The robotics-maker noted then that the tech can be used to lift 200-pound payloads for up to eight hours, without tiring the wearer. It’s in line with Sarcos’ more industrial-minded approach to wearable robotics.</p>

<p>Later that same year, the company announced a $40 million raise aimed at commercializing its Guardian XO unit. In today’s release, it adds that it expects to deliver the system at some point in the middle of next year, with the teleoperated Guardian XT arriving the following.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead data protection regulator in the European Union is seeking answers from the tech giant over a major data breach reported on over the weekend.</p>
<p>The breach was reported on by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">Business Insider</a> on Saturday which said personal data (including email addresses and mobile phone numbers) of more than 500M Facebook accounts had been posted to a low level hacking forum &#8212; making the personal information on hundreds of millions of Facebook users&#8217; accounts freely available.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exposed data includes the personal information of over 533M Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32M records on users in the US, 11M on users in the UK, and 6M on users in India,&#8221; Business Insider said, noting that the dump includes phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and some email addresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook responded to the report of the data dump by saying it related to a vulnerability in its platform it had &#8220;found and fixed&#8221; in August 2019 &#8212; dubbing the info &#8220;old data&#8221; which it also claimed had been reported on in 2019. However as security experts were <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/1378471695930040321">quick to point out</a>, most people don&#8217;t change their mobile phone number often &#8212; so Facebook&#8217;s trigger reaction to downplay the breach looks like an ill-thought through attempt to deflect blame.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not clear whether all the data is all &#8216;old&#8217;, as Facebook&#8217;s initial response suggests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019. <a href="https://t.co/mPCttLkjzE">https://t.co/mPCttLkjzE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Liz Bourgeois (@Liz_Shepherd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Shepherd/status/1378398417450377222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of reasons for Facebook to try to downplay yet another data scandal. Not least because, under European Union data protection rules, there are stiff penalties for companies that fail to promptly report significant breaches to relevant authorities. And indeed for breaches themselves &#8212; as the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) bakes in an expectation of security by design and default.</p>
<p>By pushing the claim that the leaked data is &#8220;old&#8221; Facebook may be hoping to peddle the idea that it predates the GDPR coming into application (in May 2018).</p>
<p>However the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU, told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s not abundantly clear whether that&#8217;s the case at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The newly published dataset seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset and combined with additional records, which may be from a later period,&#8221; the DPC&#8217;s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;A significant number of the users are EU users. Much of the data appears to been data scraped some time ago from Facebook public profiles,&#8221; he also said.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>&#8220;Previous datasets were published in 2019 and 2018 relating to a large-scale scraping of the Facebook website which at the time Facebook advised occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 when Facebook closed off a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality. Because the scraping took place prior to GDPR, Facebook chose not to notify this as a personal data breach under GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doyle said the regulator sought to establish &#8220;the full facts&#8221; about the breach from Facebook over the weekend and is &#8220;continuing to do so&#8221; &#8212; making it clear that there&#8217;s an ongoing lack of clarity on the issue, despite the breach itself being claimed as &#8220;old&#8221; by Facebook.</p>
<p>The DPC also made it clear that it did not receive any proactive communication from Facebook on the issue &#8212; despite the GDPR putting the onus on companies to proactively inform regulators about significant data protection issues. Rather the regulator had to approach Facebook &#8212; using a number of channels to try to obtain answers from the tech giant.</p>
<p>Through this approach the DPC said it learnt Facebook believes the information was scraped prior to the changes it made to its platform in 2018 and 2019 in light of vulnerabilities identified in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal.</p>
<p>A huge database of Facebook phone numbers was found unprotected online back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">September 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook had also earlier admitted to a vulnerability with a search tool it offered &#8212; revealing in <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/">April 2018</a> that somewhere between 1BN and 2BN users had had their public Facebook information scraped via a feature which allowed people to look up users by inputting a phone number or email &#8212; which is one potential source for the cache of personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/facebook-sues-two-companies-engaged-in-data-scraping-operations/">Last year Facebook also filed a lawsuit</a> against two companies it accused of engaging in an international data scraping operation.</p>
<p>But the fallout from its poor security design choices continue to dog Facebook years after its &#8216;fix&#8217;.</p>
<p>More importantly, the fallout from the massive personal data spill continues to affect Facebook users whose information is now being openly offered for download on the Internet &#8212; opening them up to the risk of spam and phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering (such as for attempted identity theft).</p>
<p>There are still more questions than answers about how this &#8220;old&#8221; cache of Facebook data came to be published online for free on a hacker forum.</p>
<p>The DPC said it was told by Facebook that &#8220;the data at issue appears to have been collated by third parties and potentially stems from multiple sources&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company also claimed the matter &#8220;requires extensive investigation to establish its provenance with a level of confidence sufficient to provide your Office and our users with additional information&#8221; &#8212; which is a long way of suggesting that Facebook has no idea either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook assures the DPC it is giving highest priority to providing firm answers to the DPC,&#8221; Doyle also said. &#8220;A percentage of the records released on the hacker website contain phone numbers and email address of users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Risks arise for users who may be spammed for marketing purposes but equally users need to be vigilant in relation to any services they use that require authentication using a person’s phone number or email address in case third parties are attempting to gain access.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC will communicate further facts as it receives information from Facebook,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment about the breach.</p>
<p>Facebook users who are concerned whether their information is in the dump can <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">run a search</a> for their phone number or email address via the data breach advice site, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-facebook-phone-numbers-are-now-searchable-in-have-i-been-pwned/">haveibeenpwned</a>.</p>
<p>According to haveibeenpwned&#8217;s Troy Hunt, this latest Facebook data dump contains far more mobile phone numbers than email addresses.</p>
<p>He writes that he was sent the data a few weeks ago &#8212; initially getting 370M records and later &#8220;the larger corpus which is now in <em>very </em>broad circulation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it is the same, but a lot of it is also different,&#8221; Hunt also notes, adding: &#8220;There is not one clear source of this data.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year has put a spotlight on mental health, and startup Real is looking to shake up the space with a product that makes group therapy available on-demand.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Ariela Safira, <a href="https://www.join-real.com/">Real</a> is inspired by a longstanding methodology in the world of mental health: Group therapy. AA, for instance, has been around for decades and proven to be incredibly effective for some. But that format isn&#8217;t as readily available across a variety of issues beyond the disease of addiction.</p>
<p>To deploy this service, Real has raised $10 million in Series A financing, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from existing and new investors, including Megan Rapinoe and Minnesota Vikings Linebacker Eric Kendricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Real employs full-time therapists to lead group therapy across a variety of issues, including exploration of sexuality, anxiety, managing anger with family members and other real-world issues. With Real, users pay $28/month to have access to these pathways (as Real calls them), letting users watch these group therapy sessions on-demand and get journal prompts and other resources.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of this platform is that users can get more tactical advice on these things, rather than trying to explore the problems. They also feel less alone, as they see others are struggling with the same things.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Real allows users to tap into the conversations and therapy they need at the time they want it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6VAVSr8KKK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/embed/#?secret=6VAVSr8KKK" data-secret="6VAVSr8KKK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Safira explained that she might be deep in her thoughts and feelings on Wednesday at 11pm, but can&#8217;t get a one-on-one therapy session until 2pm on Monday. Her state may have changed. With Real, she can get online and access the right pathway in the moment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Real&#8217;s research shows that most people doing one-on-one therapy said they went for general anxiety, relationship problems and career advice. However, on Real, the top pathways are sexuality, motherhood and intimacy. The conclusion is that the things people want to work on the most are not always the things they&#8217;re most comfortable digging into in a one-on-one setting.</p>
<p>By scaling group therapy sessions to an on-demand audience, Real has been able to bring the cost of this type of service way down, especially when compared to one-on-one therapy.</p>
<p>Real is the product of many years of work in the mental health space. While she was studying for her undergrad degree at Stanford, Safira&#8217;s friend attempted suicide. It was her first time confronting the mental health system and it made her wonder why the system was designed the way it was. She threw herself in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent two to three years working on how to redesign the mental health care system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That entails visiting and flying to rehab centers, therapy offices, architecture firms that have built those spaces to learn why we make the decisions in mental health care that we make. Things like is there research behind the bright white walls in inpatient mental health facilities, and if not, is that based on legal hurdles or financial hurdles? I really wanted to get into the foundation of how to build a system.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped out of Stanford, then returned to Stanford, then went to Columbia for her masters, and then dropped out of Columbia to start Real. And the time seems to finally be right. Real has attracted investment from big names in institutional VC and big names in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Ariela] looked at something that has been around for so long, therapies in the traditional sense, and flipped it on its head to break up the status quo, and I thought that was really interesting and innovative,&#8221; said Megan Rapinoe in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;There are obviously a lot of barriers to access mental health services, for a lot of different reasons. Hopefully, this platform can make it easier for people to get the help that they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapinoe is but one of the big names invested in Real. She is joined by Gwyneth Paltrow and Eric Kendricks.</p>
<p>Kendricks explained that he had never been averse to therapy but that he learned a lot after meeting his now-fiancé and hearing about her struggles and the struggles of her family, which has dealt with a variety of mental health issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything was going well for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was always playing well in the field, and financially, I&#8217;m making more money than when I was a kid. But I did have moments where I was questioning myself and in my head a lot and it&#8217;s kind of a weird feeling. I had to take a step back and I realized that I was going through a little bit of something. But based on the conversations I had with my fiancé, I used my resources to find the help that I needed and it was amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained that the shift in society&#8217;s mentality around mental health has paved the way for a product like Real, which is a more proactive and preventative approach to mental wellness.</p>
<p>But Real has also been able to react quickly to big events in our world. The company has launched a product called <a href="https://www.realtothepeople.com/">Real to the People</a>, which offers free access to the platform during moments of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and, most recently, the spike in anti-Asian hate crimes.</p>
<p>Nicole Quinn, partner at Lightspeed, explained that the firm has had an interest in the mental health space for a long time. In fact, LSVP is an investor in Calm.</p>

Can we apply that same group method by scaling to other areas. We have a fundamental belief that yes, you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real has raised a total of $16 million since launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok this morning <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/introducing-auto-captions">announced</a> the launch of a new feature designed to make its app accessible to people who are hard of hearing or deaf. The company is today debuting auto captions &#8212; a feature that, when enabled, will automatically transcribe the speech from a video so viewers can read what&#8217;s being said in the video as an alternative to listening. Initially, auto captions will support American English and Japanese, with additional languages coming in the months ahead, TikTok says.</p>
<p>To use auto captions, the creator will select the option on the editing page after they&#8217;ve either uploaded or recorded a video. They can then edit the text that&#8217;s generated in order to correct any mistakes before the video is published.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134473" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134473" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2134473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?w=392" alt="" width="392" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=768,1331 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=392,680 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=887,1536 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=1182,2048 1182w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-4.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though largely designed for accessibility purposes, auto captions can also help those who want to watch TikTok videos without the sound &#8212; for example, when you&#8217;re around other people you don&#8217;t want to disturb, but lack headphones. They also can be useful for those watching videos where they&#8217;re not fluent in the language being spoken, as it&#8217;s sometimes easier to understand what&#8217;s said when you can also read the words.</p>
<p>Already, many in the TikTok community had <a href="https://www.bustle.com/life/how-to-add-closed-captions-tiktok-videos-subtitles-apps">embraced captioning</a> by adding text overlays to their videos or using third-party subtitling tools. The <a href="https://screenrant.com/tiktok-text-to-speech-voice-effect-how-explained/">text-to-speech trend</a>, where text on screen is read in a Siri-like voice, has remained a popular technique among creators, too.</p>

<p>But the auto captions tool will work differently from existing options because it can be turned on and off by the viewer. That means you wouldn&#8217;t have to see the video captions if you don&#8217;t want to. To turn the captions off, you&#8217;ll first open the share panel, then tap the captions button to disable them.</p>

<p>With the launch of auto captions, TikTok joins other social apps like <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpotentially-inappropriate-words-in-automatic-captions%2Cautomatic-captions-on-videos-on-demand">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.oktopost.com/blog/enhance-your-videos-with-facebooks-automatic-caption-generator/">Facebook and Instagram</a>, which already offer tools that allow creators to easily and automatically add captions to videos.</p>
<p>TikTok says it will be working to spread the word among its creator community about the new addition to encourage users to make their videos accessible to a wider audience.</p>

<p>Auto captions are now one of several accessibility features TikTok has launched, alongside creator warnings when they produce videos that could trigger photosensitive epilepsy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/new-tiktok-feature-allows-users-to-avoid-videos-with-epileptic-seizure-triggers/">a photosensitivity feature</a> that allows users to skip photosensitive content.

<p>TikTok says it&#8217;s currently undergoing an accessibility assessment to identify additional areas for improvement, as well, and has worked with the organization <a href="https://thedeafcollective.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thedeafcollective.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617745971063000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPXsrikbuNaUJ6ZMOGRi-McStRmg">The Deaf Collective</a> to increase awareness toward the talent and conversations taking place in deaf communities on its app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A partnership between the University of North Carolina&#8217;s Kenan Flagler Entrepreneurship Center, the <a href="https://opportunityhub.co/ourstory/">Opportunity Hub</a> and <a href="https://blackangels.co/">100 Black Angels and Allies Fund</a>, set up to improve representation and support of diverse founders in the tech industry, is getting more heavy-hitting partners from Duke and Stanford.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, faculty affiliated with Stanford and Duke will join educators to staff the <a href="https://eship.unc.edu/course/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-solutions-deis-certificate-program/?utm_source=Eship&amp;utm_medium=deis%20announce&amp;utm_campaign=deis%20LP">DEIS Practicum Certificate</a> and <a href="https://eship.unc.edu/course/black-technology-ecosystem-investment-certificate/?utm_source=Eship&amp;utm_medium=deis%20announce&amp;utm_campaign=investors%20LP">Black Technology Ecosystem Investment Certificate</a> programs, which, respectively, try to address ways in which management can engage in diversity and inclusion in a systemic way beyond simply human resources hires and equity in compensation and ways in which more Black investors can become involved in backing startups. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to address issues like DEI at a systemic organizational level and to address the pervasive issues causing the wealth gap, we need to work together to help make this kind of education more readily available,” said Entrepreneurship Center Executive Director Vickie Gibbs, in a statement. “Together, we are taking action and making progress toward creating a more equitable society and entrepreneurial community.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The addition of affiliated faculty from the Stanford Technology Ventures program and Duke University does more than just further validate the program, according to Rodney Sampson, the executive chairman and chief executive of OHUB and co-founder and general partner of 199 Black Allies &amp; Angels fund. For Sampson, who also serves as a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina and Duke, the addition of the two schools will mean more exposure among the two universities&#8217; alumni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also expands the reach of these solutions and insights into the alumni and entrepreneurial communities of these two amazing universities,&#8221; said Sampson in a statement. </span></p>
<p>The framework that Sampson has developed involves a multipronged approach for employers that includes: a review of the extent to which diversity, equity and inclusion is operationalized in corporate boards and governance; in assessments of hiring, promotion and human resources practices; in procurement and vendor services; in innovation and product development; in resources on going to market to reach diverse audiences; in investments into Black and Latino communities; and in monitoring the impact of the business&#8217; operations on the community.</p>
<p>The framework was recently cited in a report from no less auspicious an organization than the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/from-commitments-to-action-how-ceos-can-advance-racial-equity-in-their-regional-economies/">Brookings Institution</a> in a paper authored by Amy Liu and Reniya Dinkins.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When chief executives demonstrate their own work to dismantle bias and create a culture of true belonging, it provides a level of trust and credibility needed for these firms and leaders to collaborate with others in bringing about broader progress and sustained prosperity in their home regions,&#8221; the authors wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Stanford University in particular, the opportunity to embrace diversity and education training comes as the university tries to rehabilitate an image tarnished after its rush to embrace policies crafted by the former White House administration that called for<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/17/stanford-rushes-to-comply-with-trump-executive-order-limiting-diversity-training/"> universities to limit diversity training</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For too long, diversity, equity and inclusion have been an afterthought in entrepreneurship and innovation. I am grateful to be collaborating with thoughtful, action-oriented colleagues to address systemic racism. Together, we&#8217;ll be able to create important new network connections between our organizations and to develop learning insights that can be shared with educators and organizations around the world,&#8221; added Tom Byers, Keohane Distinguished Visiting Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University and STVP Faculty Director.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sonos has a new speaker that starts shipping later this month, and it&#8217;s a significant departure from the company&#8217;s usual offerings in a number of ways. The all-new <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html">Sonos Roam</a> is a compact, portable speaker with a built-in battery and Bluetooth connectivity — but still very much a Sonos system team player, with wifi streaming, multi-room feature, voice assistant support and surprisingly great sound quality.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Priced at $169, the Sonos Roam is truly diminutive, at just over 6 inches, by roughly 2.5 inches for both height and depth. It weighs under a pound, and is available in either a matte white or black finish, which is par for the course for Sonos in terms of colorways. Roam is also IP67-rated, meaning it&#8217;s effectively waterproof, with a resistance rating of up to 30 minutes at depths of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet).</p>
<p>Sonos has placed the speaker&#8217;s control surface at one end of the device, including a microphone button, volume controls and a play/pause button. These are actual, tactile buttons, rather than touch-sensitive surfaces like you&#8217;d find on other Sonos speakers, which makes sense for a speaker designed to be used on the go, and in conditions where touch controls might get flummoxed by things like rain and water.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>The Roam also has a power button on the back, next to a USB-C port for charging. It also offers wireless charging, via a receiver found in the base of the speaker, which can be used with Sonos&#8217; own forthcoming magnetic charging adapter (sold separately), or with any standard Qi-powered wireless charger you want.</p>
<p>In addition to wifi streaming, Sonos Roam can also connect to any device via Bluetooth 5.0. It also features AirPlay 2 for connecting to Apple devices when on wifi, and it works out of the box with Spotify Connect. The built-in battery is rated for up to 10 hours of playback on a full charge, according to Sonos, and can also provide up to 10 days of its sleep-like standby mode.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p>This is the smallest speaker yet released by Sonos, and that&#8217;s definitely a big plus when it comes to this category of device. The dimensions make it feel like a slightly taller can of Red Bull, which should give you some sense of just how portable it is. Unlike Sonos&#8217; first portable speaker with a built-in battery, the Sonos Move, the Roam truly feels like something designed to be thrown in a bag and brought with you wherever you happen to need it.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, the Sonos Roam offers impressive sound — likely the best I&#8217;ve yet encountered for a portable speaker in this size class. Inside, it manages to pack in dual amplifiers, one tweeter and a separate custom racetrack mid-woofer, which Sonos developed to help deliver both lows and mids with a faithfulness that normally escapes smaller speakers. The Roam also gets a lot louder than you&#8217;d probably expect it could, while keeping audio quality clear and free of distortion at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>One of the keys to the Roam&#8217;s great sound quality is Sonos&#8217; Automatic Trueplay tech, which tunes the audio to best suit its surroundings actively and continually. This feature requires that the mic be enabled to work, but it&#8217;s well worth having on in most settings, and makes a big difference while streaming in both Bluetooth and wifi modes. This also helps the speaker adjust when it&#8217;s switched from horizontal to vertical orientation, and it&#8217;s one of the main reasons that the Roam punches above its weight relative to other speakers in this size and price category.</p>
<p>The Roam would be a winner based on audio quality alone for the price, but the extra Sonos system-specific features it boasts really elevate it to a true category leader. These include a standby mode that preserves battery while keeping the Roam available to your system for wifi streaming via the Sonos app (handy, and also optional since you can hold the power button down for five seconds to truly power off and preserve your charge for even longer, which is great for travel).</p>
<p>One of Roam&#8217;s truly amazing abilities is a hand-off feature that passes playback of whatever you&#8217;re using it to listen to on to the nearest Sonos speaker in your system when you long press the play/pause button. This works almost like magic, and is a great speaker superpower for if you&#8217;re wandering around the house and the yard doing chores with the Roam in your pocket.</p>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2134426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sonos-roam-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Bottom line</h2>
<p>Sonos waited a long time to release their first travel-friendly portable speaker, but they obviously used that time wisely. The Sonos Roam is the most thoughtfully-designed, feature-rich and best-sounding portable speaker you can get for under $200 (and better than many more expensive options, at that). Even if you don&#8217;t already have a Sonos system to use it with, it&#8217;s an easy choice if you&#8217;re in the market for a portable, rugged Bluetooth speaker — and if you&#8217;re already a Sonos convert, the decision gets that much easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning (ML) models are only as good as the data you feed them. That&#8217;s true during training, but also once a model is put in production. In the real world, the data itself can change as new events occur and even small changes to how databases and APIs report and store data could have implications on how the models react. Since ML models will simply give you wrong predictions and not throw an error, it&#8217;s imperative that businesses monitor their data pipelines for these systems.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where tools like <a href="https://www.aporia.com/">Aporia</a> come in. The Tel Aviv-based company today announced that it has raised a $5 million seed round for its monitoring platform for ML models. The investors are Vertex Ventures and TLV Partners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134288" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134288" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/screen1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aporia</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aporia co-founder and CEO Liran Hason, after five years with the Israel Defense Forces, previously worked on the data science team at Adallom, a security company that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/microsoft-confirms-purchase-of-cloud-security-firm-adallom/">acquired by Microsoft in 2015</a>. After the sale, he joined venture firm Vertex Ventures before starting Aporia in late 2019. But it was during his time at Adallom where he first encountered the problems that Aporio is now trying to solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was responsible for the production architecture of the machine learning models,&#8221; he said of his time at the company. &#8220;So that&#8217;s actually where, for the first time, I got to experience the challenges of getting models to production and all the surprises that you get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea behind Aporia, Hason explained, is to make it easier for enterprises to implement machine learning models and leverage the power of AI in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI is a super powerful technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But unlike traditional software, it highly relies on the data. Another unique characteristic of AI, which is very interesting, is that when it fails, it fails silently. You get no exceptions, no errors. That becomes really, really tricky, especially when getting to production, because in training, the data scientists have full control of the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Hason noted, a production system may depend on data from a third-party vendor and that vendor may one day change the data schema without telling anybody about it. At that point, a model &#8212; say for predicting whether a bank&#8217;s customer may default on a loan &#8212; can&#8217;t be trusted anymore, but it may take weeks or months before anybody notices.</p>

<p>Aporia constantly tracks the statistical behavior of the incoming data and when that drifts too far away from the training set, it will alert its users.</p>
<p>One thing that makes Aporia unique is that it gives its users an almost IFTTT or Zapier-like graphical tool for setting up the logic of these monitors. It comes pre-configured with more than 50 combinations of monitors and provides full visibility in how they work behind the scenes. That, in turn, allows businesses to fine-tune the behavior of these monitors for their own specific business case and model.</p>
<p>Initially, the team thought it could build generic monitoring solutions. But the team realized that this wouldn&#8217;t only be a very complex undertaking, but that the data scientists who build the models also know exactly how those models should work and what they need from a monitoring solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monitoring production workloads is a well-established software engineering practice, and it&#8217;s past time for machine learning to be monitored at the same level,&#8221; said Rona <span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.31">Segev</span>, founding partner at  <span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.32">TLV</span> Partners. &#8220;<span id="m_-8268495363104750682gmail-m_4802936678506691575gmail-m_8577113331375561002:2x4.33"><span class="il">Aporia</span>&#8216;s</span> team has strong production-engineering experience, which makes their solution stand out as simple, secure and robust.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its <a href="https://www.okta.com/oktane21/">Oktane21</a> conference, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, the popular authentication and identity platform, today <a href="https://www.okta.com/press/the-new-okta-developer-experience">announced</a> a new &#8212; and free &#8212; developer edition that features fewer limitations and support for significantly more monthly active users than its current free plan.</p>
<p>The new &#8216;<span class="il">Okta</span> Starter Developer Edition,&#8217; as it&#8217;s called, allows developers to scale up to 15,000 monthly active users &#8212; up from only 1,000 on its existing free plan. In addition, the company is also launching enhanced documentation, a set of sample apps and new SDKs, which now cover languages and frameworks like Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Vue.js, React Native and Spring Boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our overall philosophy isn&#8217;t, &#8216;we want to just provide [&#8230;] a set of authentication and authorization services.&#8217; The way we&#8217;re looking at this is, &#8216;hey, app developer, how do we provide you the foundation you need to get up and running quickly with authorization and authentication as one part of it,&#8217; &#8221; Diya Jolly, Okta&#8217;s chief product officer, told me. And she believes that Okta is in a unique position to do so, because it doesn&#8217;t only offer tools to manage authorization and access, but also systems for securing microservices and providing applications with access to privileged resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2134328" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sample-apps.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134328" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134328" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sample-apps.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="580" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134328" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that, while the deal hasn&#8217;t closed yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">Okta&#8217;s intent to acquire Auth0</a> significantly extends its developer strategy, given Auth0&#8217;s developer-first approach.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cj0rER7Dju"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/">Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/embed/#?secret=cj0rER7Dju" data-secret="cj0rER7Dju" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As for the expanded free account, Jolly noted that the company found that developers wanted to be able to access more of the service&#8217;s features during their prototyping phases. That means the new free Developer Edition comes with support for multi-factor authentication, machine-to-machine tokens and B2B integrations, for example, in addition to expanded support for integrations into toolchains. As is so often the case with enterprise tools, the free edition doesn&#8217;t come with the usual enterprise support options and has lower rate limits than the paid plans.</p>
<p>Still, and Jolly acknowledged this, a small to medium-sized business may be able to build applications and take them into production based on this new free plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;15K [monthly active users] is is a lot, but if you look at our customer base, it&#8217;s about the right amount for the smaller business applications, the real SMBs, and that was the goal. In a developer motion, you want people to try out things and then upgrade. I think that&#8217;s the key. No developer is going to come and build with you if you don&#8217;t have a free offering that they can tinker around and play with.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134339" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dev-onboarding-UI.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134339" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2134339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dev-onboarding-UI.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="528" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2134339" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p>
<p>She noted that the company has spent a lot of time thinking about how to support developers through the application development lifecycle overall. That includes better CLI tools for developers who would rather bypass Okta&#8217;s web-based console, for example, and additional integrations with tools like Terraform, Kong and Heroku. &#8220;Today, [developers] have to stitch together identity and Okta into those experiences &#8212; or they use some other identity &#8212; we&#8217;ve pre-stitched all of this for them,&#8221; Jolly said.</p>
<p>The new Okta Starter Developer Edition, as well as the new documentation, sample applications and integrations, are now available at <a href="http://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital transformation is the name of the game these days, and companies that are enabling businesses to take a leap into the future, by helping them tackle their most complex operations, are reaping the rewards. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.onestreamsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneStream</a>, a startup that provides a toolkit of services to enterprises to help them run financial operations (for example, reporting, planning, tax and more), has raised $200 million in primary equity. The funding values OneStream at $6 billion.</p>
<p>D1 Capital Partners led the financing, with participation from Tiger Global and Investment Group of Santa Barbara (IGSB), the company said. Tiger Global and D1 appear to share at least one common backer, Tiger Management, which may be one reason why you see them together in many big deals.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding to continue building out the tools that it provides to customers, and to keep up with demand for its services as more customers replace legacy applications and very basic, spreadsheet-based operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We remain sharply focused on delivering innovative planning, reporting and analysis solutions designed to help our customers succeed for today’s fast-paced and increasingly complex business environment,&#8221; said Tom Shea, CEO of <span class="il">OneStream</span> Software, in a statement. &#8220;The valuation we received is great recognition of the value our employees and stakeholders have helped to create, as well as the exciting opportunities ahead for <span class="il">OneStream</span>.”</p>
<p>To put these large numbers into some context, OneStream was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kkr-agrees-to-take-majority-stake-in-financial-software-maker-onestream-11549535401">valued at $1 billion only two years ago</a>, when KKR took a majority stake in the company worth more than $500 million. The company&#8217;s CFO, Bill Koefoed, has confirmed to us that KKR will continue to be &#8220;substantially OneStream’s largest shareholder and remains a very supportive investor&#8221;. The company meanwhile appears to be holding off any plans for going public for the time being &#8212; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/02/25/kkr-owned-onestream-software-could-go-public/?sh=159d4f047a90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite some possible hints</a> that it was considering that move.</p>
<p>&#8220;OneStream is currently focused on delivering 100% customer access, continuing to grow the business and creating value for stakeholders,&#8221; Koefoed said. &#8220;IPO is a potential exit and OneStream is preparing to be a public company. However, there is no specific timeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growth in valuation, meanwhile, reflects the surge of business that OneStream has seen in the last two years, and in particular in the last 12 months, as companies have been compelled to update their systems to work more efficiently and flexibly amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it has had around in-person interactions. OneStream said annual recurring revenue grew 85% in 2020, with customers growing by 40% to 650 enterprises.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus is specifically in the area commonly called corporate performance management (CPM), which includes a number of the financial corporate operations that a company runs behind the scenes to keep its business ticking.</p>
<p>Some of these would have fallen to a range of software providers, and much of the work would have been carried out by way of on-premise solutions, with companies like SAP, Oracle Hyperion and IBM dominating the space with all-in solutions, and others like Anaplan and Blackline providing point solutions addressing specific aspects of those functions.</p>
<p>But as with other areas of enterprise services, the advances of technology and software have created opportunities to take a lot of that functionality into the cloud and to run the processes across a single system to improve analytics and efficiency, and that has provided an opportunity to the likes of OneStream.</p>
<p>The impact of the pandemic should not be underestimated in this trend, and it was one that OneStream was able to nail because its software can be used across disparate teams and can draw a direct line to helping companies manage their finances better. And unlike a lot of tech companies that raise venture funding, one interesting detail with OneStream is that it has extended its customer base well outside the realm of technology companies and other early adopters. <a href="https://www.onestreamsoftware.com/testimonials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Those using its software</a> include the likes of Fruit of the Loom, McCain (the frozen fries king) and AAA, but also Takeaway.com, the Carlyle Group and many others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic accelerated OneStream’s business given that it was a wake-up call for many companies that had not digitally transformed their key finance processes,&#8221; said Koefoed. &#8220;As a result, we have seen increased demand from companies who were using spreadsheets or legacy CPM applications to manage their financial close, consolidation, reporting, planning and forecasting processes&#8230; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They are better able to keep their finance teams connected and collaborating while physically dispersed. In addition, we have seen many organizations increasing the frequency of their forecasting and scenario modeling from quarterly or monthly to weekly and daily in some cases, especially during the early days of the pandemic when modeling revenue and cash flow was critical.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>For investors, the interest more specifically was how OneStream managed to add more customers away from competitors in the last year.</p>
<p>“<span class="il">OneStream</span>’s platform delivers exceptional customer value,” said Andrew Wynne, a principal at D1 Capital Partners, in a statement. “Management’s intense focus on customer success has enabled <span class="il">OneStream</span> to capture significant market share from incumbents, while posting strong growth in both revenue and customer acquisition. We believe <span class="il">OneStream</span> has both the vision and product required to be a dominant force in its industry.”</p>
<p>Going forward, it sounds like the company will continue to build on what it has already established. That will include more business into Asia Pacific alongside its current operations in North America and Europe, Koefoed said. It will also use its foothold in finance and providing services to the finance department to make inroads into other areas that link closely to money management: money spending and revenue generation, with tools to plan and operate in areas like HR, IT, sales, marketing, supply chain management &#8220;and other areas to ensure alignment and optimal resource allocations,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union may investigate Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">$1BN acquisition</a> of customer service platform Kustomer after concerns were referred to it under EU merger rules.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Commission confirmed it received a request to refer the proposed acquisition from Austria under Article 22 of the EU&#8217;s Merger Regulation &#8212; a mechanism which allows Member States to flag a proposed transaction that&#8217;s not notifiable under national filing thresholds (e.g. because the turnover of one of the companies is too low for a formal notification).</p>
<p>The Commission spokeswoman said the case was notified in Austria on March 31.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Following the receipt of an Article 22 request for referral, the Commission has to transmit the request for referral to other Member States without delay, who will have the right to join the original referral request within 15 working days of being informed by the Commission of the original request,&#8221; she told us, adding: &#8220;Following the expiry of the deadline for other Member States to join the referral, the Commission will have 10 working days to decide whether to accept or reject the referral.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know in a few weeks whether or not the European Commission will take a look at the acquisition &#8212; an option that could see the transaction stalled for months, delaying Facebook&#8217;s plans for integrating Kustomer&#8217;s platform into its empire.</p>
<p>Facebook and Kustomer have been contacted for comment on the development.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s planned purchase of the customer relations management platform was announced last November and quickly raised concerns over what Facebook might do with any personal data held by Kustomer &#8212; which could include sensitive information, given sectors served by the platform include healthcare, government and financial services, among others.</p>
<p>Back in February, the <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Kustomer-regulatory-authorities.pdf">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL) wrote to the Commission and national and EU data protection agencies to raise concerns about the proposed acquisition &#8212; urging scrutiny of the &#8220;data processing consequences&#8221;, and highlighting how Kustomer&#8217;s terms allow it to process user data for very wide-ranging purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook is acquiring this company. The scope of &#8216;improving our Services&#8217; [in Kustomer&#8217;s terms] is already broad, but is likely to grow broader after Kustomer is acquired,&#8221; the ICCL warned. &#8220;&#8216;Our Services&#8217; may, for example, be taken to mean any Facebook services or systems or projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The settled caselaw of the European Court of Justice, and the European data protection board, that &#8216;improving our services&#8217; and similarly vague statements do not qualify as a &#8216;processing purpose&#8217;,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The ICCL also said it had written to Facebook asking for confirmation of the post-acquisition processing purposes for which people&#8217;s data will be used.</p>
<p>Johnny Ryan, senior fellow at the ICCL, confirmed to TechCrunch it has not had any response from Facebook to those questions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also asked Facebook to confirm what it will do with any personal data held on users by Kustomer once it owns the company &#8212; and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>In a separate (recent) episode &#8212; involving Google &#8212; its acquisition of wearable maker Fitbit went through months of competition scrutiny in the EU and was only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">cleared by regional regulators</a> after the tech giant made a number of concessions, including committing not to use Fitbit data for ads for ten years.</p>
<p>Until now Facebook&#8217;s acquisitions have generally flown under regulators&#8217; radar, including, around a decade ago, when it was sewing up the social space by buying up rivals Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Several years later it was forced to pay a fine in the EU over a &#8216;misleading&#8217; filing &#8212; after it combined WhatsApp and Facebook data, despite having told regulators it could not do so.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">so many data scandals now inextricably attached to Facebook</a>, the tech giant is saddled with customer mistrust by default and faces far greater scrutiny of how it operates &#8212; which is now threatening to inject friction into its plans to expand its b2b offering by acquiring a CRM player. So after &#8216;move fast and break things&#8217; Facebook is having to move slower because of its reputation for breaking stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Facebook has now sent this statement, attributed to a company spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This deal will bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in a dynamic and competitive space. More people will benefit from customer service that is faster, richer and available whenever and however they need it. We look forward to demonstrating to regulators that Facebook and Kustomer would offer more choices and better services through this pro-competitive deal.”</p></blockquote>
