										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been about a year and a half since Amazon released the first Echo Buds. I reviewed them when they arrived, and they were, I don’t know, fine, I guess. They were a bit on the cheap side, facing some stiff competition in the category and, honestly, the idea of wearing Alexa on my head still isn’t super exciting to me.</p>
<p>But for a first attempt at the space, they weren’t bad. And now the company’s giving it a second go, with some tweaks to the original formula. Top of the list is a redesign that shrinks them 20% and makes them a bit lighter weight. The stem is smaller, which should make them more comfortable for longer periods, coupled with four ear tip sizes. The headphones are rated IPX4 for sweat and weather resistance.</p>

<p>Amazon has moved on from the predecessor’s Bose noise canceling to its own proprietary tech, which it says can effectively double V1. There’s also an optional case that supports wireless charging via Qi, à la AirPods. The white case, in particular, looks&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/apples-airpods-pro-set-a-pricey-new-standard-for-earbuds/">rather familiar</a>.</p>
<p>That case runs an extra $20 over the $120 asking price for the USB-C case. Though Amazon’s running a limited-time deal to get the standard for $100 and the wireless charging version for $120. They’re also throwing in six months of Amazon Music Unlimited and Audible Plus. The new buds are also available in white. They’re up for preorder today and start shipping in May.</p>

<p>Future software updates will bring a new VIP Filter to the headphones. Introduced on the Echo Frames, the feature lets users filter notifications from select senders. In addition to Alexa, the buds can also be set to access Siri or Google Assistant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Streaming media software maker <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> announced today it has raised a $50 million growth equity round from existing investor Intercap ahead of its planned business expansion into rentals, purchases and subscription content. This is the first financing Plex has taken on since 2014 and is being partly used to purchase shares and options from Plex&#8217;s early seed investors and shareholders from prior acquisitions, and to give the company&#8217;s earliest employees a bit of liquidity. Of the $50 million raised, $15 million will be put to work as new growth capital.</p>
<p>The company declined to disclose its valuation as a result of the funding &#8212; technically Plex&#8217;s Series C &#8212; but says it resulted in a relatively low dilution for its existing investors who have stayed in, including Kleiner Perkins and Nexstar, for example. Meanwhile, some of its earliest investors were able to get a 10x return or greater on their shares.</p>
<p>As part of the round, Intercap chairman and CEO Jason Chapnik joined the board of directors as chairman, and Intercap president James Merkur also joined the board. Including this financing, Plex has raised more than $60 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, Plex has been cautious about fundraising because, as Plex CEO Keith Valory says, &#8220;we really hadn&#8217;t had to.&#8221; That is, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/plex-is-launching-its-own-ad-supported-video-service-starting-with-content-from-warner-bros-tv/">has been profitable</a> on its own.</p>
<p>But things have been changing at Plex in recent years. Though it has always catered to the home media enthusiast with its software for organizing movies, TV, music and photos on users&#8217; home networks, Plex more seriously began to go after the larger market of cord cutters with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/plex-becomes-a-low-cost-diy-streaming-tv-service/">its 2017 launch of a low-cost, DIY streaming TV service</a>. In the years since, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/plex-launches-a-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-in-over-200-countries/">expanded into free, ad-supported streaming</a> and last year took on rivals like ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/plex-launches-a-live-tv-service-with-over-80-free-channels-most-available-worldwide/">own launch of a live TV service</a>, also supported by ads.</p>

<p>Today, Plex now offers more than 20,000 free on-demand movies and shows and over 150 free live TV channels in 193 countries, alongside access to other content, including personal media libraries, streaming music and podcasts.</p>
<p>As it expanded the types of services it offers, it also lowered the barriers to entry for Plex newcomers. Users now no longer have to sign up for an account to access the ad-supported video or <a href="https://www.plex.tv/watch-free-tv/">live linear streaming</a> service, which impacts Plex&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137984" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137984" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="342" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg 3336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=1536,772 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1029 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.49.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;That is much more tailored towards paid marketing &#8212; like getting integrated into the search capabilities for devices like Roku, Fire TV or Vizio, etc. But then, also, using [search engine marketing] and Facebook and other, even on-device paid marketing programs to get people to get in and start watching something,&#8221; says Valory. &#8220;We found that the kind of paid marketing and customer acquisition costs for that business is really efficient. We&#8217;ve been able to get profitable on that marketing investment really, really quickly,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>That model is what prompted Plex to consider raising capital to grow this aspect of its business and expand in new areas, as well.</p>
<p>That included managing subscription content and offering rentals and purchases &#8212; something<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/media-streamer-plex-to-add-subscription-channels-rentals-and-more/"> Plex began to talk about last year</a> as part of its roadmap, saying they could potentially arrive in 2020. But then COVID hit, and though streaming itself grew &#8212; particularly ad-supported video in April through June or July &#8212; some Plex employees were hit harder than others by the pandemic. And Plex also needed more time to ready the infrastructure involved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now preparing to launch these efforts this year, perhaps initially with a video rental marketplace or a subscription aggregator. (Plex says it&#8217;s not sure which will get out of the gate first because both are being built simultaneously.)</p>
<p>With the subscription play, Plex isn&#8217;t looking just at selling subscriptions the way that say, Amazon or Apple do through Prime Video Channels or Apple TV Channels. It&#8217;s also considering deep linking technology to get users to their favorite streaming apps, including those from the big-name brands that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t want to be a part of someone else&#8217;s service. This could position Plex as a competitor to services like <a href="https://reelgood.com/">Reelgood</a>, which today allows users to track what they&#8217;re watching and get recommendations across all their streaming apps, not just within each individual app.</p>
<p>Plex&#8217;s video rental (and maybe purchases) marketplace, meanwhile, will be much like any other, offering users a chance to pay for content they couldn&#8217;t find a way to stream.</p>
<p>Both ideas fit in with Plex&#8217;s larger goal to become a one-stop shop for all your media needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had a fairly audacious mission. You shouldn&#8217;t have to go to 20 different apps to get the content you care about. You should be able to go to one place and we should be able to do all that for you,&#8221; notes Valory.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1920030" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1920030" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1920030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/plex-movies-and-tv-home.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1920030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Plex</p></div></p>
<p>To fuel its growth on both this front and for its ad-supported businesses, Plex plans to use the funds to expand its now 100-person team with investments in marketing and monetization teams, as well as on the development side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, there&#8217;s still way more work to do in terms of amplifying the efforts on our performance and growth marketing and engagement,&#8221; Valory says. &#8220;I mean, the business is growing super fast, so we&#8217;ve done a pretty good job, to date, of building out the muscles to get new users in the pipeline for the AVOD business. There&#8217;s still a ton of work to do there, but a lot of the muscles that we&#8217;re building there will help in terms of the top-of-funnel and increasing engagement for the whole product,&#8221; he adds.</p>

<p>Intercap, which led Plex&#8217;s round, is in it for the long haul &#8212; citing in particular how the fragmentation happening now in the streaming landscape could ultimately be good for Plex&#8217;s own growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Content providers, creators and consumers are all paying the price for the explosion of so many streaming media services and the industry needs a trusted way for the experience to be as enjoyable as possible,&#8221; says Chapnik. &#8220;Plex has always been at the forefront of solving new media challenges and we believe they are primed to solve this problem &#8212; they are the cable company of the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, a startup called <a href="https://upstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upstack</a> that has built a platform to help those businesses evaluate how to grapple with those next steps &#8212; including planning and costing out different options and scenarios, and then ultimately buying solutions &#8212; is announcing financing to do some growth of its own.</p>
<p>The New York startup has picked up funding of $50 million, money that it will be using to continue building out its platform and expanding its services business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming from <a href="https://www.berkshirepartners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkshire Partners</a>, and it&#8217;s being described as an &#8220;initial investment&#8221;. The firm, which makes private equity and late-stage growth investments, typically puts between $100 million and $1 billion in its portfolio companies so this could end up as a bigger number, especially when you consider the size of the market that Upstack is tackling: the cloud and internet infrastructure brokerage industry generates annual revenues &#8220;in excess of $70 billion,&#8221; the company estimates.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re asking about the valuation, but PitchBook notes that the median valuation in its deals is around $211 million. Upstack had previously raised around $35 million.</p>
<p>Upstack today already provides tools to large enterprises, government organizations, and smaller businesses to compare offerings and plan out pricing for different scenarios covering a range of IT areas, including <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">private, p</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ublic and hybrid cloud deployments; data center investments; network connectivity; business continuity and mobile services, and the plan is to bring in more categories to the mix, including unified communications and security.</span></p>
<p>Notably, Upstack itself is profitable and names a lot of customers that themselves are tech companies &#8212; they include Cisco, Accenture, cloud storage company Backblaze, Riverbed and Lumen &#8212; a mark of how digital transformation and planning for it are not necessarily a core competency even of digital businesses, but especially those that are not technology companies. It says it has helped complete over 3,700 IT projects across 1,000 engagements to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstack was founded to bring enterprise-grade advisory services to businesses of all sizes,&#8221; said Christopher Trapp, founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;Berkshire&#8217;s expertise in the data center, connectivity and managed services sectors aligns well with our commitment to enabling and empowering a world-class ecosystem of technology solutions advisors with a platform that delivers higher value to their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The core of the Upstack&#8217;s proposition is a platform that system integrators, or advisors, plus end users themselves, can use to design and compare pricing for different services and solutions. This is an unsung but critical aspect of the ecosystem: We love to hear and write about all the interesting enterprise technology that is being developed, but the truth of the matter is that buying and using that tech is never just a simple click on a &#8220;buy&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Even for smaller organizations, buying tech can be a hugely time-consuming task. It involves evaluating different companies and what they have to offer &#8212; which can differ widely in the same category, and gets more complex when you start to compare different technological approaches to the same problem.</p>
<p>It also includes the task of designing solutions to fit one&#8217;s particular network. And finally, there are the calculations that need to be made to determine the real cost of services once implemented in an organization. It also gives users the ability to present their work, which also forms a critical part of the evaluating and decision-making process. When you think about all of this, it&#8217;s no wonder that so many organizations have opted to follow the &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; school of digital strategy.</p>
<p>As technology has evolved, the concept of digital transformation itself has become more complicated, making tools like Upstack&#8217;s more in demand both by companies and the people they hire to do this work for them. Upstack also employs a group of about 15 advisors &#8212; consultants &#8212; who also provide insight and guidance in the procurement process, and it seems some of the funding will also be used to invest in expanding that team.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the model of balancing technology with human experts is one used by other enterprise startups that are built around the premise of helping businesses procure technology: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/enterprise-cybersecurity-startup-bluevoyant-raises-82-5m-at-a-430m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueVoyant</a>, a security startup that has built a platform to help businesses manage and use different security services, also retains advisors who are experts in that field.)</p>
<p>The advisors are part of the business model: Upstack&#8217;s customers can either pay Upstack a consulting fee to work with its advisors, or Upstack receives a commission from suppliers that a company ends up using, having evaluated and selected them via the Upstack platform.</p>
<p>The company competes with traditional systems integrators and consultants, but it seems that the fact that it has built a tech platform that some of its competitors also use is one reason why it&#8217;s caught the eye of investors, and also seen strong growth.</p>
<p>Indeed, when you consider the breadth of services that a company might use within their infrastructure &#8212; whether it&#8217;s software to run sales or marketing, or AI to run a recommendation for products on a site, or business intelligence or RPA &#8212; it will be interesting to see how and if Upstack considers deeper moves into these areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstack has quickly become a leader in a large, rapidly growing and highly fragmented market,&#8221; said Josh Johnson, principal at Berkshire Partners, in a statement. “Our experience has reinforced the importance of the agent channel to enterprises designing and procuring digital infrastructure. Upstack&#8217;s platform accelerates this digital transformation by helping its advisors better serve their enterprise customers. We look forward to supporting Upstack&#8217;s continued growth through M&amp;A and further investment in the platform.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://outschool.com/#abkn97lfgv">Outschool</a>, a marketplace providing small-group, virtual after-school activities for children has raised a $75 million Series C led by Coatue and Tiger Global Management. TechCrunch first learned of the round from sources familiar with the transaction; the company confirmed the deal to TechCrunch later today.</p>
<p>The new funding values Outschool’s at $1.3 billion, around 4 times higher than its roughly $320 million valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/outschool-newly-profitable-raises-a-45m-series-b-for-virtual-small-group-classes/">set less than a year ago.</a></p>
<p>To date, Outschool has raised $130 million in venture capital to date, inclusive of its new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s valuation growth curve is steep for any startup, let alone an edtech concern that saw the majority of its growth during the pandemic. But while CEO and co-founder Amir Nathoo says his company’s new valuation is partially a reflection of today’s fundraising frenzy, he thinks revenue sustainability is a key factor in his company&#8217;s recent fundraise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wZrfGDde1B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">How is edtech spending its extra capital?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How is edtech spending its extra capital?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/embed/#?secret=wZrfGDde1B" data-secret="wZrfGDde1B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new unicorn’s core product is after school classes for entertainment or supplemental studies, on an ongoing or one-off basis. As the company has grown, ongoing classes have grown from 10% of its business to 50% of its business, implying that the startup is generating more reliable revenue over time.</p>
<p>The change from one-off classes to enduring engagements could be good for the company and its students. On the former, recurring revenue is music to investor ears. On the latter, students need repetition to develop close relationships with a course and a group. Ongoing classes about debate or a weekly zombie dance class makes for a stickier experience.</p>
<p>Nathoo says everyone always asks what the most popular classes are, but said it continues to change since its main clientele &#8211; kids &#8211; have evolving favorites. One week it might be math, the other it might be minecraft and architecture.</p>
<p>Its changing revenue profile helped Outschool generate more than $100 million in bookings in 2020, compared to $6 million in 2019 and just $500,000 in 2017. Nathoo declined to share the company’s expectations for 2021 beyond “projecting to grow aggressively.”</p>
<p>Outschool reached brief positive cash flow last year as a result of massive growth in bookings, but Nathoo shared that that has since changed.</p>
<p>“My goal is to always stay within touching distance of profit,” he said. “But given the fast change in the market, it makes sense to invest aggressively into opportunities that will make sense in the long-term.”</p>
<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nathoo expects to grow Outschool’s staff from 110 people to 200 by the end of the year, with a specific focus on international growth. In 2020, Outschool launched in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK, so hiring will continue there and elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Outschool isn&#8217;t  teachers at the same clip it was at the height of the pandemic in the United States. When the pandemic started, Outschool had 1,000 teachers on its platform. Within months, Outschool grew to host 10,000 teachers, a screening process that the founder explained was resource-heavy but vital. Outschool makes more money if teachers join the platform full-time: teachers pocket 70% of the price they set for classes, while Outschool gets the other 30% of income. But, Nathoo views the platform as more of a supplement to traditional education. Instead of scaling revenue by convincing teachers to come on full-time, the CEO is growing by adding more part-time teachers to the platform.</p>
<p>Similar to how Airbnb created a <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/update-on-the-airbnb-host-endowment-and-our-commitment-to-communities/">host endowment fund</a> to share its returns with the people who made its platform work, Outschool has dedicated 2% of its fundraise to creating a similar program to reward teachers on its platform in the event of liquidity.</p>
<p>One of Outschool&#8217;s most ambitious goals is, ironically, to go in school. While some startups have found success selling to schools amid the pandemic, district sales cycles and tight budgets continue to be a difficult challenge for scaling purposes. Still, the startup wants to make its way into students’ lives through contracts with schools and employers, which could help low income families access the platform. Nathoo says enterprise sales is a small part of its business, but the strategy began just last year as part of COVID-19 response. It is currently piloting its B2B offering with a number of schools.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=LE0dqSlett" data-secret="LE0dqSlett" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Outschool will also consider acquiring early-stage startups focused on direct-to-consumer learning in international markets. While no acquisitions have been made by the startup to date, consolidation in the edtech sector broadly is heating up.</p>
<p>Nathoo stressed that Outschool’s continued growth, even as schools reopen, has de-risked the company from post-pandemic worries.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a big spike of in-person activities because everyone is going to want to do that at once,” he said. “But then we’re going to settle at some more even distribution because the future of education is hybrid.”</p>
<p>He added that Outschool’s ethos around online learning hasn’t changed since conception. The company has never seen opportunity in the for-credit, subject-matter digital education sector, and instead has focused more on supplemental ways to support students after school.</p>
<p>“That’s the piece of the education system that is underserved and that was missing,” he said. “The advantages of online learning will remain in the convenience, the cost, and the variety of what you can get that isn’t always available locally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Hampus Jakobsson, Heidi Lindvall, and Joel Larsson, all well-known players in the European venture ecosystem, began talking about their new firm <a href="https://www.paleblue.vc/#section-0">Pale Blue Dot</a>, they began by looking at the problems with venture capital.</p>
<p>For the three entrepreneurs and investors, whose resumes included co-founding companies and accelerators like The Astonishing Tribe (Jakobsson) and Fast Track Malmö (Lindvall and Larsson) and working as a venture partner at BlueYard Capital (Jakobsson again), the problems were clear.</p>
<p>Their first thesis was that all investment funds should be impact funds, and be taking into account ways to effect positive change; their second thesis was that since all funds should be impact funds, what would be their point of differentiation &#8212; that is, where could they provide the most impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three young investors hit on climate change as the core mission and ran with it.</p>
<p>As it was closing on €53 million ($63.3 million) last year, the firm also made its first investments in <a href="https://www.phytoformlabs.com/">Phytoform</a>, a London headquartered company creating new crops using computational biology and synbio; <a href="https://www.usepatch.com/">Patch</a>, a San Francisco-based carbon-offsetting platform that finances both traditional and frontier “carbon sequestration” methods; and <a href="http://www.20tree.ai/">20tree.ai</a>, an Amsterdam-based startup, using machine learning and satellite data to understand trees to lower the risk of forest fires and power outages.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XlsrsctA8e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/pale-blue-dot/">Pale Blue Dot is a new early-stage fund backing &#8216;climate-focused&#8217; startups in Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pale Blue Dot is a new early-stage fund backing &#8216;climate-focused&#8217; startups in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/pale-blue-dot/embed/#?secret=XlsrsctA8e" data-secret="XlsrsctA8e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now they&#8217;ve raised another €34 million and seven more investments on their path to doing between 30 and 35 deals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These investments primarily focus on Europe and include <a href="https://www.veat.se/">Veat</a>, a European vegetarian prepared meal company; <a href="https://madefrom.io/">Madefrom</a>, a still-in-stealth company angling to make everyday products more sustainable; <a href="https://www.hackyourcloset.com/">HackYourCloset</a>, a clothing rental company leveraging fast fashion to avoid landfilling clothes; <a href="https://hier.in/">Hier</a>, a fresh food delivery service; <a href="https://www.cirplus.com/en">Cirplus</a>, a marketplace for recycled plastics trading; and <a href="https://www.overstory.ai/">Overstory</a>, which aims to prevent wildfires by giving utilities a view into vegetation around their assets. </span></p>
<p>The team expects to be primarily focused on Europe, with a few opportunistic investments in the U.S., and intends to invest in companies that are looking to change systems rather than directly affect consumer behavior. For instance, a Pale Blue Dot investment likely wouldn&#8217;t include e-commerce filters for more sustainable shopping, but potentially could include investments in sustainable consumer products companies.</p>
<p>The size of the firm&#8217;s commitments will range up to €1 million and will look to commit to a lot of investments. That&#8217;s by design, said Jakobsson. &#8220;Climate is so many different fields that we didn&#8217;t want to do 50% of the fund in food or 50% of the fund in materials,&#8221; he said. Also, the founders know their skillsets, which are primarily helping early stage entrepreneurs scale and making the right connections to other investors that can add value.</p>
<p>&#8220;In every deal we&#8217;ve gotten in co-investors that add particular, amazing, value while we still try to be the shepherds and managers and sherpas,&#8221; Jakobsson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re the ones that are going to protect the founder from the hell-rain of investor opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another point of differentiation for the firm are its limited partners. Jakobsson said they rejected capital from oil companies in favor of founders and investors from the tech community that could add value. These include <a href="https://primamateria.com/">Prima Materia</a>, the investment vehicle for Spotify founder Daniel Ek; the founders of Supercell, Zendesk, TransferWise and DeliveryHero are also backing the firm. So too, is Albert Wenger, a managing partner at <a href="https://www.usv.com/people/albert-wenger/">Union Square Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The goal, simply, is to be the best early stage climate fund in Europe.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to be <em>the</em> European climate fund,&#8221; Lindvall said. &#8220;This is where we can make most of the difference.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.connectedcannabisco.com">Connected Cannabis Co.</a> was founded in 2009 and has since grown to become a leading cultivator of designer cannabis strains. Today, the company announced $30 million in debt and equity financing. This comes after the company raised a $25 million Series A in 2019. The new round was led by existing investors including Navy Capital and One Tower Group. Emerald Park Capital, an affiliate of Bryant Park Capital, and Presidio View Capital also participated.</p>
<p>Currently, Connected Cannabis Co. operates cultivation and retail facilities in California and Arizona. With the additional financing, it intends to expand elsewhere. The company says it plans on focusing on states with robust cannabis cultures and promising outlook for growth such as Nevada and Michigan.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to bring Emerald Park Capital and Presidio into the Connected family and welcome back our long-term partners that have supported our company’s mission from the very beginning,” said Sam Ghods, CEO of Connected. “We are steadfast in our development of new, best-in-class genetics and our production of top-quality flower that has resulted in impressive growth and unwavering customer loyalty. That same commitment and quality that we’ve prided ourselves on from day one will stay with us as we enter additional states. We look forward to bringing our true product and brand to consumers in new markets &#8211; that is our highest priority every time we look at expansion.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Connected Cannabis is among a growing number of cannabis-focused companies amassing a war chest ahead of expanding outside of select regions. As more states in the United States legalize cannabis, more companies are exploring expansion options. Strict federal regulations often slow the process and make it cumbersome for cultivators like Connected to operate in different states, which often have different regulations and federal law prohibits interstate commerce.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis is easy. The plant is hardy is hearty and forgiving. Growing cannabis at scale is anything but hearty and forgiving, which is why Connected turned to additional funding to fuel its national growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer volume of people migrating to Austin from all over the country, but particularly from the San Francisco Bay Area, has been making headlines for a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One result of this continued migration is a steady surge in housing prices due to increased demand and low inventory that </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/02/25/abor-report-austin-housing-inventory-almost-zero.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped to nearly zero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year. Now, </span><a href="https://www.homebound.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Santa Rosa, California-based tech-enabled homebuilding startup, is entering the Austin market with the goal of helping ease some of the pain felt in the city by offering an alternative to buying existing homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound has raised about $73 million over the years from the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Ventures, Fifth Wall, Khosla, Sound Ventures, Atomic and Thrive Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It raised </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/homebound-a-tech-enabled-general-contractor-raises-35m-to-rebuild-after-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $35 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last April and then closed on a $20 million convertible note late last year. CEO Nikki Pechet and Atomic managing partner </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jack-abraham"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Abraham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded the company in 2017 after Abraham lost his home to wildfires.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially serving as a virtual general contractor, Homebound combines technology and a network for “vetted” and licensed building “experts” to manage the new home construction from the design phase to completion. The startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed tools to track and manage hundreds of unique tasks associated with building a home.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="f3siV0jcPT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">This is a good time to start a proptech company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This is a good time to start a proptech company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/embed/#?secret=f3siV0jcPT" data-secret="f3siV0jcPT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Homebound has been focused on helping homeowners navigate the challenges and complexities of rebuilding after wildfires in California. But this month, Homebound will be expanding to Austin, its first non-disaster market, with the goal of taking learnings from those rebuilds and applying the same “streamlined, tech-enabled building process” to make custom homebuilding an option for local homeowners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Homebound&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Nikki Pechet, to learn more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Homebound, she said, the company is out to serve as a “next gen” homebuilder to make it possible “for anyone, anywhere to build a home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin’s housing market is definitely overheated, with homes going 10-30% above asking in some cases (I should know, I live here).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Homeowners have been reaching out to us from across the country asking us to come to their market,” Pechet said. “We’re already seeing Austin grow faster than any of our other markets did in their early days. It’s going to be a huge market for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a model Pechet envisions replicating in other cities with similar housing supply issues such as Miami, Tampa, Raleigh and Charlotte.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just the start,” Pechet said. “We’re taking the platform to markets across the country to help exactly with this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company starts by helping a potential homeowner identify land they want to build on, or help them find a lot among the inventory Homebound has already built up. From there, it can help with everything from architectural plans to design to actual construction via its platform. Homebound offers a set of plans for people to choose from, with varying levels of customization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building costs for a typical single-family home in the Austin area will start around $300,000 depending on the size, complexity of house, lot size and location. That does not include land cost. Some people are opting to build second units on existing properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In most cases, people can build a new home for less than they can pay for an existing home just because of the dynamics,” Pechet said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">survey</a> European founders and investors in cities outside the major European capitals.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will ask entrepreneurs in these cities to talk about their ecosystems, in their own words. For this survey we are interested in startup hubs in England and Wales. (Scotland will follow, and Northern Ireland is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/putting-belfast-on-the-techcrunch-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>So this is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put your cities on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re like to hear from founders and investors. We are particularly interested in hearing from <strong>diverse</strong> founders and investors. These are our humble suggestions for the cities we&#8217;d most like to hear from:</p>
<p>Birmingham<br />
Brighton<br />
Bristol &amp; Bath<br />
Cambridge<br />
Cardiff<br />
Liverpool<br />
Manchester<br />
Newcastle<br />
Oxford<br />
Reading and Thames valley<br />
York</p>
<p><strong>If you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of the above cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out the survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The more founders/investors we hear from in a particular city, the more likely it is that city will be featured in TechCrunch.</p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Offering a respite from processed foods for the richest 20% of Americans, <a href="https://simplefeast.com/us">Simple Feast</a> has landed on U.S. shores with a mission to expand its presence on the back of $45 million in financing from investors.</p>
<p>The European startup is looking to take a page from the shouty LIVEKINDLY Collective playbook and take on the U.S. market with gourmet prepared meals that come with a gourmet price tag and a mission to make Americans eat less meat by proffering more tasty and delicious vegetarian options.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strategy that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/livekindly-screams-its-way-to-the-top-of-new-plant-brands-with-the-close-of-a-335-million-round/">netted LIVEKINDLY Collective&#8217;s business $335 million</a> in a recent round of funding, making it one of the most well capitalized new entrants in the vegetarian food brand category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LIVEKINDLY screams its way to the top of new plant brands with the close of a $335 million round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/livekindly-screams-its-way-to-the-top-of-new-plant-brands-with-the-close-of-a-335-million-round/embed/#?secret=XFeOl15a0e" data-secret="XFeOl15a0e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a general health problem that&#8217;s coming mostly from what we put in our mouth,&#8221; said Jakob Jønck, the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive.</p>
<p>For folks in the U.S. who can afford it, Simple Feast is offering packaged meal kits with menus developed by chefs from some of the world&#8217;s highest end restaurants &#8212; place like French Laundry in California or Noma in Norway, where meals can run roughly $350 per-person.</p>
<p>A selection of three prepared meals for two-to-three people will run customers around $98 per-week and for a family of four or five that number jumps to $159 per-week.</p>
<p>Simple Feast&#8217;s foray into the US market represents just a small portion of the company&#8217;s total offerings. In the Nordic region the company offers about 30 different products all targeting people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat.</p>
<p>Investors certainly love the company&#8217;s offering, because, as Jønck says, the products probably represent the highest margin in the meal kit category.</p>
<p>Those financiers include firms like the European venture capitalists Balderton Capital and Kinnevik, and New York-based 14W.</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s customers, they&#8217;re mostly moms with kids whose income puts them in the top 20% of the population. While they may be far more wealthy than the hoi polloi, Jønck said they still suffer from exposure to the worst aspects of America&#8217;s industrial food machine &#8212; highly processed foods that are causing an explosion in chronic health conditions like diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>Data from places like the Rand Institute indicate that in America, the burden of insufficient nutrition and the chronic conditions that stem from that are disproportionately affecting low income and middle income families.</p>
<p>Health is a problem in the U.S. with $794 billion per year estimated to be lost in productivity between 2016 and 2030. <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170817.061561/full/">An article from HealthAffairs</a> cited research from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies estimates stating that <a href="http://jointcenter.org/sites/default/files/Economic%20Burden%20of%20Health%20Inequalities%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health inequities and premature death cost the US economy $309.3 billion a year</a>.</p>
<p>However, these costs are primarily born by the poorest Americans, particularly minorities. &#8220;People of color <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face higher rates of diabetes, obesity, stroke, heart disease, and cancer</a> than whites,&#8221; the HealthAffairs article says.</p>
<p>Simple Feast is working to correct that, says Jønck. The company&#8217;s European packaged prepared meals available in retail stores cost around $15, he said, and the company will offer salaries far above the minimum wage in the U.S. to do its part in ameliorating some of the wealth disparity in the country.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a general play on an industry that needs to change for the ground up. This system needs to change,&#8221; Jønck said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://slicelife.com">Slice</a>, a startup that helps independent pizzerias build an online business, has raised another $40 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Cross Creek, with participation from KKR, GGV Capital and Primary Ventures, as well as Twitter&#8217;s former CEO Dick Costolo and former COO Adam Bain (through their firm 01 Advisors).</p>
<p>Last spring, the startup announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/slice-series-c/">a $43 million Series C</a>. Why not raise more money this time? Founder and CEO Ilir Sela described this as &#8220;a quick round&#8221; to get Costolo and Bain  on-board as investors. He also suggested there may be additional fundraising conversations in the not-too-distant future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Slice has emerged as the leader in powering these types of small businesses that have been serving our communities for decades,” Bain said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Ilir and the incredible team at Slice to marry our significant operating and business-scaling experience with Slice&#8217;s focus on enabling economic growth in this category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slice has built a mobile app and website for ordering from local pizzerias, but it also provides tools so they can build their own websites, run marketing campaigns, improve their search engine optimization and more. Slice only charges those pizzerias a fixed $2.25 per order, and last fall it even <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201028005373/en/Slice-Becomes-First-to-Remove-Fees-to-Shops-on-Orders-Under-10-Challenges-All-Online-Ordering-Services-to-Create-Fairer-Fee-Structures">removed the fee for orders under $10</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AzieqMbeBS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/slice-series-c/">Slice, an online ordering and marketing platform for pizzerias, raises $43M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slice, an online ordering and marketing platform for pizzerias, raises $43M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/slice-series-c/embed/#?secret=AzieqMbeBS" data-secret="AzieqMbeBS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company continues to expand its products and services with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/slice-is-launching-a-point-of-sale-system-for-pizzerias/">the recent launch of a point-of-sale system for pizzerias called Slice Register</a>, as well as a cross-pizzeria loyalty program called Slice Rewards.</p>
<p>Some of this might sound a bit niche — a POS system, just for pizzerias? — but when I brought this up with Sela, he replied, &#8220;I love it when people say that, because then they continue to stay out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slice already has 15,000 pizzerias on the platform, with plans to increase that number to 20,000 at the end of the year. He added that although the current addressable market consists of 57,000 independent and small chain U.S. shops, with <a href="https://www.accelerate.slicelife.com">the Slice Accelerate program </a>(where the startup provides select pizzerias with $15,000 worth of technology and services) &#8220;there could be 100,000 in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Accelerate, we’re taking inefficient pizza shops who are predominantly offline and helping them realize their vision for their brand,&#8221; he continued. That might mean improving an existing location, or it might mean launching new ones. In fact, he said the new program has already helped to revamp <a href="https://slicelife.com/restaurants/ny/staten-island/10305/pizza-mia-staten-island/menu">Pizza Mia in Staten Island</a> and will work with Crown Heights-based <a href="https://slicelife.com/restaurants/ny/brooklyn/11225/billy-s-pizza-pasta/menu">Billy&#8217;s Pizza &amp; Pasta</a> to open a second location.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely think that long term, there’s a big question whether our very unique model could be applied to other verticals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it can, but it would be a mistake to move into those verticals today, because of the opportunity that it exists in pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a>, the end-to-end encrypted messaging app and service, has raised a $21 million Series B funding round led by UVC Partners. As the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/messaging-app-wire-confirms-8-2m-raise-responds-to-privacy-concerns-after-moving-holding-company-to-the-us/">said</a> a couple of years ago, the company is focusing on the enterprise market more than ever.</p>
<p>While Wire started as a consumer app, it never managed to attract hundreds of millions of customers like other messaging apps. That doesn’t mean that Wire is a bad product.</p>
<p>The app lets you securely talk with other people using text messages, photos, videos and voice messages. You can also start a video call and send files with other users. Wire supports both one-to-one conversations as well as rooms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default, which means that the company can’t decrypt your conversations, can’t hand them over to a court or can’t expose your conversations to a potential hacker. You can also view the source code <a href="https://github.com/wireapp">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/messaging-app-wire-confirms-8-2m-raise-responds-to-privacy-concerns-after-moving-holding-company-to-the-us/">told TechCrunch</a> that it would open a holding company in the U.S. to raise some funding. The idea was to double down on enterprise customers to find a clear path toward profitability. And this focus hasn’t changed since then.</p>
<p>“If I think back on the evolution of the business &#8211; three years ago we had zero revenue and zero customers &#8211; whereas today we’re announcing a B round and we have clearly established a well-recognised enterprise brand amongst the likes of Gartner, which is one of the things I am extremely proud of,” Wire’s CEO Morten Brogger told me.</p>
<p>“I also think that with the focus on a revenue-generating, enterprise business, we avoid situations like WhatsApp, where the only model you can ultimately turn to is monetising data,” he added.</p>
<p>And it seems to be working well when it comes to revenue growth. Right now, Wire has 1,800 customers. The number of customers has increased by almost 50% over the past year.</p>
<p>The company focuses on large customers, such as big corporations and government customers with a ton of potential users. Five G7 governments are currently using Wire. Overall, revenue has tripled in 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to working on Messaging Layer Security (MLS), Wire has been focused on improving conference calls and real-time interactions. The company believes messaging apps and real-time collaboration apps are slowly converging. And the startup wants to offer a service that works well across various scenarios.</p>
<p>You can also expect more end-to-end encrypted services in the collaboration space. Wire is still relatively small with 90 employees, which means it has room to grow and iterate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stndenergy.com/">Standard Energy</a>, a vanadium ion battery developer, announced today it has raised a $8.9 million Series C from SoftBank Ventures Asia. The South Korea-based company says its batteries’ advantages over lithium ion include less risk of ignition and the ease of sourcing vanadium. The latter is an important selling point, as electric vehicle makers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/the-us-is-facing-a-lithium-ion-battery-shortage-with-ev-growth.html">face a potential shortage of lithium ion batteries</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of serving as a replacement for lithium ion batteries, however, Standard Energy chief executive officer Bu Gi Kim said they complement each other. Vanadium ion batteries have high energy, performance and safety, but they are not as compact as lithium ion batteries.</p>
<p>Lithium ion batteries will continue to be used in hardware that needs to be mobile, such as electric vehicles or consumer devices like smartphones, but vanadium ion batteries are suited to “stationary” customers, like wind and solar power plants or ultra-fast charging stations for electric vehicles (Kim said Standard Energy is scheduled to ship its batteries to an ultra-fast charging station in Seoul soon).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founded in 2013 by researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Standard Energy has raised a total of $22.5 million. One of its main potential customers is the energy storage systems (ESS) sector, which the company says is expected to grow from $8 billion to $35 billion in the next five years.</p>
<p>“A large number of renewable energy projects have slowed or even stopped in many places due to the unstable battery performance of lithium ion. VIB cannot be as compact as lithium ion. However, ESS projects or solutions including renewable energy plants provide enough space for our products to be integrated into their systems,” said Kim.</p>
<p>Standard Energy has already performed a total of over one million battery testing hours, including in a lab, at a certified battery performance test site and in actual operations. Kim said the company is confident its performance data will convince customers to adopt vanadium ion batteries.</p>
<p>In a press statement, SoftBank Ventures Asia senior partner Daniel Kang said, “The existing ESS market was in a state of imbalance due to the rapidly growing demand, and safety and efficiency issues of products. Standard Energy is expected to create new standards for the global ESS market through its innovative material and design technology with massive manufacturing capabilities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a continent with such stark inequality, Africa has seen limited innovation to increase access to healthcare and reduce healthcare delivery costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, there has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment in traditional care models despite the overwhelming evidence of inefficiency and escalating costs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also laid these problems bare, exposing the vulnerabilities of the continent&#8217;s healthcare system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health tech startup <a href="https://www.quromedical.co.za/">Quro Medical</a> is trying to scale alternative models for African healthcare starting from its home country, South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which provides services to manage ill patients in the comfort of their homes, is emerging from stealth to announce the close of its $1.1 million round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenya-based Enza Capital and South African VC firm Mohau Equity Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quro Medical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/dr-vuyane-mhlomi-mbchb-mba-dphil-b4a31537"> Dr Vuyane Mhlomi</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/zikho-pali-b2254b68">Zikho Pali</a> and <a href="https://jrmcornish.github.io/">Rob Cornish</a> in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Mhlomi understood the pressing need for South African healthcare innovation from his own experience before and after he became a doctor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that hospitals in Africa experience excessive demands, which places strain on bed capacity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the same time, it hinders effective patient treatment and recovery. Raised in Cape Town by his parents, Mhlomi experienced this firsthand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His parents suffered from chronic health conditions and he had to spend hours in clinics and hospitals waiting to see doctors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, an opportunity to study medicine took him to the University of Oxford. Upon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completion, he returned to South Africa where he knew the problem he faced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was one to solve, hence Quro Medical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were connected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our belief that the private healthcare sector can and should be doing more to shoulder the burden of healthcare provision in this country and on the continent generally,&#8221; Mhlomi told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These escalating costs are the primary barrier to accessing healthcare in the private sector, leaving an overwhelming burden on our public health system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO argues that acute patient care at home leads to better clinical outcomes and improved patient experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the principle on which Quro Medical is established. In the long run, it wants to build the largest virtual hospital ward in Africa, with superior clinical outcomes to conventional care at a lower cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2138225 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?w=680" alt="Quro Medical" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png 1311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-142.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike hospitals, getting healthcare at home can feel safer, which is an extra proposition for Quro Medical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to COO Pali, apart from hospitals&#8217; high costs, patients are also at risk of getting hospital-acquired infections and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while it might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">appear that Quro Medical is offering the same old traditional home care with a mix of telemedicine service, that&#8217;s not precisely the case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pali says the company incorporates clinical data and remote healthcare monitoring to provide real-time, data-driven clinical interventions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are admitted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the company&#8217;s care in lieu of a general ward hospital admission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Quro Medical makes revenue from filing a claim with medical aid and insurance companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via reimbursement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The healthtech startup also collects out-of-pocket payments from patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic reinforced the company&#8217;s importance in offering remote patient monitoring services, a significant aspect of its business that garnered a check from Enza Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As our collective healthcare systems struggle to care for patients beyond the walls of a hospital, which we’ve seen exacerbated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote patient monitoring and healthcare delivery will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">undoubtedly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> form a core part of the lasting solution,” said <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/mikemompi">Mike Mompi</a>, partner and CEO at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, this period has also seen health tech startups offering out-of-hospital services struggle to have their services reimbursed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So how has Quro fared? Pretty well,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims to successfully convert most of its major medical schemes (health insurance) in South Africa as clients. They a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccount for more than 90% of the total medical scheme market in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quro Medical has grown to work with about 150 doctors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mhlomi believes his company is a first mover in Africa, meaning that he expects other players&#8217; arrival in line with the trends in other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company that has grown to work with 150 doctors now has plans to accelerate its hospital-at-home services and scale its operations across the country to meet its growing client base&#8217;s demands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also wants to attract and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talent and extend into other African markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment for Mohau Equity Partners, CEO <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/penny-moumakwa-31b5a8169">Dr Penny Moumakwa</a> said, “We are very excited to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Quro, they are a dynamic management team, building out a global medical solution, that will showcase the ability of entrepreneurs on the African continent in advanced digital healthcare.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk famously said any company relying on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/anyone-relying-on-lidar-is-doomed-elon-musk-says/">lidar is &#8220;doomed.&#8221;</a> Tesla instead believes automated driving functions are built on visual recognition and is even working to remove the radar. China&#8217;s Xpeng begs to differ.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Xpeng is one of China&#8217;s most celebrated electric vehicle startups and went public when it was just six years old. Like Tesla, Xpeng sees automation as an integral part of its strategy; unlike the American giant, Xpeng uses a combination of radar, cameras, high-precision maps powered by Alibaba, localization systems developed in-house, and most recently, lidar to detect and predict road conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidar will provide the 3D drivable space and precise depth estimation to small moving obstacles even like kids and pets, and obviously, other pedestrians and the motorbikes which are a nightmare for anybody who&#8217;s working on driving,&#8221; Xinzhou Wu, who oversees Xpeng&#8217;s autonomous driving R&amp;D center, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;On top of that, we have the usual radar which gives you location and speed. Then you have the camera which has very rich, basic semantic information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xpeng is adding lidar to its mass-produced EV model P5, which will begin delivering in the second half of this year. The car, a family sedan, will later be able to drive from point A to B based on a navigation route set by the driver on highways and certain urban roads in China that are covered by Alibaba&#8217;s maps. An older model without lidar already enables assisted driving on highways.</p>
<p>The system, called Navigation Guided Pilot, is benchmarked against Tesla&#8217;s Navigate On Autopilot, said Wu. It can, for example, automatically change lanes, enter or exit ramps, overtake other vehicles, and maneuver another car&#8217;s sudden cut-in, a common sight in China&#8217;s complex road conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is super hard compared to the highway but with lidar and precise perception capability, we will have essentially three layers of redundancy for sensing,&#8221; said Wu.</p>
<p>By definition, NGP is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) as drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel and take control at any time (Chinese laws don&#8217;t allow drivers to be hands-off on the road). The carmaker’s ambition is to remove the driver, that is, reach Level 4 autonomy two to four years from now, but real-life implementation will hinge on regulations, said Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not worried about that too much. I understand the Chinese government is actually the most flexible in terms of technology regulation.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The lidar camp</h2>
<p>Musk&#8217;s disdain for lidar stems from the high costs of the remote sensing method that uses lasers. In the early days, a lidar unit spinning on top of a robotaxi could cost as much as $100,000, said Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, [the cost] is at least two orders low,&#8221; said Wu. After 13 years with Qualcomm in the U.S., Wu joined Xpeng in late 2018 to work on automating the company&#8217;s electric cars. He currently leads a core autonomous driving R&amp;D team of 500 staff and said the force will double in headcount by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our next vehicle is targeting the economy class. I would say it&#8217;s mid-range in terms of price,&#8221; he said, referring to the firm&#8217;s new lidar-powered sedan.</p>
<p>The lidar sensors powering Xpeng come from Livox, a firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">touting more affordable lidar</a> and an affiliate of DJI, the Shenzhen-based drone giant. Xpeng&#8217;s headquarters is in the adjacent city of Guangzhou about 1.5 hours&#8217; drive away.</p>

<p>Xpeng isn&#8217;t the only one embracing lidar. Nio, a Chinese rival to Xpeng targeting a more premium market, <a href="https://www.nio.com/news/nio-launches-first-autonomous-driving-model-et7">unveiled a lidar-powered car</a> in January but the model won&#8217;t start production until 2022. Arcfox, a new EV brand of Chinese state-owned carmaker BAIC, recently said it would be launching an electric car equipped with Huawei&#8217;s lidar.</p>
<p>Musk recently hinted that Tesla may<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380606694816800768"> remove radar from production</a> outright as it inches closer to pure vision based on camera and machine learning. The billionaire founder isn&#8217;t particularly a fan of Xpeng, which he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329806748375527430">alleged</a> owned a copy of Tesla&#8217;s old source code.</p>
<p>In 2019, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Cao Guangzhi alleging that the former Tesla engineer stole trade secrets and brought them to Xpeng. XPeng has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Cao no longer works at Xpeng.</p>
<h2>Supply challenges</h2>
<p>While Livox claims to be an independent entity &#8220;incubated&#8221; by DJI, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">a source told TechCrunch previously</a> that it is just a &#8220;team within DJI&#8221; positioned as a separate company. The intention to distance from DJI comes as no one&#8217;s surprise as the drone maker is on the U.S. government&#8217;s Entity List, which has cut key suppliers off from a multitude of Chinese tech firms including Huawei.</p>
<p>Other critical parts that Xpeng uses include NVIDIA&#8217;s Xavier system-on-the-chip computing platform and Bosch&#8217;s iBooster brake system. Globally, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">ongoing semiconductor shortage</a> is pushing auto executives to ponder over future scenarios where self-driving cars become even more dependent on chips.</p>
<p>Xpeng is well aware of supply chain risks. &#8220;Basically, safety is very important,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than the tension between countries around the world right now. Covid-19 is also creating a lot of issues for some of the suppliers, so having redundancy in the suppliers is some strategy we are looking very closely at.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Taking on robotaxis</h2>
<p>Xpeng could have easily tapped the flurry of autonomous driving solution providers in China, including Pony.ai and WeRide in its backyard Guangzhou. Instead, Xpeng becomes their competitor, working on automation in-house and pledges to outrival the artificial intelligence startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;The availability of massive computing for cars at affordable costs and the fast dropping price of lidar is making the two camps really the same,&#8221; Wu said of the dynamics between EV makers and robotaxi startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The robotaxi companies] have to work very hard to find a path to a mass-production vehicle. If they don&#8217;t do that, two years from now, they will find the technology is already available in mass production and their value become will become much less than today&#8217;s,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how to mass-produce a technology up to the safety requirement and the quarantine required of the auto industry. This is a super high bar for anybody wanting to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xpeng has no plans of going visual-only. Options of automotive technologies like lidar are becoming cheaper and more abundant, so &#8220;why do we have to bind our hands right now and say camera only?&#8221; Wu asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of respect for Elon and his company. We wish them all the best. But we will, as Xiaopeng [founder of Xpeng] said in one of his famous speeches, compete in China and hopefully in the rest of the world as well with different technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>5G, coupled with cloud computing and cabin intelligence, will accelerate Xpeng&#8217;s path to achieve full automation, though Wu couldn&#8217;t share much detail on how 5G is used. When unmanned driving is viable, Xpeng will explore &#8220;a lot of exciting features&#8221; that go into a car when the driver&#8217;s hands are freed. Xpeng&#8217;s electric SUV is already available in Norway, and the company is looking to further expand globally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Ho Chi Minh City, <a href="https://docosan.com/">Docosan</a> helps patients avoid long waits by letting them search and book doctors through its app. The company announced today it has raised more than $1 million in seed funding, which is claims is one of the largest seed rounds ever for a Vietnamese healthtech startup. The investment was led by AppWorks, the Taiwan-based early-stage investor and accelerator program, with participation from David Ma and Huat Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, the app has been used by about 50,000 patients for bookings and now has more than 300 individual healthcare providers, ranging from small family pediatric clinics to neurosurgeons at large private hospitals, co-founder and chief executive officer Beth Ann Lopez told TechCrunch. Providers are vetted before being added to the platform and have on average 18 years of clinical experience.</p>
<p>Lopez said advance doctor bookings aren’t the norm in Vietnam. Instead, people who use private healthcare providers have to “choose between over 30,000 private hospitals and clinics spread across the hospital with huge variations in price and quality. This is why people use word of mouth recommendations from their family and friends to choose a healthcare provider. Then they show up at a hospital or clinic and wait in line, sometimes for hours.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Docosan’s users can filter providers with criteria like location and specialty, and see pricing information and verified customer reviews. It recently added online payment features and insurance integrations. The company, which took part in Harvard’s Launch Lab X plans to launch telehealth and pharmacy services as well.</p>
<p>For healthcare providers on the app, Docosan provides software to manage bookings and ease wait times, a key selling point during the COVID-19 pandemic because many people are reluctant to sit in crowded waiting rooms. Lopez said another benefit is reducing the number of marketing and adminstrative tasks doctors have to do, allowing them to spend more time with patients.</p>
<p>The startup plans to expand into other countries. “Docosan is a solution that works well anywhere with a large, fragmented private healthcare system,” said Lopez. “We would all benefit from a world in which it’s as easy to find a great doctor as it is a book a Grab taxi.”</p>
<p>In press statement, AppWorks partner Andy Tsai said, “We noticed Docosan’s potential early on because of its participation in the AppWorks Accelerator. Docosan’s founders demonstrated strong experience and dedication to the healthcare issues in the region. We are proud to be supporting Docosan’s vision of better healthcare access for all.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a relatively quiet couple of months from Oculus on the software front, Facebook&#8217;s VR unit is sharing some details on new functionality coming to its Quest 2 standalone headset.</p>
<p>The features, which include wireless Oculus Link support, &#8220;Infinite Office&#8221; functionality and upcoming 120hz support will be rolling out in the Quest 2&#8217;s upcoming v28 software update. There&#8217;s no exact word on when that update is coming but the language in the blog seems to intimate that the rollout is imminent.</p>
<p>The big addition here is a wireless version of Oculus Link which will allow Quest 2 users to stream content from their PCs directly to their standalone headsets, enabling more graphics-intensive titles that were previously only available on the now pretty much defunct Rift platform. Air Link is a feature that will enable users to ditch the tethered experience of Oculus Link, though many users have been relying on third-party software to do this already, utilizing <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2017050365004772/?locale=en_US">Virtual Desktop</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It appears this upgrade is only coming to Quest 2 users in a new experimental mode, but not owners of the original Quest headset. Users will need to update the Oculus software on both their Quest 2 and PC to the v28 version in order to use this feature.</p>
<p>Accompanying the release of Air Link in this update is new features coming to &#8220;Infinite Office&#8221; a VR office play that aims to bring your keyboard and mouse into VR and allow users to engage with desktop-style software. Facebook debuted it back at their VR-focused Facebook Connect conference, but they haven&#8217;t said much about it since.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s updates include added keyboard support that not only allows users to link their device but see it inside VR, this support is limited to a single model from a single manufacturer (the Logitech K830) but Facebook says they&#8217;ll be adding support down the road to other keyboards. Users with this keyboard will be able to see outlines of their hands as well as a rendering of the keyboard in its real position, enabling users to accurately type (theoretically). Infinite Office will also allow users to designate where their real world desk is, a feature that will likely help users orient themselves. Even with a keyboard, there&#8217;s not much users can do at the moment beyond accessing the Oculus Browser it seems.</p>
<p>Lastly, Oculus is allowing developers to sample out 120hz frame rate support for their titles. Facebook says that there isn&#8217;t actually anything available with that frame rate yet, not even system software, but that support is here for developers in an experimental fashion.</p>
<p>Oculus says the new software update will be rolling out &#8220;gradually&#8221; to users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A court in Houston has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20614804-houston-court-order-re-hafnium">authorized</a> an FBI operation to &#8220;copy and remove&#8221; backdoors from hundreds of Microsoft Exchange email servers in the United States, months after hackers used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">four previously undiscovered vulnerabilities</a> to attack thousands of networks.</p>
<p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft">announced the operation</a> on Tuesday, which it described as &#8220;successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft discovered a new China state-sponsored hacking group — Hafnium — targeting Exchange servers run from company networks. The four vulnerabilities when chained together allowed the hackers to break into a vulnerable Exchange server and steal its contents. Microsoft fixed the vulnerabilities but the patches did not close the backdoors from the servers that had already been breached. Within days, other hacking groups began hitting vulnerable servers with the same flaws to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">deploy ransomware</a>.</p>
<p>The number of infected servers dropped as patches were applied. But hundreds of Exchange servers remained vulnerable because the backdoors are difficult to find and eliminate, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This operation removed one early hacking group’s remaining web shells which could have been used to maintain and escalate persistent, unauthorized access to U.S. networks,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The FBI conducted the removal by issuing a command through the web shell to the server, which was designed to cause the server to delete only the web shell (identified by its unique file path).&#8221;</p>

<p>The FBI said it&#8217;s attempting to inform owners via email of servers from which it removed the backdoors.</p>
<p>Assistant attorney general John C. Demers said the operation &#8220;demonstrates the Department’s commitment to disrupt hacking activity using all of our legal tools, not just prosecutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department also said the operation only removed the backdoors, but did not patch the vulnerabilities exploited by the hackers to begin with or remove any malware left behind.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed this is the first known case of the FBI effectively cleaning up private networks following a cyberattack. In 2016, the Supreme Court moved to allow U.S. judges to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/supreme-court-moves-to-expand-fbis-hacking-authority/">issue search and seizure warrants</a> outside of their district. Critics opposed the move at the time, fearing the FBI could ask a friendly court to authorized cyber-operations for anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Other countries, like France, have used similar powers before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/01/police-botnet-takedown-infections/">to hijack a botnet</a> and remotely shutting it down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify wants to have a bigger presence in your car, Apple hints at iPad-centric announcements and Microsoft&#8217;s new Surface Laptop goes on sale. This is your Daily Crunch for April 13, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Spotify unveils an in-car entertainment system</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spotify-launches-an-in-car-entertainment-system-car-thing/">Spotify&#8217;s new device</a> is the oddly (but memorably!) named Car Thing. While there are plenty of other ways to listen to Spotify while driving, the company said this will provide a &#8220;more seamless&#8221; and personalized experience. Car Thing includes a touchscreen, a navigation knob, voice control and preset buttons to access your favorite music, podcasts and playlists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is actually an updated version of an in-car device that Spotify started testing a couple years ago. While Spotify is now making Car Thing available more broadly, it sounds like the company still views this as a bit of an experiment — during this limited U.S. release, it&#8217;s available for free, with users just paying for the cost of shipping.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase, the American cryptocurrency trading giant, has set a reference price for its direct listing at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-reference-price-set-250-205421091.html">$250 per share</a>. According to the company&#8217;s most recent SEC filing, it has a fully diluted share count of 261.3 million, giving the company a valuation of $65.3 billion. Using a simple share count of 196,760,122 provided in its most recent S-1/A filing, Coinbase would be worth a slimmer $49.2 billion.</p>
<p>Regardless of which share count is used to calculate the company&#8217;s valuation, its new worth is miles above its final private price set in 2018 when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/coinbase-is-now-valued-at-8b-after-closing-new-300m-round/">was worth $8 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Immediate chatter following the company&#8217;s direct listing reference price was that the price could be low. While Coinbase will not suffer usual venture capital censure if its shares quickly appreciate as it is not selling stock in its flotation, it would still be slightly humorous if its set reference price was merely a reference to an overly conservative estimate of its worth.</p>
<p>Its private backers are in for a bonanza either way. Around four years ago in 2017 Coinbase was worth just $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase data. For investors in that round, let alone its earlier fundraises, the valuation implied by a $250 per-share price represents a multiple of around 40x from the price that they paid.</p>
<p>The Coinbase direct listing was turbocharged recently when the company provided a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">first-look at its Q1 2021 performance</a>. As TechCrunch reported at the time, the company&#8217;s recent growth was impressive, with revenue scaling from $585.1 million in Q4 2020, to $1.8 billion in the first three months of this year. The new numbers set an already-hot company&#8217;s public debut on fire.</p>
<p>Place your bets now concerning where Coinbase might open, and how high its value may rise. It&#8217;s going to be quite the show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are about to be a lot of antitrust bills taking aim at Big Tech, and here&#8217;s one more. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) rolled out <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-trust-busting-twenty-first-century-act-plan-bust-anti-competitive-big">a new bill this week</a> that would take some severe measures to rein in Big Tech&#8217;s power, blocking mergers and acquisitions outright.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act&#8221; would ban any acquisitions by companies with a market cap of more than $100 billion, including vertical mergers. The bill also proposes changes that would dramatically heighten the financial pain for companies caught engaging in anti-competitive behavior, forcing any company that loses an antirust suit to forfeit profits made through those business practices.</p>
<p>At its core, Hawley&#8217;s legislation would snip some of the red tape around antitrust enforcement by amending the Sherman Act, which made monopolies illegal, and the Clayton Act, which expanded the scope of illegal anti-competitive behavior. The idea is to make it easier for the FTC and other regulators to deem a company&#8217;s behavior anti-competitive — a key criticism of the outdated antitrust rules that haven&#8217;t kept pace with the realities of the tech industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill isn&#8217;t likely to get too far in a Democratic Senate, but it&#8217;s not insignificant. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who chairs the Senate&#8217;s antitrust subcommittee, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">proposed legislation earlier this year</a> that would also create barriers for dominant companies with a habit of scooping up their competitors. Klobuchar&#8217;s own ideas for curtailing Big Tech&#8217;s power similarly focus on reforming the antitrust laws that have shaped U.S. business for more than a century.</p>
<p><object data="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800"><p><a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf">Click to access The%20Trust-Busting%20for%20the%20Twenty-First%20Century%20Act.pdf</a></p></object></p>
<p>The Republican bill may have some overlap with Democratic proposals, but it still hits some familiar notes from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">Trump era of hyperpartisan Big Tech criticism</a>. Hawley slams &#8220;woke mega-corporations&#8221; in Silicon Valley for exercising too much power over the information and products that Americans consume. While Democrats naturally don&#8217;t share that critique, Hawley&#8217;s bill makes it clear that antitrust reform targeting Big Tech is one policy area where both political parties could align on the ends, even if they don&#8217;t see eye to eye on the why.</p>
<p>Hawley&#8217;s bill is the latest, but it won&#8217;t be the last. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), who spearheads tech antitrust efforts in the House, previously announced his own plans to introduce <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">a flurry of antitrust reform bills</a> rather than one sweeping piece of legislation. Those bills, which will be more narrowly targeted to make them difficult for tech lobbyists to defeat, are due out in May.</p>
