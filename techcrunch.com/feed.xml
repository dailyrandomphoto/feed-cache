										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Banking is undergoing a huge transformation and how debt collections operations engage customers is becoming a big issue, especially with things like BNPL schemes. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in the last few years digitalizing financial and other services, but debt collections operations remain very manual and archaic resulting in frustration for customers and lost money for service providers. Banks are having to deal with this change and fintech startups are appearing to deal with it.</p>
<p>Back in May this year, <a href="https://receeve.com/en/">Receeve</a>, a no-code SaaS startup that makes it easier for companies to collect and recover debts (such as overdue claims) increased their seed funding to $13.5M with venture capital funds Seaya Ventures and 14W. Existing backers, Mangrove, Speedinvest, and Seedcamp participated in the expansion round –  bringing re:ceeve’s total war chest to more than $12M.</p>
<p>With re:ceeve, company teams can automate processes across the credit management value chain. Its customers include banks, alternative lenders, utilities and telcos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243957" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since then the startup has not been resting.</p>
<p>It has now bagged ABN AMRO &#8211; the third-largest bank in the Netherlands &#8211; as a partner and investor, gaining a seed-extension of €4m from the bank’s venture arm. So it&#8217;s now sitting on $16M.</p>
<p>Receeve and ABN AMRO Ventures are also entering into a strategic partnership. This means the banks’ customers who are most vulnerable to debt get more support.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO can now access Receeve’s platform get a “unified view” of the customer on top of their current technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paul Jozefak, receeve’s CEO said: “Both companies share a vision on delivering advanced data and digital solutions to build the best customer experiences. The commitment to innovation is reflected in ABN AMRO Ventures partnering with receeve to help forge the solution roadmap and be the leader in creating a better journey for the most vulnerable customers while at the same time providing tools to its employees to continually improve their experience as well.”</p>
<p>Hugo Bongers, Head of ABN AMRO Ventures adds “receeve’s approach and growth trajectory immediately intrigued us. We look forward to collaborating with the whole team to not only deliver great value to ABN AMRO, but we are excited to partner as investors to fuel growth and expansion and build a market leader across Europe and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after competitor Proofpoint was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scooped up by Thoma Bravo for $12.3 billion</a>, <a href="http://mimecast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimecast</a> is also going the private equity route. Today the security company announced that Permira would be taking Mimecast private in a $5.8 billion all-cash deal. Mimecast has been public since 2015, and this deal is being made at a price of $80 per share, the parties said.</p>
<p>The news follows a report published earlier today that Thoma Bravo was <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/211207/p9#a211207p9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $35 billion</a> to focus on buy-outs of tech companies, and comes in a year that has been a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-30/private-equity-s-taste-for-tech-sparks-record-80-billion-spree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very active one for PE firms</a> in the sector.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and people working more remotely and shifting everything online, it has also been a very, very big year for cybersecurity, and so that puts a particular focus on London-founded Mimecast&#8217;s specialty area of e-mail security. The company, listed on Nasdaq, has more than 39,000 business customers, with some 20,000 of those using its products to secure Microsoft 365 deployments in particular. It has been trading up over this year and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MIME?p=MIME&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last closed at $75/share</a> and with a market cap of just under $5 billion; this deal represents a premium on that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243956" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We have long admired Mimecast, its management team and its talented employees,” said Permira Partners&#8217; Michail Zekkos and Ryan Lanpher in a joint statement. “Email is the leading vector for cyberattacks, and phishing and impersonation attempts are continuously evolving. This means there has never been more urgency or need for organizations to protect their critical data and infrastructure. With an innovative platform, world-class security controls and scalable model, Mimecast is ideally positioned to help companies both large and small protect their employees from malicious activity. We look forward to leveraging our experience scaling global technology businesses as we partner with Peter and team on their next phase of growth.”</p>
<p>“Today is an exciting milestone for Mimecast as we begin a new chapter for our company,” added Peter Bauer, chairman and chief executive officer of Mimecast, in a statement. “Our team has done an outstanding job growing and expanding our relationships with customers and innovating our platform. Permira has a strong track record of collaboratively supporting companies’ growth ambitions and strategic goals, and we look forward to working together to further strengthen the cybersecurity and resilience of organizations around the world. This is a great outcome for our company and our shareholders.”</p>
<p>The company had been in the midst of a strategic review prior to the deal and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mimecast-explores-options-including-a-possible-sale-11635367602?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors were floated at the end of October</a> that it was looking at raising money or selling itself.</p>
<p>“This transaction follows a strategic process overseen and directed by an independent Special Committee of the Board of Directors that included discussion with a number of strategic and financial parties. We are pleased to deliver significant immediate cash value to our shareholders and believe that this transaction is the best path forward for Mimecast and our stakeholders,&#8221; said Robert Schechter, independent director of Mimecast and chair of the Special Committee, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, which include approval by Mimecast shareholders and regulatory approvals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[2021 has been a rosy year for China-based Amazon vendors looking for exits.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2021 has been a rosy year for China-based Amazon vendors looking for exits. Roll-ups, or brand aggregators, have been flooding China&#8217;s export-oriented e-commerce market with capital to scoop up sellers. The roll-ups themselves are fueled by venture capital, such as Silicon Valley&#8217;s Markai, which recently raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/markai-china-amazon-aggregator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $4 million</a> from investors like Pear VC and Sea Capital to acquire Chinese brands.</p>
<p>Other aggregators targeting China have raked in greater sums. Nebula Brands, a Beijing-based Amazon aggregator, said Tuesday that it has closed a Series B funding round of more than $50 million. The investment was led by the Asian fund of L Catterton, a global private equity firm known for its consumer tech focus.</p>
<p>Financing the latest round also included Nebula&#8217;s Series A investor Matrix Partners and its angel investor Alpha Startup Fund. The company has raised roughly $60 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Amazon grew into a behemoth, many of its third-party Chinese vendors also thrived and became multi-million-dollar businesses. These exporters are now in need of greater capital and talent to sustain growth, and the top-performing ones are given two options: get equity funding to scale further, or sell the business and move on. The latter path is where roll-ups come into play.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese third-party vendor marketplace is experiencing rapid growth, with the ability to quickly scale and provide high quality products efficiently to Amazon customers across the globe,&#8221; Nebula&#8217;s co-founder <span class="xn-person">William Wang</span> said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The model of aggregating Fulfillment by Amazon vendors and strengthening their operations has already proven to be extremely effective in some markets in the west and is set to take-off in China, where Nebula Brands is leading the charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new proceeds, Nebula is wrestling with a raft of foreign aggregators that have come hunting for Chinese sellers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/berlin-brands-group-enter-china-roll-up-amazon-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a>, Razor Group and Thrasio. The startup, founded only in May, has already acquired one vendor and it&#8217;s on track to close several more deals by the end of the year, it told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nebula currently operates a team of over 50 employees in China &#8220;with deep knowledge of the market and extensive on-the-ground sourcing, underwriting, and operating experience from previous roles at renowned e-commerce, technology, and financial firms,&#8221; the company said. Its co-founders are Ryan Ren, who was a CEO at a &#8220;listed company,&#8221; William Wang, former head of integrated marketing at Lenovo, and Hardys Wu, former head of supply chain at Wayfair.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was in 2017 that I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/rajeeb-deys-new-career-platform-learnerbly-secures-1-6m-led-by-frontline-ventures/">covered</a> the emergence and first funding of <a href="https://www.learnerbly.com/">Learnerbly</a>, a SaaS marketplace for professional development. Quite a lot has happened since then, not the least of which was the COVID-19 pandemic, which has meant pretty much meant all kinds of learning had to transition to virtual, including inside corporates.</p>
<p>The UK startup has now secured a $10 million Series A funding round led by Beringea. Also participating were new investors Digital Horizon Ventures, BY Venture Partners, GO Ventures, and FJ Labs. This was alongside existing investors Frontline Ventures, Triple Point, London Co-Investment Fund and UFI Ventures.</p>
<p>Learnerbly has also secured some angel investors including Zach Coelius (Coelius Capital), Leonard Picardo (second employee at Deliveroo), Neil Ryland (CRO of Peakon), Renaud Visage (Co-Founder and CTO of Eventbrite), and Stephan Thoma (former Global Head of Learning at Google). So far it has secured clients including Hellofresh, King, WeTransfer, Curve, Busuu and GoCardless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243947" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Learnerbly’s online marketplace offers access to books, podcasts, conferences, courses, coaching, and more from over 250 providers including Blinkist, Masterclass, Pluralsight, and General Assembly and is aimed at engineers, marketers, finance and sales etc.</p>
<p>Founder Rajeeb Dey MBE was previously best known for scaling <a href="https://enternships.com/">Enternships</a> – a portal connecting students and graduates with work placements in start-ups and fast-growth businesses.</p>
<p>He commented: “With the rise of the ‘great resignation’ and employers globally concerned about how they retain, as well as attract top talent in an increasingly competitive market the focus on learning and development has never been greater. Businesses are struggling to navigate the new normal of hybrid and remote working and facilitating the personal and professional growth of employees has become even trickier.”</p>
<p>Maria Wagner, Investment Director at Beringea, commented: “With the hybrid work environment, employers are under pressure to offer new ways of learning for their employees and ensure they are engaged and retained… Learnerbly offers a curated solution that serves both the needs of the employees and of HR departments in this new environment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The best known players in this field are the likes of Workday Learning, Cornerstone, or a newer player like 360Learning which raised $200m. Others include Degreed and Edcast. While most are focused on the large enterprise market, Learnably is aimed at scale-ups and mid-market companies (employees up to 2000 people.) </p>
<p>Dey told me that Learnerbly is particularly aimed at companies with “over-stretched people teams and limited in-house L&amp;D expertise/support.” Hence why it&#8217;s aimed at tech startups a lot of the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest pain points for any business, but especially SMEs, is managing payroll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A startup that has built payroll automation software to make the process less painful, Pento, has raised $35 million in a Series B round of funding co-led by Tiger Global Management and Avid Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks Tiger Global’s first time investing in London-based Pento. Avid has invested previously, along with other existing backers General Catalyst, Seedcamp and LocalGlobe. It also comes just six months after the startup raised a $15.6 million Series A led by General Catalyst. The company declined to reveal at what valuation either round was raised, saying only that its current valuation is “a meaningful step up” from its Series A. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Jonas Bøgh Larsen and Emil Hagbarth Rasmussen in 2017, </span><a href="http://pento.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pento</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has now raised $53.4 million since its inception. The startup’s mission is to help free up companies from “onerous outsourcing and outdated software.” Pento says its SaaS offering fully automates the payroll process so that payroll managers and finance teams don’t have to rely on spreadsheets, PDFs, e-mails and manual checks. It claims to reduce the amount of time its customers spend on payroll by up to 80% by giving them “more control and visibility” over their monthly pay run. It does this by automating everything from tax calculations to payments to reporting requirements so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that businesses of any size “can run their payroll in minutes instead of days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be doing something right. CEO and co-founder Bøgh Larsen said that over the past year, Pento has seen its revenue climb “10x.” While we don’t know from what base, the company did say it has seen “consecutive record-breaking months of growth” since its Series A. It’s also added several “major” new customers, including Britain’s Starling Bank, as well as integrations with partners such as Personio, Hibob and BambooHR. Other customers include tech startups Pleo and Cuvva as well as Honest Burgers and Beauty Pie. In general, Pento works with hundreds of SMEs and mid-sized businesses with 30 to 500 employees, and is increasingly serving larger enterprises with around 2,000 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its SaaS model, the company makes money by charging customers a set monthly fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it plans to expand internationally in the future, Pento for now is focused on its home market of the U.K. and Europe, where it says that payroll outsourcing is a nearly $6 billion market that is expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.4%. In the U.K. alone, there are an estimated 20,000 small </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and medium-sized</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses and 4,000 mid-market businesses that are potential customers, it says.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">represents an opportunity to transform payroll automation for nearly 10 million employees</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">within the U.K. alone and a $1+ billion annual revenue opportunity,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bøgh Larsen said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243806" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243806" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243806 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/core_productdark@2x.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pento</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pento plans to use its new capital in part to expand into new European countries and toward product development, service expansion and partner integrations. It also, naturally, plans to do some hiring. It’s already grown its team to 70 employees, up from 20 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its SaaS offering, Pento provides infrastructure through its partnerships and integrations with existing accounting software, HR products and pension providers. It has also developed an open payroll API that is currently in beta, with the aim of allowing any business to build custom integrations to automate more of their workflows, such as time-tracking or shift planning. That API will also allow employees to share pay and compensation data with third-party apps and services to validate their income to credit agencies, as well as other financial and HR organizations, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built Pento having seen firsthand just how broken the current payroll processes are, and our continued success showcases just how strongly forward-thinking companies are asking for tools to fix this,” said Bøgh Larsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors include France&#8217;s PayFit, ADP and legacy services-heavy payroll outsourcing businesses. Pento says that its main differentiator is that it is building a payroll-only product with an integrations-first approach, meaning that &#8212; as opposed to much of its competition &#8212; Pento partners and integrates with other tools/products (such as HR, expenses management and accounting) that customers use instead of building their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That distinction was a big draw for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addie Lerner, founder and managing partner at Avid Ventures, who said her firm has become increasingly excited about the “n of 1” market opportunity for Pento to be a pure-play payroll automation leader in Europe, and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to hear positive feedback from the market on Pento’s strategy of focusing on payroll only rather than payroll plus HR,” she wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer term, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if Pento can become the infrastructure layer for HR and compensation via its soon-to-be-rolled-out open API, Lerner added, the company would become further embedded into its customers’ payroll and HR workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It could then leverage its strategic positioning of managing payroll for its customers and being in the critical flow of payroll payments to monetize a suite of ‘Pento for Employee’ products including financial offerings such as lending, KYC, and more,” she said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.felixcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felix Capital</a>, the London VC firm that has built a portfolio emphasizing investments in startups in the ecosystem that supports the creative class, is bringing on two more partners, Julien Codorniou and Susan Lin, as it continues to expand into a wider range of categories.</p>
<p>Codorniou had been a longtime executive at Meta (formerly Facebook), where he worked across different products for businesses, most significantly as VP of Workplace, the company&#8217;s effort to build a version of Facebook tailored to the working world. Lin is an internal promotion, and in what is perhaps a mark of just how slow change is to come to the halls of power and money in the world of tech, she is actually the first female partner at Felix since the firm was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/03/new-london-vc-firm-felix-capital-launches-with-120m-fund-and-team-of-elite-advisors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Felix &#8212; co-founded by longtime European investors Frederic Court and Antoine Nussenbaum &#8212; today says it has some $600 million under management with 47 active investments. That <a href="https://www.felixcap.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio</a> includes a range of companies that are, in a straightforward way, bets on some of the bigger tech trends in Europe and further afield: they include businesses crossing the nexus of food and e-commerce such as Deliveroo, HungryPanda, Oatly, AllPlants and Frichti; transport startups Dott and Heetch; travel startup Perfect Stay and recruitment platform Job Today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But there is also a big emphasis on startups putting out creator or creative products and content; or used by creators to help them work, with the list including companies like Farfetch, Business of Fashion, Moonbug, Mejuri and Goop; as well as Mirakl, SellerX, Sorare, Rally, Creative Fabrica, fraud prevention platform Forter, Juni and more.</p>
<p>Adding in two new partners will be a way of expanding Felix&#8217;s scope further, specifically into more categories to fill out those existing fields.</p>
<p>Codorniou, with his experience in building and evaluating workplace productivity tools &#8212; before Meta, he was at Microsoft as a director in business development &#8212; plans to look at and fund SaaS businesses with a focus around areas like the future of work (a pretty nebulous category these days, given how quickly working practices and work infrastructure have been forced to evolve in the wake of the pandemic). This is an area that Felix has been doubling down on of late, with investments in Mirakl, Job Today and Yoobic all part of a bigger and more generalized thesis around how working and building the infrastructure to work are changing fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent so much time in last five years talking to CIOs and CFOs, learning what they like or don&#8217;t like,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Budgets are moving from IT to HR, and we want to make the best of that convergence. It&#8217;s about building community at work, but I also think front line is the next frontier for automation and more.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tapping another area that loomed large both at Meta and in Europe these days, Cordorniou told TechCrunch he will be looking to back more gaming startups as well, particularly those emerging out of further-flung corners of the European region, and those that are pushing the boundaries of gameplay and monetization models. On the latter point, games have long been early movers and some of the biggest users of virtual currencies; now, with the rise of new kinds of gamification around cryptocurrency, it will be interesting to see how (and if) we see a wave of startups building gameplay that taps into that.</p>
<p>There is a talent connection between the two areas, too, he pointed out. &#8220;Obviously NFT is all the rage in gaming right now,&#8221; Codorniou said. &#8220;What is interesting is that the same people I worked with 10 years ago that used to be in social mobile gaming are now building new companies in the world of play to earn and crypto.&#8221; Sorare and Ledger are two existing investments in the portfolio that point to where and how Codorniou and Felix might back startups in the future.</p>
<p>Codorniou is joining as a partner at Felix, but he&#8217;s had a connection to the firm since day one, as one of its founding advisors &#8212; a formidable group of people, former founders or top executives, who have been leaning into Felix&#8217;s investment strategy as LPs without being full members of the team. (Others include David Marcus, Stephanie Phair, and Henri Moissinac.)</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, has been with Felix for three years &#8212; previous investment roles included time at Hg Capital and Bain &#8212; and as a partner she will be focusing on expanding the portfolio in another equally significant direction: by focusing on startups building tools for financial, physical and mental health and productivity. Felix already has a very decent foothold in this department, with investments in Peloton, Unmind, Peanut and Peppy among the startups that are already developing the wider health theme.</p>
<p>“Since first joining Felix almost three years ago, it was clear I was joining a unique team that is both highly collaborative and ambitious, with a distinctive and inspiring vision and mission,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;I have loved every minute of working with our own team, our founders and helping deepen our conviction and investments into newer areas such as consumer fintech and digital health. I am grateful for the development and trust in me, and am excited to continue helping to build Felix into a distinctive partner of choice for the best founders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Falcon Edge Capital, the New York-headquartered investment firm, has closed the first tranche of its new $10 billion fund and is rebranding as Alpha Wave Global, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Once the new fund &#8212; which is called Alpha Wave Ventures II &#8212; has completely closed, Alpha Wave Global&#8217;s AUM will exceed $15 billion, the source said. The firm, which began its life as a public market investor, plans to use the fresh fund to back startups globally, the source said, requesting anonymity as the details are private.</p>
<p>A single fund of $10 billion would be among the largest of its size globally.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243920" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported last week that Falcon Edge was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/falcon-edge-capital-eyes-raising-a-fund-of-over-10-billion/">talks to raise a new fund of $10 billion or more</a>. The firm expects to raise slightly more than $10 billion for the new fund, the source said.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global declined to comment.</p>
<p>Founded by Rick Gerson, Navroz D. Udwadia, and Ryan Khoury in 2012, Alpha Wave Global has this year emerged as one of the most aggressive investors globally. It has been very active in a handful of markets including the U.S. and India, the world’s second largest internet geography where Alpha Wave Global has deployed about $2 billion this year and minted at least 5 unicorns including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/indian-fintech-cred-valued-at-4-billion-following-251-million-fundraise/">fintech CRED</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/india-mensa-a-house-of-d2c-brands-becomes-unicorn-in-just-six-months/">house of direct-to-consumer brands Mensa</a>. It&#8217;s currently in advanced stages to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/">co-lead a financing round in social commerce DealShare</a>, valuing the Indian firm at over $1.7 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier.</p>
<p>Alpha Wave Global, a Tiger Global grandcub, has borrowed many of the older firm’s strategies. Like Tiger Global, Alpha Wave Global is also very quick and aggressive with its investments. Instead of evaluating a startup in ad hoc, the firm maps the entire space and assesses whether it’s bullish about the category itself, Udwadia said in a virtual conference early this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm likes to get aggressive when most other investors are cautious about the market conditions, and slows down its dealmaking when everyone else is writing checks at a frenetic pace, he said. Alpha Wave Global has made over 40 investments in the private market this year, more than those it made in the past four years put together, according to CB Insights.</p>
<p>It has traditionally focused more on backing growth-stage startups, cutting checks in the range of $50 million to $150 million. But in recent years, through its fund called Alpha Wave Incubation, it has aggressively backed startups in seed and Series A financing stages.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Clubbi launched in October 2020 with 24-hour delivery, no minimum order quantity and flexible payment terms. It is currently working with 1,000 grocery stores in Rio de Janeiro.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.clubbi.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clubbi</a>, a Brazilian business-to-business resource for small food retailers, brought in $4.5 million in seed funding to expand across the country.</p>
<p>The remote first company started in 2020 as an online commerce resource for neighborhood markets and grocery stores — most that have never shopped online before — to stock up on products they need, offering competitive pricing and better customer service.</p>
<p>Co-founder João Macedo initially had the vision for Clubbi while working as head of distribution for Red Bull. He saw how fragmented and analog the commerce business was, resulting in difficulty reaching a large retail base. In fact, suppliers still rely on door-to-door sales, he told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“They depend on intermediaries, and that makes go-to-market more complex and expensive,” he added. “I lived in India, and it was fragmented there also, but B2B marketplaces were doing well there.”</p>
<p>Last year, he joined with Marcos Adler and Alexandre Farber to create a marketplace connecting suppliers, like Kraft Heinz, Adria and Piraquê, with markets.</p>
<p>Clubbi launched in October 2020 with 24-hour delivery, no minimum order quantity and flexible payment terms. It is currently working with 1,000 grocery stores in Rio de Janeiro, up from three at launch, with plans to grow to over 3,000 by mid 2022, Adler said. The company is also growing 40% month over month, gross merchandise value-wise.</p>
<p>“We reach a long tail of customers that are hard to service, are working with less working capital and offer them a single place to buy everything they need and have good delivery lead time to keep inventory fulfilled,” Adler added. “All they have to do is go on the website, place a one-click order and get it the next day on their doorstep.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Valor Capital Group co-led the round with ONEVC and was joined by Better Tomorrow Ventures, Latitud and Canary, which led Clubbi’s $550,000 pre-seed round.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to accelerate growth, technology development, expansion into other Brazilian cities and develop additional supplier partnerships. Clubbi offers about 7,000 to 8,000 SKUs on its marketplace, while the average store will carry 1,000 to 2,000 SKUs, Adler said. The company started with five employees and also plans to hire additional staff to bring its now 40-person employee base to 70 people by the middle of 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company still has a long way to go to get in front of over 200,000 mom-and-pop grocery stores in Brazil, which generate more than $35 billion in combined revenue, Valor Capital Group’s Antoine Colaço said in a written statement.</p>
<p>“These stores still face many challenges when trying to procure goods in an efficient and low-cost manner, and they also lack access to fair financing solutions,” Colaço said. “Clubbi is delivering an integrated and simple way for these stores to receive the best products — at the right prices and payment terms — at their doors. The social and economic development Clubbi generates is huge and the Company&#8217;s early results are very promising and impressive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.equinix.com/">Equinix</a> announced today that it is acquiring <a href="https://www.mainone.net/">MainOne</a>, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, for $320 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close Q1 of 2022, subject to the &#8220;satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equinix&#8217;s acquisition of MainOne follows a series of moves the global digital infrastructure player made last year when it expanded to India through the <a href="https://www.equinix.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/08/equinix-expands-to-india-with-acquisition-of-gpx-india">acquisition of GPX India</a> for $161 million and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/equinix-is-buying-13-data-centers-from-bell-canada-for-750m/">acquired 13 data centres from Bell Canada</a> for $780 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement, Equinix acknowledged that acquiring MainOne is the first step in its long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company.</p>
<p>&#8220;With more than 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an established data center hub. This makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent,&#8221; the company said in the statement.</p>
<p>Funke Opeke started MainOne in 2010 after noticing the poor internet connectivity Nigerians had to deal with upon her return to the West African country from the U.S.</p>
<p>Armed with over $200 million in equity and debt investment, Opeke built MainOne as West Africa&#8217;s first privately owned, open access undersea high capacity cable submarine. It&#8217;s a 7,000-kilometer cable stretching from Portugal to West Africa with landings along Accra in Ghana, Dakar in Senegal, Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and Lagos in Nigeria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MainOne also has 1,200 kilometers of terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria in Lagos, Edo and Ogun states. Connectivity to terrestrial sites extends across 65 PoPs (points of presence) in cities across Portugal, Nigeria, Ghana and the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>MainOne&#8217;s services are used by over 800 business-to-business customers. They include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service companies and cloud service providers.</p>
<p>Having enabled connectivity for these businesses via three operational data centers, MainOne plans to open an additional facility in Q1 2022, a move that coincides with Equinix&#8217;s acquisition.</p>
<p>MainOne, which has a 500-person team, said its facilities generate approximately $60 million annualized revenue with a purchase multiple of approximately 14x EBITDA.</p>
<p>Upon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions.</p>

<p>Globally, Equinix has 237 data centers across 27 countries. It also provides data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of the world&#8217;s leading businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market. MainOne’s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,&#8221; said Charles Meyers, the president and CEO of Equinix in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;MainOne’s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.”</p>
<p>MainOne CEO Funke Opeke and the company&#8217;s management team will still continue to serve in their respective roles after the acquisition is finalized.</p>
<p>Opeke said the acquisition will accelerate MainOne&#8217;s long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;With similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe is “solidifying its place as a global tech power”, according to Atomico’s annual State of European Tech 2021 report, research which has become an annual fixture of the European tech scene. According to the research, Europe is now the second region globally when it comes to early-stage investment, with a total of $3.8B vs the US at $4.1B. Europe now has 321 unicorns, up from 223 in 2020.</p>
<p>The report outlines how $3T of value has been unlocked, but Europe has $23T of potential value still to be unlocked. Some $100B in annual funding has been crossed for the first time. There is now a $100M funding round, roughly, every other day in Europe. And 100 new unicorns were minted in 2021 (323 overall, more than China). And Europe has now achieved a $250B exit value.</p>
<p>Furthermore, European VCs are outperforming their US counterparts. The Cambridge Associates index for European VC outperforms the US equivalent across 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20-year horizons. Plus, Europe is about to get its first $100B VC-backed tech company (Adyen got to 99B in August).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The report outlines how early-stage investment levels are now “on par” with US levels, with European unicorns on the up, faster growth than even before the pandemic, and growth which added a $1 trillion of value in the first 8 months of 2021.</p>
<p>The report’s key trends will be discussed at a digital event on December 7th at 16:00 GMT with insights from some of Europe’s most prominent founders and investors, <a href="https://hopin.com/events/2021-state-of-european-tech-2021-report-launch">you can access it free here</a>.</p>
<p>The report has outlined 5 key trends which TechCrunch is reproducing in full below, followed by further research TechCrunch requested from the report’s authors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; <strong>Europe is solidifying as a global tech player </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>European tech is projected to cross the $100B milestone of capital invested in a single year, close to 3 times the level in 2020. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>The total number of tech companies that have scaled to $1B+ in Europe has jumped from 223 last year to 321. (Source: Dealroom, Atomico)</p>
<p>Large rounds ($250M+) are now the norm in Europe &#8212; these grew 10x versus last year, now representing 40% of the total capital invested in the region. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Europe has its strongest ever pipeline of early stage startups with the region accounting for 33% of all capital invested globally in rounds of up to $5M. This makes Europe the second region globally when it comes to early stage investment, with a total of $3.8B vs the US at $4.1B. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Looking at the number of unicorns per inhabitant, Cambridge emerges as the unicorn capital of Europe. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Outcomes are exceeding projections in both public and private markets</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, Europe has added over $750B of public tech market cap value and currently sits over $2T. (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>Europe continues to produce more tech IPOs than the US with 122 IPOs versus 89 for the US in 2021, however more needs to be done to address the impediments to large-cap IPOs taking place in Europe. (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>Blockbusters IPOs ($10B+) are becoming the norm. The largest IPO of 2021 is Romanian company UiPath, debuting at around $35.6B after opening day gains. Other large scale public listings included Auto1, Wise and Deliveroo, which all traded above $10B on their first day. (Source: Atomico)</p>
<p>15 European tech companies have gone public via SPACs in 2021 for a combined EV of $62B. 14 of the 15 companies are now listed on US exchanges. 13 of the 15 were VC-backed. </p>
<p>They cover key tech areas, such as quantum computing, electric mobility, semiconductors, fintech and digital health. 9 out of 15 companies from the UK &#8211; all of them went public in the US on US exchanges. (Source: CapitalIQ)</p>
<p>The aggregate value of exits of European tech companies via M&#038;A and public listings is already well over $180B and has exceeded 2020 levels &#8212; this is the highest it has been in the last five years. ​​2021 has been a record year so far for dealmaking, with a total of 47 $1B+ PE-backed exits recorded, almost 4x as much as in the whole of 2020. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>There are currently 26 VC-backed European tech companies with decacorn status compared to 12 in 2020. Adyen is now on track to be the first European tech company founded post 2000 to hit the $100B mark, with their valuation reaching a 2021 YTD high of $99B in November 2021. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; European fintech is soaring; ‘Planet Positive’ startups gain traction</strong></p>
<p>In absolute terms, fintech had the most significant increase  (+132%) with investments growing from $9.4B in 2020 to $21.7B in the first nine months of 2021, followed by enterprise software at +$5.9B (89% increase) and transportation at +$4.9B (95% increase). (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>1 in 5 European unicorns is a fintech company (and that number rises to 1 in 3 for private unicorns). This also includes 4 of the 10 most valuable tech companies in Europe. (Source: Atomico)<br />
Crypto and blockchain deal count is up 5x in Europe over the past 5 years, but lags behind the US. Still, Europe already has 8 crypto unicorns. (Source: Pitchbook, Atomico)</p>
<p>Over $34B has been invested in purpose-driven tech companies in Europe in the last five years, representing 17% of all funding. Purpose-driven companies are defined as companies building a sustainable future for all by addressing one or more SDGs. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Planet Positive investments  &#8212; defined as companies working to make sustainable use of the planet’s resources &#8212; captured 11% of total funding overall in 2021, with Clean Energy and Climate tech startups capturing the lion&#8217;s share of funding with 24% and 19% respectively of all capital invested in purpose-driven tech companies in 2017-2021 YTD. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Access to funding and talent are key challenges for European tech founders, but a virtuous cycle of talent is well under way</strong></p>
<p>This year, Atomico partnered with Dealroom and Extend Ventures to carry out the biggest ever analysis of the talent pipeline in Europe, screening over 45,000 profiles of founders and senior leaders working across close to 5,000 European tech companies. Close to 40% are multi-generational leaders having worked for both more established tech and younger companies. </p>
<p>Close to 1 in 5 have gained experience in a $1B+ companies, and 16% have moved countries at some point in their career. (Source: Atomico, Dealroom, Extend Ventures)</p>
<p>Although the talent depth continues to improve across all stages of a company&#8217;s journey, it is a lot harder for founders at the seed and series A levels to hire talent. 58% of founders at seed and 64% at series A mention it is harder to acquire talent compared to 12 months ago. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>Compared to 12 months ago, women and ethnic minorities find working for a European tech company more attractive than men or white individuals with 73% of women and 75% of non-white individuals indicating an increasd attractiveness of working in European tech. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>But if Europe wants to reach its long-term ambitions, it needs to address the structural issues that are still holding it back</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Europe needs to fund women and diverse teams</strong></p>
<p>Women and ethnic minorities still find it much harder to raise capital than their male and white counterparts. Overall, 29% of respondents indicate that being from an underrepresented background negatively affected their ability to raise capital. However, this percentage rises to 49% for women and 39% for non-white founders. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>Based on Extend Ventures analysis of a sample of 4,684 tech companies headquartered in Europe that have raised more than $2M of total funding since 1st of January 2020, only 0.7% of the total capital raised to date has been raised by Black women founders, 1.1% by Black men founders, 22.7% by white women founders (Source: Extend Ventures)</p>
<p>Despite evidence showing that mixed and diverse teams perform better &#8212; they still only capture 9% of the capital raised in 2021. (source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Although the ecosystem has matured as a whole, this is not the case everywhere</p>
<p>Despite having close to 30% of the European population, the CEE region has the lowest inflow of capital into its venture ecosystem amongst all the regions. (Source: Invest Europe)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Pension funds need to step up</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds ($3T in total assets) continue to disappoint in allocations to VC (less than 0.03%). Pushing that allocation to just 1% would be a seismic shift. (Source: Invest Europe)<br />
Smart policy could be a competitive advantage on the global stage</p>
<p>Tech is flourishing in Europe, but it has so far been in spite of rather than thanks to policy and regulatory conditions. Yet smart policy can make the flywheel spin faster and give us a competitive advantage on the global stage. </p>
<p>According to investors, founders and policy experts across Europe, the focus should be on fixing the basics: Lowering the friction on talent, unlocking access to funding for both founders and investors, and harmonising rules between countries. They also think more could be done to make regulation future proof. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>There is optimism for better collaboration between startups and scaleups and regulatory bodies. Across all countries analysed, a larger percentage of respondents said the European regulatory environment is getting better rather than worse with the smallest vote of confidence coming from UK based respondents and the largest from Norway. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>The report, an annual deep dive into European tech industry data across 45 countries, is published in partnership with tech conference organizer Slush, and with the support of Orrick, Silicon Valley Bank, and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked the Reports authors to comment on the key challenges where European tech needs to work harder on. We are reproducing them below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8211; Access to capital</strong><br />
    •   Based on Extend Ventures analysis of a sample of 4,684 tech companies headquartered in Europe that have raised more than $2M of total funding since 1st of January 2020, only 0.7% of the total capital raised to date has been raised by Black women founders, 1.1% by Black men founders, 22.7% by White women</p>
<p>    •   In all the headlines of $100B raised, the reality for most founders is it&#8217;s still hard to raise money. Access to capital at an early stage is still a real challenge (bifurcating model). So even though there’s been 3X the amount of capital raised, a meaningful proportion of founders say it&#8217;s got harder to raise money over the last year, not easier. The top quartile of European countries raised $496.7 per capita while the 2nd raised $152.1, 3rd $9.9 and bottom raised $1.0.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The North-South divide is stark: </strong></p>
<p>    •   The five largest hubs by total capital invested (London, Berlin, Stockholm, Munich and Paris) are home to companies that between them captured 54% of total investment in Europe in 2021.</p>
<p>    •   Increased levels of investment in more established, growth stage companies has widened the funding divide in favour of Europe&#8217;s most developed tech ecosystems. </p>
<p>    •   While the level of per capita investment in top and second quartile countries (Northern and Western Europe) spiked materially in 2021 compared to prior years, this has not been mirrored by investment patterns into countries in the lower quartiles (Southern and Eastern Europe). The question then becomes how Europe unlocks the potential of these southern hubs? </p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Pension funds need to step up in a big way (0.018% of their allocation goes to tech) (they have $3T). It’s a huge missed opportunity. </strong></p>
<p>Talent &#8211; although the depth and quality is there, hiring challenges might be a limiting factor. UK startup founders were more likely to find acquisition of new talent becoming harder in the last year than in the rest of Europe.  </p>
<p>Policy: DSA+DMA<DSM. Alongside access to funding and talent, a survey of 5,000 founders across 45 European countries said regulation is one of the big challenges to the ecosystem and fixing it could unlock growth. They want changes to employment law, changes to stock options, the ability to access talent, less fragmentation of rules across countries because as they’re expanding across Europe it’s taking on greater importance. 

15 European tech companies have gone public via SPACs in 2021 for a combined EV of $62B. 14 of the 15 companies are now listed on US exchanges. 13 of the 15 were VC-backed. They cover key tech areas, such as quantum computing, electric mobility, semiconductors, fintech and digital health. We need to build public markets as sophisticated as our private markets are.

<strong>A few thoughts on the UK:</strong></p>
<p>To maintain its edge, UK tech needs to widen its appeal</p>
<p>    •   The UK has the largest number of $1B+ companies listed in Europe but has seen more of its largest tech companies choose to list in the US than other major European countries (14%). (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>    •   9 UK companies that went public via SPACs in 2021 all of them went public in the US on US exchanges. </p>
<p>    •   The UK market continues to be extremely competitive, with <strong>UK based founders reporting a net worsening in the depth of the talent pool.</strong> While only 33% of UK based founders are indicating an improvement in the talent pool with 37% saying it has worsened, 54% of founders in France, 52% in Italy, 47% in Sweden, and 46% in Spain are indicating <strong>an improvement in the depth of the talent pool.</strong> (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Electronics announced today it has merged its mobile and consumer electronics units and unveiled its new leadership to replace its three major divisions leaders, effective starting today (Dec.7), in the company’s biggest shake-up since 2017.</p>
<p>Jong-Hee (JH) Han, head of visual display business, was promoted to vice chairman and co-CEO and will lead the newly merged mobile and consumer electronics unit, which is also called SET division, and continue to head the visual display business.</p>
<p>Han, who played a key role in the company achieving the company’s top position in global TV sales for the last 15 years, is expected to “strengthen the synergies among the different businesses in the SET division and help drive new business and technologies,” Samsung said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243887" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kyehyun Kyung, CEO of Samsung Elecro-Mechanics, was also named co-CEO of Samsung Electronics and will lead the company’s device solutions (DS) division spanning semiconductor and components units.</p>
<p>The tech giant said the new leadership will help to lead “the next phase of the company’s future growth and to strengthen its business competitiveness.”</p>
<p>The consolidation of its two main units, mobile and consumer electronics, is seen as an effort to simplify its structures and focus more on the semiconductor business.</p>
<p>The sweeping reshuffle announcement comes roughly four months after the company’s vice president and de facto leader Jay Y. Lee was released on parole in August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung announced in November its plans for a $17 billion US semiconductor plant in Taylor Texas and laid out a $205 billion investment plan, which includes semiconductor, artificial intelligence, robotics, and biopharma, over the next three years.</p>
<p>Kinam Kim, the former vice chairman and head of the DS division, was named chairman of Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology. As part of its reshuffle, the company also named Hark Kyu Park as its new chief financial officer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By today&#8217;s standards, $10 million isn&#8217;t a lot of capital to invest.  But <a href="https://www.iterative.vc/">Iterative</a>, which describes itself as a YC-style accelerator focused exclusively on Southeast Asia, says the $10 million it has raised from a cadre of Silicon Valley bigs &#8212; including investor Andrew Chen of Andreessen Horowitz, Chi-Hua Chien of Goodwater Capital, and Qasar Younis, the cofounder of Applied Intuition and former COO of Y Combinator &#8212; is enough to make its mark on the region, where it&#8217;s been writing checks to nascent startups over the last 18 months.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate Iterative&#8217;s interest in the region. As Iterative cofounder Brian Ma is quick to note, the vast majority of the 676 million people who live in Southeast Asia are now internet users &#8212; and spending their money online. Indeed, according to report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain &amp; Company that was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/southeast-asia-internet-economy-hit-1-trln-by-2030-report-says-2021-11-10/">published early last month</a>, the region has added 60 million new internet users since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total to 440 million. Meanwhile, driven primarily by growth in e-commerce and food delivery, the online industry for Southeast Asia is expected to grow from an estimated $174 billion in gross merchandise volume by the end of this year, to $360 billion by 2025, and $1 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>With a growing number of startups in the region becoming so-called unicorn companies &#8212; including Grab, the ride-hailing app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">just went public</a> by merging with a blank-check company, and GoTo, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/gojek-to-combine-with-tokopedia-to-create-indonesia-tech-giant">formed this year</a> by merging the ride-hailing company Go-Jek with the popular online shopping portal, Tokopedia (GoTo expects to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/andre-soelistyo-indonesian-behind-gojek-tokopedia-merger-bloomberg-50-2021">go public</a> early in 2022) &#8212;  it&#8217;s also probably safe to imagine that competition is heating up and that Iterative won&#8217;t receive the same favorable terms it has garnered thus far for much longer. (Currently, it invests $150,000 per startup in exchange for 10% of the business.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ma &#8212; who also cofounded Divvy Homes, a rent-to-own platform now value by investors at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/tiger-bets-on-divvy-homes-as-startup-hits-2-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">$2 billion</a> &#8212; readily acknowledges that the investing scene in Southeast Asia is poised to get crowded fast, which could impact terms and valuations. He says that&#8217;s okay with him, though.</p>
<p>For one thing, Iterative has already invested $3.6 million across 26 companies, more than a handful of which have already announced meaningful follow-on funding, including <a href="http://spenmo.com">Spenmo</a> (it just raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/insight-partners-leads-34m-round-in-singapore-based-fintech-spenmo">$34 million</a> round led by Insight Partners), <a href="https://www.coderschool.vn">Coder School</a>, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/vietnam-based-coderschool-gets-2-6m-pre-series-a-to-scale-online-course-platform">$2.6 million</a> in pre-Series A funding led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures, and <a href="https://www.gozayaan.com">Go Zayaan</a>, which has raised <a href="https://e27.co/wavemaker-airbnb-execs-join-us2-6m-financing-round-of-bdesh-ota-startup-go-zayaan-20210929">$2.6 million</a> in seed funding led by Wavemaker Partners. In short, Iterative has already planted many seeds for the amount that just one nascent U.S. company might raised in its first round of funding.</p>
<p>Ma &#8212; who founded Iterative with friend Hsu Ken, the former chief product officer of Workmate, an on-demand blue collar staffing platform in Southeast Asia &#8212; seems also to want to help founders in the region who have relatively little (for now) experience with investors and with seasoned operators.</p>
<p>In fact, he says that when he first began meeting with founders in the region, some told him they were being offered $150,000 checks for upwards of 30% of their company, which is . . . a lot. (Part of Iterative&#8217;s promise is access to both Ma and Ken but also access to a broader network of founders and investors, along with a kind of fundraising bootcamp, so founders know how to pitch, and what agreements not to strike.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Iterative&#8217;s timing looks prescient in the meantime. While regional funds are <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Venture-capital-doubles-down-on-Southeast-Asian-tech2">doubling down</a> on their commitments with bigger funds, like Jungle Ventures and 500 Startups, and while global investors like Tiger Global and Accel <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/tiger-global-accel-back-indonesia-s-latest-fintech-unicorn">pick up the pace</a> in a variety of Southeast Asian countries, the seed-stage scene is just forming, by Ma&#8217;s telling. &#8220;It&#8217;s happening literally this year and maybe last year that you&#8217;re starting to see execs from Grab and Facebook and [Southeast Asia shopping giant] Lazada start to write $5,000 and $10,000 checks,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing that makes it really exciting for me. The ecosystem is just now starting to recycle, and when that starts to happen, you see tech ecosystems develop.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Iterative&#8217;s own development, somewhat naturally, the outfit already has a bigger fund in its sights. Asked how much Iterative might raise in 2022, Ma says he expects to close a fund that&#8217;s closer to $50 million, given what the market &#8212; and he and cofounder &#8212; can absorb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still talking to advisors about it,&#8221; Ma says. &#8220;But we&#8217;re definitely going to raise the fund because the pilot fund has gone really well. Obviously, too,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;the opportunity is only accelerating.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A virtual bank is soon coming to Indonesia. WeLab, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/welab-75-million-fundraise-allianz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Kong-based fintech unicorn</a>, announced Tuesday its acquisition of Bank Jasa Jakarta (BJJ), an Indonesian commercial bank.</p>
<p>With the deal, WeLab is planning to launch a digital bank to capture the country&#8217;s enormous unbanked population in the second half of next year.</p>
<p>A consortium led by WeLab has raised $240 million from existing and new investors, which the company claimed was the largest fintech funding in Indonesia this year. The capital will go towards acquiring BJJ&#8217;s stakes and &#8220;tech investments&#8221;, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243828" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The consortium, called WeLab Sky,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> will acquire the stakes of BJJ to become its sole controlling shareholder. WeLab Sky has already bought a 24% stake in the bank, while the remaining shares for majority control will be transferred upon securing regulatory approvals.</span></p>
<p>Backed by Hong Kong billionaire<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/hong-kong-based-financial-startup-welab-raises-14m-series-a-from-sequoia-and-tom-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s TOM Group</a>, WeLab opened its first digital bank in Hong Kong, a global financial center, last year. The company currently operates a suite of consumer fintech products across Asia, including the virtual bank and a lending product in its home city, as well as several types of lending services in mainland China and Indonesia. It also provides technology &#8220;enabling&#8221; services to traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>In terms of user size, WeLab said it has amassed over 150,000 digital banking customers. Its online lending app for Southeast Asia, Maucash, which it launched through a joint venture with Astra International, has more than three million Indonesian users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel plans to take Mobileye, the advanced driver assistance and automated driving subsidiary it acquired for $15 billion more than four years ago, public next year.</p>
<p>Spinning Mobileye out into a separate publicly traded company could increase value for Intel shareholders, its parent company said in an announcement that went out late Monday. A source told TechCrunch the IPO is expected to take about six months, a timeline that suggests it has not yet started the typical IPO roadshow process.</p>
<p>A source familiar with Intel&#8217;s plans to list shares of Mobileye <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/intel-list-shares-self-driving-car-unit-mobileye-wsj-2021-12-07/">told Reuters</a> the unit could be valued at more than $50 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported Intel&#8217;s intent to sell shares of Mobileye.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243825" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Intel will remain the majority owner of Mobileye, and the two companies will continue as strategic partners, collaborating on projects as they pursue the growth of computing in the automotive sector,&#8221; according to a statement from the company.</p>
<p>Intel said it will hold onto its majority ownership interest, with no intent to spin off or divest at all. A final decision on the IPO still needs to be reached, and is subject to market conditions, but as the majority stakeholder, Intel&#8217;s plan is to continue to fully consolidate Mobileye.</p>
<p>Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua will continue to lead the same executive team. Intel teams working on lidar and radar development will be aligned under Mobileye, as will Moovit, an Israeli trip planning app that was recently acquired by Intel, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has been a great success. Mobileye has achieved record revenue year-over-year with 2021 gains expected to be more than 40 percent higher than 2020, highlighting the powerful benefits to both companies of our ongoing partnership,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement. “Amnon and I determined that an IPO provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye’s track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its acquisition in 2017, Mobileye has been able to triple annual chip shipments, revenue and headcount, according to Shashua.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our alignment with Intel continues to provide Mobileye with valuable technical resources and support that has yielded strong revenue along with free cash flow that allows us to fund our AV development work from current revenue,&#8221; said Shashua.</p>
<p>The news comes only a few months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/intels-mobileye-rental-giant-sixt-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-germany-next-year/">Mobileye agreed to partner with car rental giant Sixt to launch a robotaxi service in Germany next year</a>. This year, the company has scaled autonomous vehicle testing programs to multiple cities in the U.S., Europe and Asia,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/"> including New York City</a>, and says it has secured 41 new advanced driver assistance system program wins across more than 30 automakers. It also plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ntels-mobileye-teams-with-udelv-to-launch-35000-driverless-delivery-vehicles-by-2028/">35,000 purpose-built driverless delivery vehicles with Udelv</a> by 2028, and has secured <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moovit+mobileye&amp;oq=moovit+mobileye&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.3754j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">multiple deals for mobility-as-a-service programs in 2023</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to Max Q! There was a TON of space news this week so I won&#8217;t ramble too much, other than to remind you that <em>many </em>of the people mentioned below will be at TC Sessions: Space on the 14th and 15th! That includes <strong>Peter Beck</strong>, CEO of Rocket Lab, Nanoracks&#8217; <strong>Jeffrey Manber</strong>, and many, many others.

<h2>Rocket Lab is reimagining rocket design with Neutron launch system</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Rocket Lab finally gave a much-anticipated update on Neutron, its medium-lift launch system, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/rocket-lab-reimagines-rocket-design-with-its-neutron-launch-vehicle/">the company did not disappoint</a>. Neutron features a number of surprising innovations in both operation and development that depart from other rockets of its class &#8212; I&#8217;ll go over a few here.</p>
<p>The first is the material used: Rocket Lab has chosen to go with carbon composites for the body of the rocket, eschewing metal alternatives. This is interesting because SpaceX famously ditched carbon composites for stainless steel for the Starship system, but CEO Peter Beck told me that the lighter structure offers huge advantages in weight and performance.</p>
<p>The other notable alteration I&#8217;ll mention here is the payload fairing. Traditionally, a rocket is stacked vertically, with the second stage sandwiched between the first stage on the bottom and the fairing on the top, like a nose cone. This is not the case with Neutron.</p>
<p>Instead, the company has decided to attach the fairing to the first stage and put the second stage <em>inside </em>it. When the rocket is ready to deploy payload, the fairings will mechanically open, like a weird alien flower or a big claw!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are just a few details on the design &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/rocket-lab-reimagines-rocket-design-with-its-neutron-launch-vehicle/">read the full story for more</a>.</p>

<h2>NASA awards over $400M to Blue Origin, Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman for private space stations</h2>
<p>Big news this week in the world of commercial space stations: NASA has awarded more than $400 million in agreements to three companies to further develop designs for private destinations in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The three companies, which received the awards under the agency’s Commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) Destinations program, are Nanoracks, which received $160 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">&#8220;Starlab&#8221;</a>; Blue Origin, which received $130 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/">&#8220;Orbital Reef&#8221;</a>; and Northrop Grumman for $125.6 million, for a station that does not yet have a flashy name.</p>
<p>This first set of awards will help the companies develop their designs, work that is expected to continue through 2025. There will be a second phase of the program, where NASA intends to certify for human use one or more stations (from this group of companies or other entrants) and ultimately become one of many customers purchasing in-orbit services and use of the stations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 6, 2021! The holiday news slowdown is very much not here yet. With changes at Alibaba, big startup news, SEC queries and a crypto selloff the other day that is still reverberating through markets, it’s busy out there. So, let TechCrunch catch you up! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/alibaba-undergoes-major-management-reshuffle/">Alibaba shuffles its executive makeup:</a> </strong>More changes are afoot at Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which is said by some to be heading toward a delisting of its shares on U.S. exchanges. Didi is already making progress on that front. For Alibaba, the executive rearrangements are material, and speak to changes in how it operates.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/sensetimes-ipo-to-test-market-demand-for-high-growth-high-loss-shares-in-hong-kong/"><strong>SenseTime’s IPO could set tone for future AI listings:</strong></a> China-based SenseTime’s impending Hong Kong IPO could prove key for both AI listings and for high-growth, high-burn Chinese technology companies. If the decoupling of Chinese companies and global markets continues, Hong Kong could become one of just a few possible places for mainland companies to list, so how SenseTime performs matters. So far signals are mixed at best.</li>
<li><strong>The SEC comes knocking:</strong> If you keep tabs on the EV market, you are familiar with Lucid Group. And if you keep tabs on the social media landscape, there’s a chance you are aware of TRUTH Social and the rest of the upcoming offerings from the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/ev-automaker-lucid-group-under-investigation-by-sec/">Lucid is under investigation by the SEC</a>, while the <a href="http://tcrn.ch/3IoU662">Trump media concern’s SPAC partner is being asked questions</a>. Keep an eye on both.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>To kick off our startup coverage today, news from our own Manish Singh that several venture groups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/vcs-eye-investment-in-polygon/">considering buying into the Polygon project</a>, which is built atop the Ethereum blockchain. That a collection of investors is looking to buy tokens isn’t a shock per se, but is indication that crypto really has moved from fringe to the center of the venture capital world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243674" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/everphone-series-c/"><strong>Smartphones as a service?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Turns out it’s a thing. Evidence of that can be found in Berlin-based Everphone raising $65 million in yet another financing round. What does it do? Per TechCrunch reporting, the startup “takes care of the supply, support, repair/replacement and recycling of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) for enterprise customers — billed under a per-user monthly subscription.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/platzi-picks-up-62-million-series-b-to-re-skill-latin-american-professionals/"><strong>Platzi’s edtech model raises even more capital:</strong></a> The Latin American edtech market is not just that &#8212; it’s also a hedge on the future. Platzi CEO Freddy Vega told TechCrunch that with much of the Latin American economy “based on natural resources,” there’s a time crunch to get ready for what’s next. Enter edtech and Platzi’s non-cohort based approach that just raised a huge $62 million Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/"><strong>Cute robots get checks:</strong></a> The somewhat humorously named Serve Robotics has raised $13 million in new capital. Known as an Uber spinout, the startup builds little robots that make deliveries in urban areas. And, yes, its robots are cute. Which matters, I reckon, as otherwise folks would probably tip them over and generally be brats.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/neobank-hatch-series-b/"><strong>Nearside raises $58M for SMB neobanking:</strong></a> While we await the Chime IPO with bated-ish breath, neobanks with more narrow focuses are busy raising capital. This time it&#8217;s Nearside &#8212; once known as Hatch &#8212; which targets small businesses as its core customer demographic. Nearside just added $58 million to its accounts in a Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/dispatch-goods-restaurant-container-reuse/"><strong>Dispatch Goods may dispatch some good:</strong></a> Thanks to its model of reusing containers, limiting the amount of plastic that folks generate in landfills, communities and oceans. It’s a pretty neat idea, and one that is seeing its market move toward it; I think that we are all a bit more ecologically focused than we once were. Right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/"><strong>TradeDepot raises $110M in debt, equity:</strong></a> The African and North American company operates a marketplace, warehouse network and BNPL solution. Which makes it investor catnip, we imagine. Hence its mega new raise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/"><strong>OpenSea hires Lyft’s CFO to be its CFO:</strong></a> Normally when a company hires a CFO and makes it known, we start the IPO countdown. Which brings us to OpenSea, the NFT marketplace, now flush with CFO talent thanks to its pilfering from ride-hailing giant Lyft. Recall that Lyft is public, so its CFO knows a thing or two about going public. To which we must add, please go public OpenSea; we desperately want to see your numbers. We are so, <em>so </em>curious.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Credit Karma, acquired amid COVID chaos, fared in its first year under Intuit</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2237668" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237668" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg" alt="Image of a family, house, piggybank and bags of money stacked on top of coins to represent estate planning." width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1313583110.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=William_Potter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William_Potter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>On the day in February 2020 that Credit Karma planned to announce that it had been acquired by Intuit for more than $7 billion, the stock market tanked, spooked by news that a novel new virus had the potential to start a pandemic.</p>
<p>“I remember waking up and the Dow futures were down something like 600 points because the COVID pieces were starting to hit the market,” Credit Karma CEO Ken Lin said. “I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’”</p>
<p>They did, and they managed to weather the storm. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/how-credit-karma-acquired-amid-covid-chaos-fared-in-its-first-year-under-intuit/">Ryan Lawler spoke with Credit Karma and Intuit executives</a> to get a full picture on how Credit Karma endured a gauntlet of challenges before returning to growth in 2021.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/astra-will-launch-a-rocket-from-cape-canaveral-in-florida-for-the-first-time-in-january/">The private rocket boom continues:</a> </strong>Perhaps we should say that the private rocket push continues its ascent? Boom seems suggestive and not in a nice way. Regardless, Astra will soon launch a rocket from Florida, for the first time since January, it turns out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/doordash-tests-a-full-time-employment-option-in-new-york-as-it-launches-ultra-fast-delivery/"><strong>DoorDash tests full-time delivery workers:</strong></a> The company is working on a faster delivery system in New York, which makes its move to bring some of its delivery workers in-house pretty understandable. How far the model will penetrate the cohorts of DoorDash giggers who brought you dinner yesterday is not clear at this juncture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/toyota-will-build-its-first-us-battery-plant-in-north-carolina/"><strong>Toyota to build batteries in North Carolina:</strong></a> Japanese auto giant intends to build a battery plant in the United States. Good news for folks in favor of more American manufacturing, and indicative, I’d say, of just how big electric vehicles have become in short order.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/apple-partners-with-boys-girls-clubs-of-america-to-launch-a-new-coding-program/"><strong>Apple teams up with Boys and Girls Club to teach coding:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The youth of the nation will learn Javascript, I suppose. “Apple says the new collaboration will give students the chance to create and learn about the basics of app design and development,” TechCrunch reports. We dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/argo-releases-standard-for-how-self-driving-cars-should-act-around-cyclists/"><strong>Argo AI teams up with cyclist group for AV guidelines:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As you have read in Daily Crunch for some months now, the pace at which self-driving projects are dipping their toes into commercial operations is accelerating. Which puts folks atop two-wheeled, self-powered machines in a tricky spot. Folks are going to keep biking. And autonomous vehicle projects are going to keep progressing. Making the two groups play nice — and keep cyclists alive, let’s be clear — is a big job. So, we’re glad to see some work toward finding common ground for cyclist safety.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese government-backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCI) <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Monday</a> that a federal court in Virginia had granted an order allowing the company to take control of the websites and redirect the traffic to Microsoft servers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These malicious websites were being used by a state-sponsored hacking group known as Nickel, or APT15, to gather intelligence from government agencies, think tanks and human rights organizations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn’t name Nickel’s targets, but said the group was targeting organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries. It added that &#8220;there is often a correlation between Nickel’s targets and China’s geopolitical interests.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Microsoft, which has been tracking Nickel since 2016 and <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described</a> it as one of the “most active” hacking groups targeting government agencies, said it observed “highly sophisticated” attacks that installed hard-to-detect malware that facilitates intrusion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/surveillance/">surveillance</a> and data theft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In some cases, Nickel’s attacks used compromised third-party virtual private network (VPN) suppliers and credentials obtained from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phone-spear-phishing/">spear-phishing</a> campaigns, according to Microsoft, and in others, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s own Exchange Server and SharePoint system were used to infiltrate companies. However, Microsoft noted that it has “not observed any new vulnerabilities in Microsoft products as part of these attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Obtaining control of the malicious websites and redirecting traffic from those sites to Microsoft’s secure servers will help us protect existing and future victims while learning more about Nickel’s activities,” </span>wrote Tom Burt<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for customer security and trust.</span> “Our disruption will not prevent Nickel from continuing other hacking activities, but we do believe we have removed a key piece of the infrastructure the group has been relying on for this latest wave of attacks.”</p>
<p class="">In addition to the U.S., Nickel also targeted organizations in Argentina, Barbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Jamaica, Mali, Mexico, Montenegro, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its Digital Crimes Unit, through 24 lawsuits, had taken down more than 10,000 malicious websites used by cybercriminals and almost 600 used by nation-state actors. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/microsoft-domains-covid-19-attacks/">the team took control of malicious web domains used in a large-scale cyberattack</a> that targeted victims in 62 countries with spoofed emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the electric vehicle manufacturer that aims to break up the assembly line in favor of multiple microfactories, is investing $11.5 million to build a high-voltage battery module assembly plant in Charlotte, North Carolina. The plant will provide batteries for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">electric buses</a> and vans produced at the company&#8217;s microfactories in Rock Hill, South Carolina and Charlotte, respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Arrival also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005108/en/%C2%A0Li-Cycle-Partners-with-Arrival-to-Advance-EV-Battery-Recycling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to collaborate with Li-Cycle</a>, a lithium-ion battery recycler, to create a closed-loop EV battery supply chain. Like most other automakers, Arrival is recognizing the reality of supply chain delays and materials shortages and is working to vertically integrate as much of the process as possible, while also maintaining its commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not always part of the plan,&#8221; Katie Blixt, Arrival&#8217;s head of PR and communications in North America, told TechCrunch. &#8220;As we&#8217;re figuring out the production plan and timeline and figuring out what makes sense to bring in-house and add to our vertical integration, we just decided that the best move was for us to be able to assemble these ourselves and have more control over the process.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243683" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the next several months, Arrival will be refitting an existing warehouse in order to start production in the third quarter of 2022, according to Blixt, who noted that Arrival&#8217;s battery chemistry supplier is LG. The plant should have a production capacity of up to 350,000 battery modules per year, which can be used across Arrival&#8217;s different commercial vehicle platforms and can be tailored to suit the customer&#8217;s specific battery requirements, according to the company.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Automakers have battery anxiety, so they&#8217;re taking control of the supply&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/embed/#?secret=UkpUCdqpOs" data-secret="UkpUCdqpOs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Arrival has announced before that it hopes to build 31 microfactories by 2024. So far, it has three planned for 2022; Arrival aims to start production of its buses at Rock Hill in Q2 next year, vans in Bicester, England in Q3 and vans in Charlotte in Q4.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve withdrawn long-term forecasts on microfactory numbers beyond that because the advantage of the microfactory model is that we don&#8217;t have to plan several years in the future and the number will be determined by demand and access to capital,&#8221; said Blixt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever Arrival does start scaling up its microfactories, it will also now scale battery assembly plants alongside them, so it&#8217;s almost an opposite approach to the Tesla gigafactory style of production, said Blixt, noting that Arrival might build multiple regional battery assembly facilities to supply local microfactories.</p>
<p>The battery modules will be software-based and have self-diagnostic capabilities, so if there&#8217;s an issue with one, the module itself can be replaced instead of the entire set of batteries in the vehicle, said Blixt. If the software detects an anomaly, it will send information up to the cloud for Arrival&#8217;s technicians to diagnose and then send instructions back down to Arrival&#8217;s network of outside service providers. The company recently announced partnerships with companies like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valvoline-named-a-network-service-provider-for-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-301435131.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valvoline and Firestone to provide Arrival customers with vehicle maintenance.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) announced in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent filing</a> that it has received questions from the United States government regarding its anticipated combination with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG). TechCrunch covered the SPAC&#8217;s planned combination with the company associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">broadly skeptical of the deal</a>, product goals and general vibe. Since then, a few things have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>In late October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/trump-spac-digital-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reported</a> that Trump was in conversation with DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando before the SPAC was put together. &#8220;In doing so, Mr. Orlando’s SPAC may have skirted securities laws and stock exchange rules, lawyers said,&#8221; per the Times.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/04/2346139/0/en/Trump-Media-Technology-Group-Corp-and-Digital-World-Acquisition-Corp-Announce-1-Billion-PIPE-Investment-in-Committed-Capital-to-Fund-Business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DWAC and TMTG picked up</a> &#8220;subscription agreements for $1 billion in committed capital to be received upon consummation of their business combination&#8221; on December 4, per a release.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the two news items, that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are asking questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the new DWAC filing (emphasis added):</p>
<div align="left">
<blockquote><p><strong>DWAC has received certain preliminary, fact-finding inquiries from regulatory authorities, with which it is cooperating.</strong> Specifically, in late October and in early November 2021, DWAC received a request for information from FINRA, surrounding events (specifically, a review of trading) that preceded the public announcement of the October 20, 2021 Merger Agreement. According to FINRA’s request, the inquiry should not be construed as an indication that FINRA has determined that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred, nor as a reflection upon the merits of the securities involved or upon any person who effected transactions in such securities. Additionally, <strong>in early November 2021, DWAC received a voluntary information and document request from the SEC which sought,<i> inter alia</i>, documents relating to meetings of DWAC’s Board of Directors, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses, the identities of certain investors, and certain documents and communications between DWAC and TMTG.</strong> According to the SEC’s request, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The company stresses, as you read, that it has not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet. But that&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny for a deal that was hard to parse, which has our heads tilting to one side at a rather sharp angle.</p>
<p>The TMTG/DWAC investor presentation was thin on details. And it quickly became apparent that some of the code being used to build TMTG product TRUTH Social <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">was not properly sourced</a>. It&#8217;s all a bit whiffy, frankly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why the SPAC would merge with what appeared to be more of a collection of ideas than a company was a question. How the valuation thereof was decided was also a mystery. As was the list of investors putting the $1 billion infusion together for the deal.</p>
<p>The entire affair is not a good look for SPACs, which already earn a goodish bit of side-eye given their somewhat befuddling mechanism that allows a pre-product company to go public via a less mature structure than is generally permitted. This is the sort of deal that gave SPACs &#8212; blank-check companies &#8212; the name that they had until recently, when they got a rebrand of sorts for a short window of time in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p>More to come on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor will build its first battery factory in the U.S. in North Carolina, the company and state officials confirmed Monday, as more automakers seek to take control of the supply chain with in-house battery manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>Toyota will invest $1.29 billion in the plant, which will be called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (TBMNC), with production anticipated to commence in 2025. That investment is part of a wider pledge to invest $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. through 2030.</p>
<p>Once operational, TBMNC will have four production lines, each capable of manufacturing batteries for around 200,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Toyota’s aim is to expand the factory to at least six production lines, which would produce enough batteries for 1.2 million vehicles per year. The new factory will create around 1,750 new jobs and will use 100% renewable energy to make the batteries, Toyota said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The news comes as Congress mulls a revision to the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, which currently stands at around $7,500 for OEMs that have sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles. A group of Democrats have proposed adding an additional $500 if the vehicle’s battery was made in the U.S., and another $4,500 on top of that for EVs produced in the U.S. by unionized plants.</p>
<p>Toyota has been squarely against the tax credit revision, calling it “blatantly biased” in a letter to legislators. The bill has received support from the big three automakers &#8212; Ford, General Motors and Stellantis &#8212; as well as the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Toyota is just the latest major automaker to announce a battery manufacturing plant, part of a push to stay ahead of potential supply chain squeezes from raw materials or key battery components. As Rebecca Bellan wrote for TechCrunch+, partnerships and joint ventures with battery suppliers &#8212; like GM’s joint venture with LG Chem, dubbed Ultium, or Ford Motor’s agreement with SK Innovation &#8212; show that OEMs are realizing they need to take control of the supply.</p>
