<p>With one fell swoop, WarnerMedia eradicated the status quo in Hollywood, turning its 2021 feature film schedule on its head. Well, not quite. By moving 2021’s theatrical releases to both physical and digital theaters, the AT&amp;T affiliate gave us a reason to sign up for its HBOMax streaming service. With a simultaneous window of one month per title, the idea is that the vaccines will govern the timetable for viable return to movies plus popcorn.</p>
<p>Streaming has picked the lock on our path to the future. Even Donald Trump thinks so. Faced with open refusal by the networks to carry his rants about the election, he’s taken to Facebook Live to produce “press conferences” with his own cameras and no press. These shows are designed to fuel contributions of (so far) 200 million dollars to fund what in essence will be a nonstop infomercial campaign for the 2024 election. One problem: I don’t think it will work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, millions of Americans will begin to turn working from home into living through work. Digital networks like Zoom are becoming a superhighway for transforming ideas into post-pandemic realities. As the vaccines take root, we’ll inexorably restore the dream of mobility, the feeling of hitting the open road in search of our dreams. Only this time, we’re taking our families, friends, and coworkers with us. The rise of digital devices and notifications is disrupting the old business models and replacing them with next best step workflow.</p>
<p>We know what the office gives us: a place for hallway conversations that harness the elastic essence of the team. It’s based on inspiration, camaraderie, shared values, and just plain good timing. Don’t believe me? Ask anybody how their parents met. In the rush to virtualize the hallway conversation, we’re missing the fact that it’s really the only thing that’s working by default. The notification channel dominates our attention, and in aggregate who we give that to creates successful business outcomes.</p>
<p>Zoom is a perfect example of hallway serendipity. A brain dead simple on boarding process starts by clicking on a notification. If you have the Zoom client installed you&#8217;re in; if you don&#8217;t the download starts, and then you&#8217;re in. Zoom takes care of what device you&#8217;re using, what software tools are necessary to gather multiple people together across time zones and latencies, and provides in our case the recording and switching tools to stream the meeting across the network. If you can&#8217;t make the scene in real-time you can time shift until later.</p>
<p>How does Hollywood compete with that? The short answer is they don’t. HBO is saying the old way of business is over. It may seem like it will return to the good old days of the Saturday afternoon matinee (and it will) but the way it will happen is infused with digital. If you’re embedded in the Zoom economy you first hear about things over that channel. News, pitches, reminders, delivery arrivals, early voting, everything that can most efficiently alert you will succeed. If the networks you use produce effective service and empathetic trustworthy processes, they will be rewarded with your attention.</p>
<p>HBO has decided to run a vaccine trial where they give out a dose of the what will be alongside a placebo, what has been working up til now. Same product, two different experiences. What they’re really saying is: at some point, we’ll feel safe enough to return to the theaters. But will we? Sure, for the big experiences, the blockbusters, the roar of laughter and shared relief of having made it through. But that blockbuster is not the experience we crave, and the new streaming shared water cooler experience has its own joys and power.</p>
<p>How else do you explain the success of streaming shows like The Queen’s Gambit, where millions of us watch a small story about a young girl’s path to chess stardom. A chess movie? You betcha. Or The Crown, which blatantly makes up stories about the Royal Family with an underlying central truth that the show’s writer proclaims. To paraphrase, if I tell the essential truth about these people, I can get away with making up the dialogue. These shows are the thing the blockbusters can’t deliver, the emotional truth that soothes us as we shelter in place. HBO is betting on that model, plus the blockbusters when they’re safe again. Make America Safe Again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Subscribe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>So very much happened this week. If you are just catching up, the Equity crew spent good time this week parsing through a host of recent early-stage venture capital rounds; if that’s your jam, head <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/what-about-30-billion-under-30/">here</a>. Today for the newsletter The Exchange is digging into later-stage news, though smaller startups will still make an appearance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We begin with notes on a company that was net-new to me when I met it earlier this week: <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>. Now north of $200 million in revenue, the company is a quiet giant and, notably, has not taken venture capital funding along its path to scale.</p>
<p>Given how frequently conversation in the tech press concerns funding news it was a refreshing break to talk to Nextiva about how it managed to scale without leaning on high-burn growth and external capital.</p>
<p>Chatting with CEO and co-founder Tomas Gorny, I got to dig a little under the skin of the company’s history. It goes a little something like this: After moving to California in 1996 at the age of 20, Gorny eventually founded a web hosting company in 2001 after working for tech companies during the dot-com boom. The web hosting company wound up selling to another company <a href="https://www.pehub.com/endurance-buys-ipower/">called Endurance International in 2007</a>, which sold as a combined entity for around a billion dollars in 2011, later going public before <a href="https://clearlake.com/endurance-international-group-announces-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-l-p-for-9-50-per-share/">being taken private</a> last month for $3 billion &#8212; you can read this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/weebly-web-host-endurance/">TechCrunch piece that mentions Endurance from 2010</a> for a bit of the historical record.</p>
<p>Gorny founded Nextiva in 2008, focused on what it describes today as “UcaaS,” or unified communications as a service. The startup grew to about $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), at which point it ran into issues with a third-party system that would integrate hardware, and support and services software, which sparked a shift in its thinking. The company set out to build a platform.</p>
<p>Nextiva expanded horizontally, adding CRM software, analytics and other functionality to its broader suite as it scaled. And it grew efficiently; starting with money from its founding team, Gorny told TechCrunch that even if he had used someone else’s money, he would have built the company in the same manner.</p>
<p>The platform switch was expensive, with Nextiva calculating that it spent $100 million on the project, telling TechCrunch that it might have been able to grow more quickly in the short-term if it had only focused on its original offerings.</p>
<p>The platform work that Nextiva has spent so much time and money on is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/02/2138418/0/en/Nextiva-Launches-NextOS-Platform-to-Bring-Communications-Business-Applications-to-All-Companies.html">now in the market</a>, and after scaling <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nextiva-ceo-tomas-gornys-rags-to-riches-life-story-2016-6">from $100 million ARR in 2016</a> to $200 million this year, the company now considers itself to have completed the evolution to platform status. Which raised my hackles slightly, as quite literally every company wants to be a platform. And nearly none of them are.</p>
<p>Gorny, however, swayed me somewhat with his thinking on the matter. Nextiva built a suite of products, he explained, but wasn’t a platform at that point. Correct. However, he argued that the company became one when it built a system that created a shared pool of customer data for all its apps and services, allowing Nextiva to build faster on top of its foundational layer. By the definition of platform that precedes tech’s abuse of the word, that seems fair.</p>
<p>What’s next for Nextiva? Growing at more than 30% a year, it could go public. Given that it is self-funded, it cannot have horrorshow cash burn by definition and meet requisite benchmarks for an IPO. Even more, while Gorny did highlight that being private allowed his company to accelerate and decelerate growth when it wanted to focus more on product work, I got the impression that Nextiva wants to be better-known. And an IPO would help with that.</p>
<p>2021 is said to be a coming ground for a stampede of unicorn IPOs. Perhaps some of those debuts will be dark horses as well.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>We have three themes this week for our discussion of the broader startup market that warrant discussion: AI fundraising, fintech and private-market liquidity.</p>
<p>On the AI front, it’s been a busy sector of late, especially amongst the later-stages. Ohio-based healthcare AI company <a href="https://oliveai.com/media/olive-attracts-additional-225-5mm-investment-to-fast-track-ai-workforce-for-healthcare/">Olive raised $225.5 million</a>, or about half of the $456 million that it has raised to date. Olive is a unicorn, to boot, with <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> pegging its new valuation at $1.50 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see a win for the Midwest. But Olive was hardly alone. Scale AI also raised a huge chunk of money, this time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">$155 million at a $3.5 billion valuation</a>. Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/">raised $100 million at a valuation north of $1 billion</a>. And elsewhere in the AI startup realm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ai-construction-startup-versatile-raises-a-20m-series-a/">Versatile raised $20 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ultimate-ai-scores-20m-for-a-supportive-approach-to-customer-service-automation/">ultimate.ai raised $20 million</a>. Busy!</p>
<p>Scooting along. Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">dropped a host of banking-as-a-service tooling</a>, shifting the richly valued payments company from its initial niche into a much broader &#8212; and potentially lucrative &#8212; domain.</p>
<p>So, doom for smaller startups working in the same problem space? Not if they have anything to say about. Chris Dean, the CEO of <a href="https://treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime</a>, a startup that I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/treasury-prime-raises-9m-to-bring-its-banking-apis-to-market/">written about</a> that offers banking services via an API, wrote in to The Exchange, saying that the “most significant signal [from the Stripe news] is to banks” that they “need an open banking API to stay relevant.”</p>
<p>And Dean reckons that as every fintech has multiple vendors for different things, there will be room for many vendors per major fintech served by banking-via-an-API services, noting that Treasury Prime has “clients who use Marqeta, Galileo, and Stripe” for their banking needs.</p>
<p>Let’s see; but the Stripe news <em>is</em> big news all the same. And the new updates explain the IPO wait, I reckon. Better to go public when it has these new pieces driving growth. So much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">for our notes last week</a> that were censorious concerning its IPO lag.</p>
<p>Finally, Carta X. I am bursting with excitement about this bit of news. Carta, which helps startups manage their cap table and employees handle their equity stakes, is building an exchange of sorts that should bring more liquidity &#8212; and therefore more pricing signal, and, pray, transparency &#8212; to the private markets. It’s coming early next year. <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/liquidity-is-coming-761a9140dedd">More here</a>.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>We’re low on room, so just three final things to close out this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale Venture Partners raised a new fund <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scale-venture-partners-announces-close-of-new-600-million-fund-301185735.html">worth $600 million</a>. That’s up 50% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/scale-venture-partners-has-a-new-400-million-fund-to-invest-in-enterprise-companies/">from its last fund</a>.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/cailen/status/1334554579862573056">this note</a> on a mistake that Slack might have made is worth pondering.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to close, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/howard">Yext CEO Howard Lerman</a> about its recent earnings report, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641539-yext-eps-beats-0_06-beats-on-revenue">bested near-term expectations</a> regarding its Q3 results, but <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641751-yext-slumps-15-after-target-lowered-da-davidson">left investors wanting more</a> when it came to Q4 guidance.</p>
<p>Chatting with Lerman &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">joined TechCrunch for an Extra Crunch Live</a> the other week &#8212; I got the lay of the land. On one hand, Yext’s push into offering search services is working, driving new logo lands, and helping it trim costs in its sales process. On the other, the world is reentering a shutdown, which means that the company is seeing upsell weakness in certain geographies, denting its near-term net retention results, a key driver of growth for software companies.</p>
<p>Now, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yext" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yext">Yext <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a single public SaaS company, so I don’t want to over-index on its results too much, but the company’s honest assessment of the uncertainties that it faces in terms of near-term growth cannot be unique to its operations &#8212; something to consider as we ask startups about their Q4 growth in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Yext appears in the midst of an intelligent product expansion while parts of the market it sells into struggle with a macro hangover. This is the situation that startups say is best to weather while private. Perhaps Yext will become a working case for how to navigate the same circumstance while public.</p>
<p>Hugs, and thank golly for the weekend’s respite,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to Human Capital, a weekly newsletter that looks at the latest in diversity and inclusion in tech, as well as labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Google made headlines a couple of times for its workplace issues, while Coinbase found itself back in the news after the New York Times reported on alleged issues of racism and discrimination at the cryptocurrency startup. On the more positive side, however, Nasdaq proposed to the SEC some diversity requirements for public companies. </span></p>

<h3><b>Alleged racial discrimination at Coinbase </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week kicked off with news about cryptocurrency company Coinbase’s diversity issues. Specifically, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYT reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a myriad of internal complaints alleging discriminatory treatment against Black employees. Here’s a key snippet from the story:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 15 people worked at Coinbase, the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency start-up, where they represented roughly three-quarters of the Black employees at the 600-person company. Before leaving in late 2018 and early 2019, at least 11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment, five people with knowledge of the situation said.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Pinterest executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, alleging they enabled a culture of discrimination. The complaint also alleges that culture of discrimination has harmed Pinterest’s reputation and led to financial harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement to Fast Company, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90581144/pinterest-lawsuit-racial-gender-discrimination"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pinterest’s leadership and Board take their fiduciary duties seriously and are committed to continuing our efforts to help ensure that Pinterest is a place where all of our employees feel included and supported,” said a Pinterest spokesperson when reached for comment. “We believe the actions we’ve initiated as well as the ongoing independent review regarding our culture, policies, and practices will help us achieve our goal of building a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.”</span></p>
<h3><b>NLRB alleges Google unlawfully surveilled employees and violated other labor laws</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Labor Relations Board this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued a complaint against </span><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after investigating the firing of several employees last November. The complaint alleges Google violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by </span><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged “its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,” the complaint states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Google’s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2082620" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082620" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082620" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082620" class="wp-caption-text">SAN FRANCISCO, CA &#8211; SEPTEMBER 07: Google AI Research Scientist Timnit Gebru speaks onstage during Day 3 of TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018 at Moscone Center on September 7, 2018 in San Francisco, California.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports. According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email in question, </span><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained by Casey Newton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discussed how Gebru was disappointed in how her organization had, “After all this talk,” only hired 14% or so women this year, she wrote. She pointed to how Samy Bengio, who leads a group of researchers inside the Google Brain team, hired 39% women but that there is no incentive for him to do so. She added:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gebru’s email also discussed issues with silencing marginalized voices, how her expertise has been dismissed and how she’s felt gaslighted by Google.</span></p>
<h3><b>Instacart outlines its healthcare subsidies for workers in California</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Prop 22, gig workers promised healthcare subsidies for their workers. </span><a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/delivering-for-california-shoppers-healthcare-subsidy-e345dae0878"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Instacart provided some more detail on what that means in practice. TL;DR is that it will be available on a quarterly basis to shoppers who work an average of 15 hours or more per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who average between 15 to 25 hours per week will be eligible for 50% of the average contribution. Those that average 25 hours or more will be eligible for 100% of the average contribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s important to note that those with employer-sponsored healthcare, Medicare and Medicaid are not eligible for subsidies.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nasdaq</b> <b>wants to require diversity at the board level</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-advance-diversity-through-new-proposed-listing-requirements-2020-12-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq filed a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt new rules around diversity. If approved, the SEC would require companies listed on the Nasdaq to publicly report the diversity of its board of directors. The rule would also require many companies to have at least two diverse directors &#8212; one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either a person from an underrepresented minority group or as LGBTQ+. If a company does not meet that requirement, they would need to explain why.</span></p>

<h2>Virtual fundraising is here to stay</h2>
<p>Connie Loizos sat down with Jason Green of leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/">enterprise-focused firm Emergence Capital to get his view of SPACs</a>, and how they are likely to be used next year and beyond. But early-stage startups, don&#8217;t miss his affirmation of Zoom meetings as part of the fundraising process going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say that over the last five years, we’ve made almost a total transition. Now we’re very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we’re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they’ve started their companies or gotten seed financing. The last three investments that we made were all relationships that [date back] a year to 18 months before we started engaging in the actual financing process with them. I think that’s what’s required to build a relationship and the conviction, because financings are happening so fast.</p>
<p>I think we’re going to actually do more investments this year than we maybe have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we’ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction, and then in this market environment, Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we’re willing to invest in. We’re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Edtech looks to the future</h2>
<p>Every level of education was forced online by the pandemic this year, at least temporarily. While the children might be back in the classroom already, higher education and corporate education are still booming remotely. Natasha Mascarenhas analyzed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/as-edtech-grows-cash-rich-some-lessons-for-early-stage/">latest market changes for Extra Crunch</a>, and put together a panel of industry leaders for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">a special Thanksgiving edition of Equity</a>. Here&#8217;s more about what you&#8217;ll find on the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>For this Equity Dive, we zero onto one part of that conversation: Edtech’s impact on higher education. We brought together <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udacity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="udacity">Udacity </a>co-founder and Kitty Hawk CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/sebastianthrun?lang=en">Sebastian Thrun</a>, Eschaton founder and college dropout <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imdilick/">Ian Dilick</a>, and Cowboy Ventures investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> to answer our biggest questions.</p>
<p>Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">How the state of remote school is leading to gap years among students.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A framework for how to think of higher education’s main three products (including which is most defensible over time).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What learnings we can take from this COVID-19 experiment on remote schooling to apply to the future.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why edtech is flocking to the notion of life-long learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The reality of who self-paced learning serves — and who it leaves out.</span></li>

<h2>How to price your SaaS product for a bottoms-up growth strategy</h2>
<p>SaaS is continuing to be reshaped by consumer internet techniques, with top companies of our era competing through word-of-mouth growth versus incumbent <em>sales forces</em>. The revenue model must be precise for this to scale, though. In a guest post for Extra Crunch, Caryn Marooney and David Cahn of Coatue lay out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/bottom-up-saas-a-framework-for-mapping-pricing-to-customer-value/">strategic framework for how to price your bottoms-up SaaS product</a> the right way for the market. Called &#8220;MAP,&#8221; for Metrics, Activity and People, it helps you sort your product against the actual ways that people are trying to use and pay for it. Here&#8217;s how they describe the A:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Activity</strong>: How do your customers really use your product and how do they describe themselves? Are they creators? Are they editors? Do different customers use your product differently? Instead of metrics, a key anchor for pricing may be the different roles users have within an organization and what they want and need in your product. If you choose to anchor on activity, you will need to align feature sets and capabilities with usage patterns (e.g., creators get access to deeper tooling than viewers, or admins get high privileges versus line-level users). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Figma — Editors versus viewers: Free to view, starts changing after two edits.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Monday — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10-$20/month.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Smartsheet — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10+/month.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Happiest Season,&#8221; a new film on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> feels like a traditional, Christmas-themed romantic comedy — with one important exception.</p>
<p>The movie stars Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis as Abby and Harper, a lesbian couple who are visiting Harper&#8217;s parents for the holidays. As they drive back to Harper&#8217;s childhood home, she makes a big confession: Despite what she&#8217;s told Abby previous, she never actually came out to her parents, which means Abby has to spend five days simultaneously ingratiating herself with Harper&#8217;s family while hiding the true nature of their relationship.</p>
<p>As we discuss on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;Happiest Season&#8221; can feel predictable or even formulaic at times. But in some ways, that&#8217;s what makes it so worthwhile — it demonstrates how a broad, crowd-pleasing comedy can just happen to star queer characters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the frequent laugh-out-loud moments, the movie also feels surprisingly honest in its depiction of how hurtful Harper&#8217;s secrecy can be,  and it enters surprisingly painful and emotional territory as it approaches the end.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;Happiest Season,&#8221; we also name our favorite Christmas movies and discuss the news that that Warner Bros. will release its entire 2021 slate (including &#8220;Dune&#8221; and &#8220;The Matrix 4&#8221;) on HBO Max <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">at the same time that the movies are released in theaters</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s top leadership positions skew white and male with just 4% of those roles going to Black employees, according to the company&#8217;s first <a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf">diversity and inclusion report</a> released Friday.</p>
<p>The report shows that overall the company, which has factories in California, Nevada and New York, has a workforce that includes women as well as Black, Hispanic and Asian employees. Some 60% of its workforce is made up of people who are Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American and Pacific Islander. However, the vast majority of its workforce is male at 79%. That male representation ticks up to 83% when looking at leadership positions. It also gets whiter with 59% of leadership positions held by white people.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the stats of its U.S. workforce</strong>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black employees</strong>: 10% of workforce. This group has experienced a 60% increase in representation in management with 4% holding &#8220;director level and above&#8221; roles. Some 12% of its new hires in 2020 are Black and African American, a 9% increase from the previous year. Black employees received 10% of promotions in 2020, an 11% increase from 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Asian employees</strong>: 21% of workforce. Some 25% of Asian employees hold leadership positions.  Asian employees comprise 20% of all new hires and 23% of all promotions — a 15% increase from last year.</li>
<li><strong>Hispanic and Latinx employees</strong>: 22% of workforce and 4% of Tesla&#8217;s Director level and above employees. Hispanic and Latinx employees represented 24% of all promotions this year — a 14% increase. About 27% of all new hires in 2020 were Hispanic and Latinx.</li>
<li><strong>Women</strong>:  represent 21% of Tesla&#8217;s overall U.S. workforce and 23% of all promotions &#8212; a 5% increase from last year. Women hold 17% of &#8220;Director&#8221; and &#8220;Vice President&#8221; positions. In 2020, nearly 25% of all U.S. hires have been women.</li>
<li><strong>Men</strong>: represent 79% of its workforce in the United States and hold 83% of leadership positions.</li>
<li><strong>Veterans</strong>: represent 4% of its U.S. workforce.</li>
<li>Additional groups: a designation that Tesla gives to employees who Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and other Pacific Islander or multiracial, represent 7% of its workforce and 1% of leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tesla did not provide additional details on retention of its minority workforce, information that can provide insight into the company&#8217;s culture and whether its efforts at inclusion are successful. The report didn&#8217;t release data on how many of its employees have disabilities. And while Tesla mentions LGBTQ employees receiving support at the company, there is no breakdown of how many are employed there or hold leadership positions.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged it had &#8220;work to do&#8221; to improve its numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,&#8221; the company said in its report, one of several areas it is seeking employment. The report added that Tesla is &#8220;taking active steps&#8221; to increase outreach to women and build an inclusive culture that supports their development and retention. &#8220;Increasing women&#8217;s representation at all levels, especially in leadership, is a top priority in 2021,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Tesla listed a few efforts to attract and retain women and minorities such as recruiting at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and expanding its internship program. However, the company didn&#8217;t provide targets or a timeline to reaching its goal to improve its diversity and inclusion metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in consumer spending in 2019.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.</p>
<p>This week, Apple and Google announced their editorially curated lists detailing the best apps of the year, and Apple also revealed those that were downloaded the most. Apple also made a notable new hire for an App Store role and opened up its anticipated App Store Small Business Program to developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Google</a> released their &#8220;best apps of 2020&#8221; year-end lists and there were some similarities between the two, as well as some differences. Both companies&#8217; lists reflected the tough and stressful year 2020 has been, with everyone being stuck at home during a pandemic that changed how we worked, attended school, connected with friends and family, and entertained ourselves.</p>
<p>Apple and Google, as a result, both selected at least one &#8220;de-stressing&#8221; app among their year-end winners. In Apple&#8217;s case, it was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/endel-focus-sleep-relax/id1346247457">Endel</a>, an iOS app that won for Apple Watch App of the Year. Google, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">awarded</a> sleep app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.loona&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Loóna</a> the title of best app of the year.</p>
<p>Disney+ also made both Apple and Google&#8217;s lists, the former as Apple TV App of the Year and the latter as the User&#8217;s Choice for app of the year. The new streaming service was a godsend for families with younger children, who often struggled in 2020 to keep kids entertained. New releases like Onward and Mulan in 2020 helped give families something to look forward to, while Marvel and Star Wars content, including new series &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; were hits with streamers, as well.</p>
<p>Another pandemic-prompted choice was Zoom, which won as iPad App of the Year. Though Zoom was around before the coronavirus outbreak, it&#8217;s now become a part of our everyday lexicon as an interchangeable term for &#8220;online video meeting&#8221; &#8212; as in, &#8220;let&#8217;s do a zoom call about that.&#8221; The iPad app at least made these endless virtual meetings a little less painless.</p>
<p>And home workout companion <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wakeout-active-breaks/id1242116567">Wakeout!</a> become Apple&#8217;s iPhone app of the year, as most people gave up the gym due to coronavirus risks. The app&#8217;s quick one-minute breaks helped users stay moving, even when stuck at home for days on the couch or working on their laptop in bed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, gacha-based action role-playing game Genshin Impact won as &#8220;best game&#8221; of the year on both Apple and Google&#8217;s lists. While a cynical take is that the app stores wanted to point users to a huge moneymaker &#8212; the game <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/genshin-impact-first-two-months-revenue">reportedly earned</a> $245 million its first month and nearly $400 million in two months on mobile &#8212; it also highlights consumers&#8217; desire for console-like experiences on mobile.</p>
<p>The game, however, has been heavily <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/genshin-impact-gacha-backlash/">criticized</a> for its gacha game monetization techniques, which though common to games in China, Japan and South Korea, are basically gambling mechanics. And addictive ones at that. But as a Wired report noted, some of this comes down to cultural differences. U.S. users grew up on cartridge games, not arcade games, where you were constantly inserting more money to keep playing. Western users just aren&#8217;t as comfortable with this &#8220;spend to keep playing&#8221; business model, which they feel is predatory.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s other top apps of the year included perennial favorite Fantastical as Apple’s Mac App of the Year; Legends of Runeterra as iPad Game of the Year; Disco Elysium as Mac Game of the Year; Dandara Trials of Fear as Apple TV Game of the Year; and Sneaky Sasquatch as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s list also included SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off as users&#8217; choice for best game, and it highlighted a variety of top titles in various gaming subgenres in a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial_collection/promotion_topic_bestof2020_games_hub">dedicated section of its Play Store</a>.</p>
<h3>2020&#8217;s most downloaded apps</h3>
<p>Apple also gave a peek into the &#8220;best&#8221; apps of the year, as determined by app downloads. The pandemic played a role here as well, making Zoom the most-downloaded iPhone app of 2020.</p>
<p>Also of note, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-year-on-tiktok-top-100">TikTok</a> was the biggest social media app by downloads, ahead of all the Facebook-owned apps making the list, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Square&#8217;s Cash App hit No. 10, as the pandemic saw increased demand for contactless payments and direct giving to people in need.</p>

<p>Some people don&#8217;t trust to-do lists, reminders or calendar notifications to always get the job done. When there&#8217;s something we <em>really</em> need to remember, we stick it directly on our home screen. (Okay, this one may only appeal to a small niche of scatterbrained users like me.) But if you have, in the past, also designed your own temporary wallpaper just so you won&#8217;t forget a super critical appointment, the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.si.heynote">Heynote</a>, (hat tip to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/01/heynote-turns-your-wallpaper-into-a-personalized-to-do-list/#ap-lightbox">Android Police</a>!) might help. Instead of a widget or reminder, this app lets you put custom text directly on your home screen as a custom wallpaper. Doctor appt. at 11 AM? You can&#8217;t forget it when it&#8217;s there every single time you look at your phone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think there are some companies that have a lot of COVID tailwind."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says that chats about enterprise software have to be boring? They don&#8217;t, we learned during our conversation earlier this week with <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/team/jai-das-managing-director/">Sapphire&#8217;s Jai Das</a>, a pleasant time that touched on a host of topics including startup sectors, his investing group&#8217;s capital base and, of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-slumps-8-5-as-its-post-slack-selloff-continues/">the Slack-Salesforce deal</a>.</p>
<p>Our conversation took place about an hour before the deal was formally announced, but the tea leaves had been read by the market far in advance, so we were able to chat about it as if it was already consummated. Which it became a little while later.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Our conversation with Das was part of our Extra Crunch Live series, which you can learn more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">here</a>. If you&#8217;re not a member, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">head here to get started</a>. Extra Crunch Live has previously hosted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/why-bessemers-byron-deeter-thinks-saas-companies-could-grow-even-faster-in-2021/">Bessemer&#8217;s Byron Deeter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/10/sequoia-roelof-botha-extra-crunch-live/">Sequoia&#8217;s Roelof Botha</a>, among others.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The whole chat with Das was interesting and good, but his comments explaining why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sale to the larger CRM giant stuck with me all week. Using <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition of MuleSoft (a company in which Das invested) as a prism, here&#8217;s how the venture capitalist discussed the plusses and minuses of selling to a bigger company.</p>
<p>After noting that MuleSoft might have been able to earn a larger revenue multiple as an independent company in today&#8217;s markets than it managed by selling to Salesforce, Das then detailed the sort of boost that a huge company can bring to one that is merely big (quote has been edited and condensed):</p>
<blockquote><p>Going into your question about Salesforce and Slack, Salesforce, like any large company, does add a lot of value. When I talked to [former MuleSoft CEOs] Simon [Parmett] and Greg [Schott], they were astonished how much account control these large companies have with CIOs and CMOs.</p>
<p>MulesSoft would be beating on the door to get a meeting with the CIO and it wouldn&#8217;t happen. And you know, the Salesforce management team would just make one phone call, and Simon and Greg would be presenting to the CEO on down.</p>
<p>So I think that is the thing that people forget, that these large companies have so much ability to increase your sales velocity with large accounts, [so] it makes a lot of sense for some of these [smaller] companies to end up in Salesforce or SAP or Oracle, or WorkDay.</p></blockquote>
<p>So perhaps Slack will find more oomph under Salesforce&#8217;s auspices than it could as a solo project. We spent the majority of our time talking about startups and smaller companies, so hit the jump for the full video and a few more quotes I transcribed for you.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founder Mike Cagney is always pushing the envelope, and investors love him for it. Not long after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html?_r=0">sexual harassment allegations</a> prompted him to leave SoFi, the personal finance company that he cofounded in 2011, he raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/sofi-founder-mike-cagney-is-back-with-a-new-startup-and-50-million-in-funding-too/">$50 million</a> for a new lending startup called <a href="https://www.figure.com/#about">Figure</a> that has since raised at least <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191205005276/en/Figure-Closes-Series-C-Round-of-103-Million-to-Expand-Lending-Products-and-Executive-Hires">$225 million</a> from investors and was valued a year ago at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Now, Cagney is trying to do something unprecedented with Figure, which says it uses a blockchain to more quickly facilitate home equity, mortgage refinance, and student and personal loan approvals. The company has applied for a national bank charter in the U.S., wherein it would not take FDIC-insured deposits but it could take uninsured deposits of over $250,000 from accredited investors.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? The approach, <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FCyo9xlA1MAJ:https://www.americanbanker.com/news/a-fintechs-novel-bank-charter-application-draws-industrys-ire+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">as American Banker explains it</a>, would bring regulatory benefits. As it reported earlier this week, &#8220;Because Figure Bank would not hold insured deposits, it would not be subject to the FDIC’s oversight. Similarly, the absence of insured deposits would prevent oversight by the Fed under the Bank Holding Company Act. That law imposes restrictions on non-banking activities and is widely thought to be a deal-breaker for tech companies where banking would be a sidelight.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, if approved, Figure could pave the way for a lot of fintech startups &#8212; and other retail companies that want to wheel and deal in lucrative financial products without the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board or the FDIC &#8212; to nab non-traditional bank charters.</p>
<p>As Michelle Alt, whose year-old <a href="https://www.klaros.com/">financial advisory firm</a> helped Figure with its application, tells AB: &#8220;This model, if it’s approved, wouldn’t be for everyone. A lot of would-be banks want to be banks specifically to have more resilient funding sources.&#8221; But if it’s successful, she adds, &#8220;a lot of people will be interested.”</p>
<p>One can only guess at what the ripple effects would be, though the Bank of Amazon wouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone who follows the company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the strategy would seemingly be a high-stakes, high-reward development for a smaller outfit like Figure, which could carry on far more freely than banks traditionally but that would also be operating without a safety net for itself or its customers. The most glaring danger would be a bank run, wherein those accredited individuals who are today willing to lend money to the platform at high interest rates begin demanding their money back at the same time. (It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-indy.4.14456887.html">happens</a>.)</p>
<p>Either way, Cagney might find a receptive audience right now with Brian Brooks, a longtime Fannie Mae executive who served as Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer for two years before jumping this spring to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an agency that ensures that national banks and federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p>Brooks was made acting head of the agency in May and green-lit one of the first national charters to go to a fintech, Varo Money, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-varo-money-gets-green-light-to-become-bank-11596207033">this past summer</a>. In late October, the OCC also granted SoFi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-bank-charter/fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W">preliminary, conditional approval</a> over its own application for a national bank charter.</p>
<p>While Brooks isn&#8217;t commenting on speculation around Figure&#8217;s application, in July, <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/occ-controller-brian-brooks-special-purpose-charters-unbundling/586155/">during a Brookings Institution event</a>, he reportedly commented about trade groups&#8217; concerns over his efforts to grant fintechs and payments companies charters, saying: &#8220;I think the misunderstanding that some of these trade groups are operating under is that somehow this is going to trigger a lighter-touch charter with fewer obligations, and it&#8217;s going to make the playing field un-level . . . I think it&#8217;s just the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher Cole, executive vice president at the trade group <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.icba.org/">Independent Community Bankers of America</a>, doesn&#8217;t seem persuaded. Earlier this week, he voiced concerns about Figure&#8217;s bank charter application to AB, adding that he suspects that Brooks &#8220;wants to approve this quickly before he leaves office.”</p>
<p>Perhaps so. Brooks&#8217;s days are likely numbered. Last month, he was <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526425-trump-to-nominate-brooks-as-comptroller-of-the-currency">nominated</a> by President Donald to a full five-year term leading the federal bank regulator and is currently awaiting Senate confirmation. But the move &#8212; designed to slow down the incoming Biden administration &#8212; could be undone by President-elect Joe Biden, who can <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526425-trump-to-nominate-brooks-as-comptroller-of-the-currency">fire the comptroller of the currency at will</a> and appoint an acting replacement to serve until his nominee is confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Even still, Cole&#8217;s suggestion is that Brooks still has enough time to figure out a path forward for Figure &#8212; and, if its novel charter application is approved, and it stands up to legal challenges &#8212; a lot of other companies, too.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Slack and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> execs explain their big acquisition</strong></p>
<p>After Salesforce announced this week that it&#8217;s acquiring Slack for $27.7 billion, Ron Miller spoke to Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/why-slack-and-salesforce-execs-think-theyre-better-together/">learn more about the deal</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butterfield claimed that Slack will remain relatively independent within Salesforce, allowing the team to &#8220;do more of what we were already doing.&#8221; He also insisted that all the talk about competing with Microsoft Teams is &#8220;overblown.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pandemic has meant we leave our homes far less often, and that means fending for ourselves when it comes to coffee. But too many of us have old, cheap coffee makers or worse, pod-based ones at home. Here are the best ways to elevate your coffee game or delight the java lover in your life.</p>

<h1>Superior drip coffee makers</h1>
<p>Every grocery store sells a cheap drip coffee maker that does the job adequately, but if anyone is going to use a device every day, it should be something they look forward to, not the bare minimum.</p>
<p>That said, a coffee maker shouldn&#8217;t be an IQ test — you have to operate it before you&#8217;ve had your coffee, after all. I personally find the ones with touchscreens and apps add nothing but new ways to get it wrong. So I tested a few coffee makers that balance quality with simplicity, and after a few weeks of jitters here are my favorites.</p>
<h2><strong>For the industrial design appreciator: OXO 8-cup coffee maker</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=768,621 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=1536,1243 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=2048,1657 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, well-thought-out design</li>
<li>Lots of actually useful features</li>
<li>Thermal carafe included</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-cup brewing is a bit over-complicated</li>
<li>Could be more coffee-efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>OXO&#8217;s reputation as a kitchen goods designer is well deserved, but I often find their items a bit much for the job. Not so with the 8-cup coffee maker, which manages to balance thoughtful design with simplicity and quality. I can say with confidence: if you aren&#8217;t sure which coffee maker to get&#8230; get this one.</p>
<p>The OXO 8-cup is the (obviously) smaller alternative to the 9-cup, losing the ability to schedule brewing but gaining simpler operation and a single-cup option using a separate, Kalita-compatible basket. The lids of the reservoir and basket area flip up (the latter allowing condensed water to flow safely into the filter) and the basket itself sits securely but pops out easily.</p>
<p>The coffee is uniformly good; I would say as good but slightly less strong than the KBGV below. It flows directly into a thermal carafe with a dedicated hole in the top, simplifying even that part. Pretty much everything about this machine is made to simplify and foolproof itself, making the brewing process extremely reliable.</p>
<p>I honestly struggled to find any complaints, but I would say that the necessity of keeping a second basket that uses a different filter type, then adjusting the various bits so that you can slip the mug in, etc., is arguably more trouble than it&#8217;s worth. But the capability for single-cup brewing is there and doesn&#8217;t take away from the rest at all.</p>
<p>It also recommends somewhat more grounds per cup than the KBGV, not a crazy amount but enough that you&#8217;ll probably get one less pot out of a standard 16 oz bag of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $170 <a href="https://www.oxo.com/8-cup-coffee-maker.html">from OXO</a></p>
<h2><strong>For the FBI stakeout: Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined retro-institutional look</li>
<li>Strong, reliable brew</li>
<li>Automatic hot plate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of removable parts</li>
<li>Materials unremarkable for the price</li>
</ul>
<p>The KBGV brewed my favorite coffee and in my opinion has the best look, like what you&#8217;d expect in the background of an FBI stakeout field HQ in a 70s movie. Where the OXO is rounded-off and unassuming, designed to disappear in a modern kitchen, the KBGV is bold and shiny.</p>
<p>The coffee it makes is bold, too: reliably strong and flavorful. Its #4 filter process to me was also pretty efficient with grounds.</p>
<p>The squat glass carafe sits on a hot plate that remains on for an hour or so after brewing, which is great but also means you must remember to turn it off — it won&#8217;t start a fire or anything, it&#8217;s just going to sit there being hot.</p>
<p>My main issue with the KBGV is that the reservoir and basket covers just sit on top rather than being on hinges, making the process of brewing involve removing and replacing several pieces. A small complaint, but they, like the carafe lid and basket, are also made of a rather ordinary plastic rather than something more durable. I feel like given the premium price you should be given something a bit more classy and convenient.</p>
<p>The good news is they&#8217;ll be easy to replace if they break, and Technivorm has an excellent warranty.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $330<a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/kbgv-select-polished-silver.html"> from Technivorm</a></p>
<h2><strong>For the &#8216;gram: Ratio 8</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely handsome</li>
<li>Excellent materials</li>
<li>Very simple operation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing to keep coffee warm</li>
<li>Quite large!</li>
<li>Very expensive</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectively the most good-looking of the machines here (even if I prefer the quirky charm of the KBGV), the Ratio 8, with its wood and textured metal finish, is obviously meant to be a display piece. And you couldn&#8217;t hide it if you wanted to — this thing is <em>big</em>, and the thick power cord juts straight out of the back, making it difficult to put anywhere but somewhere central.</p>
<p>The machine is basically an automatic Chemex brewer (Chemex makes one of their own that I tried to test but never heard back on), which kind of tells you everything you need to know. Chemex, with its wood-collared, single-piece carafes and luxuriously thick filters, is almost like the BMW of drip coffee, with all that implies. I like it, but I also acknowledge that it&#8217;s a bit over the top. And a machine that does it for you — well!</p>
<p>But as a Chemex brewer goes, it&#8217;s a lovely thing. You get that special extra clarity that the Chemex process brings, and there&#8217;s something wonderful about the way the coffee comes out of those carafes. Operating the machine is a single-button affair, which activates a short bloom period then showers the grounds over time with however much water you put in the reservoir.</p>
<p>I found that the Ratio 8 was best when making a full carafe, as with a half-portion I felt it over-watered and consequently under-extracted what I put in there. Unfortunately that full carafe will have to be consumed with a quickness, as the Ratio 8, despite its size and price, has nothing to keep the coffee warm once it&#8217;s been brewed.</p>
<p>For a showy and unique machine the Ratio 8 is great. But if all you want to do is make great drip, the OXO or KBGV is a much better use of your funds.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$495<a href="https://ratiocoffee.com/products/eight"> from Ratio</a></p>
<h1>More exotic methods</h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to make coffee, and while drip is the easiest and most reliable for most people, the following slightly more unusual options are also viable and perhaps more interesting as gifts.</p>

<h2><strong>ROK manual espresso maker</strong></h2>

<p>I avoided the many fancy espresso machines out there for this review mainly for the reason that they are complex, expensive and require considerable upkeep. The ROK is about as simple an espresso maker as you can get, bested only by a stovetop Moka pot.</p>
<p>To work the ROK, you pack your grounds into the included espresso filter and attach it to the machine like any other. Then you pour your hot water into the reservoir up top, raise the arms, and depress them with a slow, steady pressure that forces it through the filter. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>It may not be quite the high-pressure espresso you get from a &#8220;real&#8221; machine, but it&#8217;s quite good, and the process can be repeated to increase the volume and produce something like an americano. The coffee produced by the ROK is a bit like a Moka Pot&#8217;s, but a bit less strong and far less likely to be burnt.</p>
<p>The machine itself is bulletproof — and I mean I think it&#8217;s actually bulletproof. It&#8217;s practically solid metal, though the reservoir and bellows are rubber. Use this to make coffee while camping and then fend off a bear attack.</p>
<p>For a unique, electricity-free coffee experience the ROK is a great option, though not necessarily a practical one.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten to test this one yet (though I will), but designer Joey Roth hasn&#8217;t done me wrong yet. This new device from his workshop uses a completely new method of circulating hot water through grounds, making a drip-like cup in a very short time, or cold brew, or tea. If your loved one is a gadget fiend, this is one they probably haven&#8217;t had the chance to covet yet. Technically it uses pods, but they&#8217;re totally biodegradable and you can fill them with your own grounds or leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $185<a href="https://drinkosma.com"> from Osma</a></p>
<h1>Pourover cones</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve used pourover as my main method of making coffee for years, and it reliably produces the best single cup you can have, though at the cost of being somewhat time-consuming.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg 1246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Kalita Wave 185</h2>
<p>Kalita makes a couple sizes of these pourover cones, and although I have happily used my 155 for many years, if I could do it over again I&#8217;d opt for the slightly larger 185, which is more forgiving when you&#8217;re pouring and can brew more than the 16 ounces that is the realistic upper limit of mine.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $36 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1AM0Y/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000X1AM0Y&amp;linkId=32460a58cd4553793b909296495c7bf3">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>OXO&#8217;s pourover cone with tank</h2>
<p>If hovering by the stove and watering your grounds for the two to three minutes it takes to make a cup is not something you enjoy, <a href="https://www.oxo.com/categories/coffee-tea/brew/coffee-makers/pour-over-coffee-maker-with-water-tank.html#">OXO has a nice little gadget</a> that simplifies things. It&#8217;s basically a pourover cone with a reservoir that sits on top, dripping water through a few tiny holes at a steady rate.</p>
<p>It made a good cup and with minimal fuss, but the capacity is limited, so if you want more than 12 ounces you&#8217;ll have to refill the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$16 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ENK41Q6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01ENK41Q6&amp;linkId=2b186288107c19ad72ed22836a0554b8">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Kone and other metal filters</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://ablebrewing.com/products/kone-coffee-filter">permanent filters</a> have gotten quite good, and I have one that sits right on top of a cup. No more paper! However I would recommend these only to people who have a garbage disposal or sink that can handle a lot of grounds, because cleaning the filter involves losing a lot of grit down the drain. Occasional deep cleaning is required but it&#8217;s nice to reduce waste even a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Around $30-40, depending on brand.</p>
<h1>Coffee subscriptions</h1>
<p>Just as a general note: These types of subscriptions are great, but you need to do a little bit of research or your loved one will end up with a roast they don&#8217;t like. I don&#8217;t want to recommend any in particular, since they all specialize in different things, but aim to prop up independent roasteries and fair trade rather than just getting a steady supply of the same old thing from a major chain.</p>
<p><strong>Some good options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drinktrade.com/">Trade Coffee</a> &#8211; reliably recommended</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mistobox.com/">Mistobox</a> &#8211; wider selection</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the amount of time you&#8217;re spending at home these days, you deserve a better headset. A wireless one that works with your computer and maybe your console as well, with a mic for calls and great sound for games and movies. Fortunately there are a lot to choose from, and I&#8217;ve tested out your best options.</p>
<p>I asked the leading audio and peripheral companies to send over their flagship wireless headset, with prices ranging from about $100 to $250. Beyond this price range returns diminish swiftly, but right now that&#8217;s the sweet spot for comfort, sound and usability.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve avoided wireless headsets because there were too many compromises, but I&#8217;m pleased to say that the latency has been eliminated and battery life in the ones I reviewed is uniformly excellent. (NB: If the wireless version feels too expensive, you can often get wired ones for $50-100 less.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To test the headphones, I used them all for a variety of everyday tasks, from video calls to movies and music (with only minimal EQing to get a sense of their natural sound) to AAA games and indies. None require an app to work, though some have companion software for LEDs or game profiles. I have a fairly large head and medium-sized ears, for what it&#8217;s worth. All the headphones are rather bulky, though the angle I shot them at individually makes them look huge — you can see in the image up top that they&#8217;re all roughly the same size.</p>
<p>None of these headphones have active noise cancelling, but many offer decent physical isolation to the point where they offer a &#8220;monitor&#8221; feature that pipes in sound from the outside world — useful if you&#8217;re playing a game but waiting for the oven to preheat or something. Only the first set has a built-in mic, the rest have detachable ones of generally solid quality, certainly good enough for streaming and chatting, though for broadcast a separate one would be better. All these headphones use a USB-A style dongle, though the 7P/7X also has a USB-C connector.</p>
<h3>SteelSeries 7P/7X &#8211; $149</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076127" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076127" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076127 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1747" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076127" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The 7P and 7X headsets, designed with the PS5 and Xbox Series X in mind (as well as PC) respectively, are my first and most unreserved recommendation.</p>
<p>The standout feature on these is, to me, a truly surprising sound with an almost disturbingly broad stage and clarity. I almost couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing when I put on some familiar tracks I use for reference. This isn&#8217;t a 7.1 simulation or anything like that — but no doubt the gaming focus led to creating a large soundstage. It worked!</p>
<p>I also found the headphones to be very comfortable, with a &#8220;ski goggle&#8221; strap instead of a per-band adjustment that lets them sit very lightly as well as &#8220;remembering&#8221; your setting. The spacious earcups rotate for travel or comfort.</p>
<p>The built-in mic is unobtrusive and stows away nicely, but if you&#8217;re picky about placement it was a bit floppy to adjust. Many of the other headsets have nicer mics that completely detach — maybe that&#8217;s a plus for you, but I tend to lose them.</p>
<p>My main issues with these are that the controls feel cheap and not particularly well laid out. The bottom of the headset is a jumble of ports and buttons and the volume dials don&#8217;t have much travel — it&#8217;s 0 to 100 in one full swipe. (Volume control is independent from system volume.)</p>
<p>The dongle is different from the others in that it is itself USB-C, but with a USB-A cable attached. That&#8217;s good for compatibility, but the cable is three feet long, making it kind of silly to attach to some laptops and whatnot. You could easily get your own short cord, though.</p>
<p>At $150 I think these are an easy recommendation for just about anyone looking at that price range.</p>
<h3>Audio-Technica AT-GWL &#8211; $250</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076130" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076130" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076130 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1760" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=1536,1081 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=2048,1442 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076130" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The high price on these is partly because they are the wireless version of a headset that also comes wired, so if you want the solid audio performance and comfy fit, you can save some money by going wired.</p>
<p>The sound of the AT-GWLs is rich and naturally has a focus on the upper-mid vocal range, which makes voices in media really pop. I did find the sound a bit confined, which hitting the &#8220;surround&#8221; setting actually helped with. I know that this sort of virtualization has generally been frowned on, but it&#8217;s been a while since these settings have been over the top and distortive. I found surround better for games but not necessarily for music, but it&#8217;s very easy to switch on and off.</p>
<p>The headphones are light and adjusted with traditional, no-nonsense metal bands, with a single pad on the top. I would say they are the lightest-feeling pair I tested, with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/steelseries" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="steelseries">SteelSeries <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Razer coming in just behind owing to some extra weight and bulk. Despite being compact, the AT-GWLs felt airy but not big. The leather-microfiber combo cups are nice, and I think they&#8217;ll break in well to provide better isolation over time.</p>
<p>Where they fall short is in the interface. First, a note to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/audio-technica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="audio-technica">Audio-Technica: <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Turn down the notification noises! Turning the headset on, the mic on or off or hitting the system-independent volume max produces loud, surprising beeps. Too loud!</p>
<p>Second, the buttons and dials are stiff, small and same-feeling. Lifting a hand quickly to turn down the volume (maybe after a huge beep) you may very easily mistake the power switch for the volume dial. The dial also doubles as a button for surround mode, and next to it is a microscopic button to turn on and off the sound of surroundings. It&#8217;s a bit of a jumble — nothing you can&#8217;t get used to, but considering how nice other headsets on this list made their controls, it has to be said.</p>
<h3>HyperX Cloud II wireless &#8211; $100</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076131" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076131" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076131 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1739" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1068 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=2048,1425 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076131" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hyperx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hyperx">HyperX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (owned by Kingston) wasn&#8217;t exactly known for audio until fairly recently, but its previous Cloud headset got the crucial Wirecutter endorsement, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. For less money than any of the other headsets in this roundup, the follow-up to that headset (which I&#8217;m wearing right now) has excellent sound and isolation.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find a soundstage nearly as wide as the 7P/7X, but with more of a focus on the punchy lower register instead of on detail and placement. My music felt big and close, and the atmosphere of games likewise, more immediately present.</p>
<p>The Cloud II&#8217;s controls are simple and effective. The volume dial, tied directly to the system volume, is superb: grippy, with smooth motion and just the right amount of friction, and just-barely-there clicks. There are two good-size buttons, the power one concave and the mic mute (which gives different sounds for muted and active) convex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that they&#8217;re not as comfortable, for me anyway, as the others on this list. The cups (though a bit on the warm side) and band are perfectly fine. It&#8217;s that there&#8217;s little rotation to those cups, meaning there&#8217;s no play to accommodate the shape of your head. I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s just my big dome, but they were noticeably tighter at the front of my ear than the back, so I was constantly adjusting or trying to twist them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say this: If they add a bit more adjustment to the cups, these would be my default recommendation over the 7P/7X. As exciting as the SteelSeries sound is to me, the Cloud IIs seem more like what people expect, and are $50 cheaper.</p>
<h3>Logitech G-733 &#8211; $130</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076126" style="width: 2393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076126" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076126 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg" alt="" width="2383" height="1636" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg 2383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=1536,1055 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=2048,1406 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2383px) 100vw, 2383px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076126" class="wp-caption-text">The matte texture of the G733s had a weird interaction with my camera — they don&#8217;t look speckly IRL. Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>These are <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/logitech" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="logitech">Logitech&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> streamer-friendly, color-coordinated, LED-sporting set, but they&#8217;re better than the loud design would suggest.</p>
<p>The sound is definitely gaming-forward, with a definite emphasis on the low end and a very central, present sound that was a lot like the Cloud II.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was not expecting the G733s to be very comfortable — their stiff plastic look suggested they&#8217;d creak, weigh down my ears and crush my noggin. But in fact they&#8217;re really light and quite comfy! There&#8217;s a lot of play in the positions of the earcups. The fit is a little odd in that there&#8217;s a plainly inferior version of the 7P/7X&#8217;s &#8220;ski goggle&#8221; strap that really only has four settings, while the cups slide up and down about two thirds of an inch. It was <em>just</em> enough to accommodate my (again, apparently very large) head.</p>
<p>The mic boom is rather short, and sadly there is no indicator for when the mic is on or off, which is sometimes a minor inconvenience and sometimes a major pain. You can tell from the sound the mute button makes, though.</p>
<p>The volume dial is nice and smooth, though the &#8220;clicks&#8221; are really far apart. I like the texture of it and the mic mute button, the power button not so much. But it works.</p>
<p>The colors may not be to everyone&#8217;s liking, but I have to hand it to Logitech for going all the way. The headset, mic and even the USB dongle are all the same shade, making it much easier to keep track of them in my growing pile of headphones and widgets.</p>
<h3>Logitech Pro-X &#8211; $200</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076129" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076129" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076129 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1791" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=1536,1100 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=2048,1467 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076129" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Currently Logitech&#8217;s most premium set of gaming headphones, the Pro-X abandon the bright, plasticky look of its other sets and goes for understated and black.</p>
<p>The sound of the Logitech is big and very clear, with almost a reference feel in how balanced the bands are. I felt more presence in the mid-lows of smart bass-playing than the other sets. There is a &#8220;surround&#8221; feel that makes it feel more like you&#8217;re in a room of well-configured speakers than headphones, something that I think emerges from a de-emphasis of the center channel. The media is &#8220;out there,&#8221; not &#8220;in here.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad or a good thing, just distinct from the others.</p>
<p>The controls are about on par with the Cloud II&#8217;s: a nice frictiony volume wheel controlling system volume, a nice mic toggle button and a fairly meaty on-off switch you&#8217;re unlikely to trip on purpose.</p>
<p>Also like the Cloud IIs, there is no rotation to the earcups, making them less comfortable to me than the ATs and SteelSeries, and Logitech&#8217;s cheaper G-733s. A larger head than my own, if that&#8217;s possible, would definitely feel clamped. I do think these would wear in well, but all the same a bit of play would help a lot.</p>
<p>The external material, a satinized matte plastic, looks truly lovely but is an absolute fingerprint magnet. Considering you&#8217;ll be handling these a lot (and let&#8217;s be honest, not necessarily with freshly washed hands), you&#8217;re going to need to wipe them down rather more than any of the others I tested.</p>
<h3>Razer Blackshark V2 Pro &#8211; $180</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076125" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1826" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076125" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The understated Razer Blackshark V2 Pro soon became my go-to for PC gaming when the SteelSeries set was attached to the PS5.</p>
<p>Their sound is definitely gaming-focused, with extra oomph in the lows and mid-lows, but music didn&#8217;t sound overly shifted in that direction. The soundstage is full but not startlingly so, and everything sounded detailed without being harsh.</p>
<p>The Razers look heavy but aren&#8217;t — it varies day to day but I think they&#8217;re definitely competing for &#8220;most comfortable&#8221; with the A-Ts and SteelSeries. The cups feel spacious and have a nice seal, making for a very isolated listening experience. Adjustment is done with the wires attached to the cups, which is nothing special — I kind of wish this setup would let you adjust the cant as well as the height. The material is like the Logitechs — prone to fingerprints, though a little less so, in my experience.</p>
<p>Their controls are very well designed and laid out, all on one side. The protruding (system-independent) volume knob may seem odd at first but you&#8217;ll love it soon. The one big notch or click indicates exactly 50%, which is super useful for quick &#8220;calibration,&#8221; and turning the knob is smooth yet resistant enough that I never once accidentally changed it. Meanwhile there are conveniently placed and distinguishable buttons for mute and power, and ports for the detachable mic, charge cord and 3.5mm input.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hard pressed to think of any downsides to the Blackshark except that it doesn&#8217;t work with consoles.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ever since the pandemic hit the U.S. in full force last March, the B2B tech community keeps asking the same questions: Are businesses spending more on technology? What’s the money getting spent on? Is the sales cycle faster? What trends will likely carry into 2021?</p>
<p>Recently we decided to join forces to answer these questions. We analyzed data from the just-released Q4 2020 Outlook of the <a href="https://www.coupa.com/thecoupaBSI/">Coupa Business Spend Index (BSI)</a><u>,</u> a leading indicator of economic growth, in light of hundreds of conversations we have had with business-tech buyers this year.</p>

This perspective gives Coupa unique, real-time insights into tech spending trends across multiple industries.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Tech spending is continuing despite the economic recession &#8212; which helps explain why many startups are raising large rounds and even tapping public markets for capital.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, tech spending is continuing despite the economic recession &#8212; which helps explain why many tech startups are raising large financing rounds and even tapping the public markets for capital. Here are our three specific takeaways on current tech spending:</p>
<h2>Spending is shifting away from remote collaboration to SaaS and cloud computing</h2>
<p>Tech spending ranks among the hottest boardroom topics today. Decisions that used to be confined to the CIO’s organization are now operationally and strategically critical to the CEO. Multiple reasons drive this shift, but the pandemic has forced businesses to operate and engage with customers differently, almost overnight. Boards recognize that companies must change their business models and operations if they don’t want to become obsolete. The question on everyone’s mind is no longer “what are our technology investments?” but rather, “how fast can they happen?”</p>
<p>Spending on WFH/remote collaboration tools has largely run its course in the first wave of adaptation forced by the pandemic. Now we’re seeing a second wave of tech spending, in which enterprises adopt technology to make operations easier and simply keep their doors open.</p>
<p>SaaS solutions are replacing unsustainable manual processes. Consider Rhode Island’s decision to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-surveys-are-powering-rhode-island-gov-gina-raimondos-fight-against-coronavirus/">shift from in-person citizen surveying to using SurveyMonkey</a>. Many companies are shifting their vendor payments to digital payments, ditching paper checks entirely. Utility provider PG&amp;E is accelerating its digital transformation roadmap from five years to two years.</p>
<p>The second wave of adaptation has also pushed many companies to embrace the cloud, as this chart makes clear:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083157" style="width: 890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083157" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2083157" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png" alt="covid-19 has expanded cloud adoption chart" width="880" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png 880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083157" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battery Ventures <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, the difficulty of maintaining a traditional data center during a pandemic has pushed many companies to finally shift to cloud infrastructure under COVID. As they migrate that workload to the cloud, the pie is still expanding. Goldman Sachs and Battery Ventures data suggest $600 billion worth of disruption potential will bleed into 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition to SaaS and cloud adoption, companies across sectors are spending on technologies to reduce their reliance on humans. For instance, Tyson Foods<strong> </strong>is investing in and accelerating the adoption of automated technology to process poultry, pork and beef.</p>
<h2>All companies are digital product companies now</h2>
<p>Mention “digital product company” in the past, and we’d all think of Netflix. But now <em>every</em> company has to reimagine itself as offering digital products in a meaningful way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zephr.com">Zephr</a> has raised $8 million in a new funding round led by <a href="https://www.bdmifund.com">Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments</a> (owned by media giant Bertelsmann).</p>
<p>The London-headquarted startup&#8217;s customers already include publishers like McClatchy, News Corp Australia, Dennis Publishing and PEI Media. CEO James Henderson told me via email that rather than creating &#8220;a monolithic product that tries to do a bit of everything,&#8221; Zephr is &#8220;focused entirely on the experience and journey for the prospect or customer,&#8221; driving an average 150% increase in conversion rates and 25% increase in subscription revenue within the first six months.</p>
<p>Henderson added, &#8220;By offering the right product, package or message at the right time to the right person, Zephr improves conversion rates, drastically decreases churn and drives new, stable revenue.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To do this, Zephr largely relies on the publisher&#8217;s first-party data about its readers — Henderson said that this data is &#8220;by far the most important and powerful type of data that Zephr both uses and generates.&#8221; But it also takes advantage of contextual data, such as &#8220;time of day, to location, device or consumption patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that Zephr is a no-code tool, allowing non-technical members of the marketing, revenue and product teams to use a drag-and-drop editor to create different customer journeys.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083186" style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083186" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2083186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?w=477" alt="Zephr" width="477" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=105,150 105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=210,300 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=768,1096 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=477,680 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zephr</p></div></p>
<p>Asked how the pandemic has affected the startup&#8217;s business, Henderson said there were both &#8220;positive and negative indicators,&#8221; with newsrooms seeing record readership but in some cases also freezing spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;As firms prepare for a &#8216;post-pandemic&#8217; world, we are beginning to see our markets seize the opportunity of all these new potential subscribers and invest in subscription models &#8212; and in Zephr.&#8221; he said. &#8220;In publishing and news media, the old model of dominant advertising revenue is on the way out and we are well-placed to capitalize on that interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding also includes financing from Silicon Valley Bank UK Branch and brings Zephr&#8217;s total funding to $11 million. Previous investors include Knight Capital and Nauta Capital.</p>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s funding announcement, this money will go toward further product development (with a focus on increased personalization), as well as expansion across the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>“The recent weakness in the advertising market increased pressure for media companies to diversify revenue streams and aim to introduce or optimize subscription models,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bertelsmann-digital-media-investments" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bertelsmann-digital-media-investments">BDMI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Managing Director Urs Cete in a statement. &#8220;We recognise Zephr’s excellent technology that empowers publishers to galvanise the online subscription opportunity and create customer journeys that are truly unique.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared electric moped startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revel-d2f5" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revel-d2f5">Revel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said Friday that it will shut down its service in Austin later this month.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Frank Reig didn&#8217;t place the entire blame on the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused ridership to fall across shared micromobility services as well as public transit, for the company&#8217;s decision. Instead, Reig cited the combination of Austin&#8217;s &#8220;deep-rooted&#8221; car culture, which has only become further engrained during COVID. The service will shut down in Austin on December 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Revel came to Austin we knew there would be challenges,&#8221; Reig wrote in the statement that was posted on Twitter. &#8220;In addition to having a less dense urban core than our other markets, the city&#8217;s deep-rooted car culture was proven difficult to penetrate, especially during COVID.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A statement from our CEO &amp; Co-Founder: <a href="https://t.co/Cl5LSgGv5C">pic.twitter.com/Cl5LSgGv5C</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Revel (@_GoRevel) <a href="https://twitter.com/_GoRevel/status/1334879001555447808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One thing we’ve learned is that Austin, unlike markets that have more robust public transportation infrastructure, is a city that is still very car-dependent, and we have found our electric mopeds do not thrive in a “car culture” environment,&#8221; a company spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">COVID was an additional contributing factor. The lack of visitors to the city who could rely on Revel instead of renting and garaging a car, and overall reduction in movement among those who work and live in Austin, exacerbated the market challenges.</p>
<p>Revel, founded in March 2018 by Frank Reig and Paul Suhey, started with a pilot program in Brooklyn and later expanded to Queens, the Bronx and sections of Manhattan. It has been on a fast-paced growth track thanks to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/electric-moped-startup-revel-raises-27-6-million-as-it-eyes-new-markets/">$27.6 million in capital</a> raised October 2019 in a Series A round led by Ibex Investors. The equity round included newcomer Toyota AI Ventures and further investments from Blue Collective, Launch Capital and Maniv Mobility.</p>
<p>Revel <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">expanded to Austin, Miami and Washington, D.C in its first 18 months of operation. In January, the company launched in Oakland and received a permit in July to operate in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p>Revel has had a challenging year, and not just because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company voluntarily shut down operations in New York on July 28 after several of its users died in crashes. The company restarted its 3,000-strong fleet of mopeds in four boroughs after the city of New York approved its relaunch plan, which included several new features in its app aimed at increasing safety. Revel added training videos, tests and a helmet selfie feature that requires photographic evidence the user is wearing a helmet and a community reporting tool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Newport Beach, California-based healthcare lending service <a href="http://www.primahealthcredit.com/">PrimaHealth Credit</a> is now pitching point-of-sale lending services for elective medical procedures.</p>
<p>Taking the kinds of financial lending services that have been popularized by companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klarna" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="klarna">Klarna <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Affirm, PrimaHealth Credit is bringing them into elective surgical space for things like cataract surgery, orthodontic work, dental care or LASIK.</p>
<p>&#8220;For many dental, orthodontics, LASIK, and cataract surgery patients, our BNPL product is a ‘last resort’ &#8211; the difference between getting the treatment they need, or not,” said Brendon Kensel, founder and CEO of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/primahealth-credit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="primahealth-credit">PrimaHealth Credit, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company expects that patients will pay somewhere between 25% and 50% of the cost of their treatment up front with repayment durations for the loans ranging between two and four months.</p>
<p>Rates for the loans will range from 19.99% to 24.99% APR with average loan sizes coming in at around $1,800 across dental, orthodontics and LASIK, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Until now, when providers couldn’t approve patients for an existing payment plan, they’d either forego providing them care or take them on anyway, exposing themselves to significant liability as they struggle with adequately assessing creditworthiness and properly servicing and collecting loans,” Kensel said.</p>
<p>The program not only handles loan origination for healthcare practices, but handles the back-office tasks for payment and servicing.</p>
<p>“Our goal as a company is to remove barriers to patient acceptance and help people who have the means but not necessarily the credit score to get the quality care that everyone deserves,&#8221; Kensel said.</p>
<p>Using the PrimaHealth Credit mobile app, patients can receive instant credit decisions and choose the payment plan that works best for them. The company said the service is currently available in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas and will be expanded to all 50 states by 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> bought <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">this week for $27.7 billion</a>, it was in some ways the end of a startup fairytale. Slack was the living embodiment of the Silicon Valley startup success fantasy. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">started as a pivot</a> from a game company, of all things. It raised $1.4 billion, went from zero to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/slack-raising/">a $7 billion valuation</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/slack-reportedly-prices-ipo-at-26-per-share/">IPO</a>, checking off every box on the startup founder&#8217;s wish list.</p>
<p>Then quite suddenly this week, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was part of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plucked off the market for an enormous sum of money.</p>
<p>While we might not ever know the back (Slack) room maneuvering that went on to make the deal a reality, it is interesting to note that Slack CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/stewart-butterfield" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="stewart-butterfield">Stewart Butterfield <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview this week that he was not actually trying to sell the company when he approached Salesforce president and COO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earlier this year. Instead, he wanted to buy something from them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I actually talked to Bret in the early days of the pandemic to see if they wanted to sell us Quip because I thought it would be good for us, and I didn&#8217;t really know what their plans were [for it]. He said he&#8217;d get back to me, and then got back to me six months later or so,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<p>At that point, the conversation flipped and the companies began a series of discussions that eventually led to Salesforce acquiring Slack.</p>
<h2>Big money, big expectations</h2>
<p>From the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more. Taylor also said that having Slack gives Salesforce a missing communication layer on top of its other products, something especially important when interactions with customers, partners or fellow employees have become mostly digital.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we say we really want Slack to be this next generation interface for Customer 360, what we mean is we&#8217;re pulling together all these systems. How do you rally your teams around these systems in this digital work-anywhere world that we&#8217;re in right now where these teams are distributed and collaboration is more important than ever,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition/embed/#?secret=3kxr2l48Rp" data-secret="3kxr2l48Rp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Butterfield sees a natural connection between what people do in the course of their work, what machines do behind the scenes in these systems of record and engagement and how Slack can help bridge the gap between humans and machines.</p>
<p>He says that by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have hundreds of those kinds of actions a day, there&#8217;s a real opportunity to increase the velocity, and that has an impact, and not just in the minutes saved by the person doing the approval, but the speed of how the whole business operates,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<h2>Competing with Microsoft</h2>
<p>While neither executive said the deal was about competing with Microsoft, it was likely an underlying reason that the companies decided to join forces. They may prove better together than they are separately, and both have complicated histories with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Slack has had an ongoing battle with Microsoft and its Teams product for years. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/slack-has-filed-an-antitrust-complaint-against-microsoft-teams-in-the-eu/">filed suit against the company</a> last summer in the EU over what it called unfairly bundling of Teams for free with Office 365. In an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal, Butterfield said that he believes Microsoft sees his company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/stewart-butterfield-says-microsoft-sees-slack-as-existential-threat/">as an existential threat</a>. Hyperbole aside, there is tension and competition between the two enterprise software companies.</p>
<p>Salesforce and Microsoft also have a long history, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-microsoft/salesforce-sues-microsoft-as-legal-feud-escalates-idUSTRE65O4HT20100625">from lawsuits in the early days</a> to making friends and working together when it makes sense after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/after-5-years-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-has-transformed-more-than-the-stock-price/">Satya Nadella took over in 2014</a>, while still competing hard in the market. It&#8217;s hard not to see the deal in that context.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&#8217;s six biggest deals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals/embed/#?secret=dLhIzLh1wG" data-secret="dLhIzLh1wG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition/">a recent interview with TechCrunch</a>, Battery Ventures general partner Neeraj Agrawal said the deal was at least partially about catching Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products,&#8221; Agrawal told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As for Butterfield, while he saw the obvious competition, he denied the deal was about putting his company in a better position to compete with his rival.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that was really an important part of the rationale, at least for me,&#8221; he said, adding &#8220;the competition with Microsoft is overblown. The challenge for us was the narrative. They&#8217;re just good PR or something that I couldn&#8217;t figure out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Butterfield cited a list of large clients in enterprise tech, insurance and banking, the narrative has always been that Slack was favored by developer teams, which is where it initially gained traction. Whatever the reality, with Salesforce, Slack is definitely in a better position to compete with any and all comers in the enterprise communications space, and while it will be part of Salesforce, the two companies also have to figure out how to maintain some separation.</p>
<h2>Keeping Slack independent</h2>
<p>Taylor certainly recognizes that Slack&#8217;s current customers are watching closely to see how they handle the acquisition, and his company will have to walk a fine line between respecting the brand and product independence on one hand, while finding ways to create and build upon existing hooks into Salesforce to allow the CRM giant to take full advantage of its substantial investment.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy to do, but you can see a similar level of independence in some of Salesforce&#8217;s recent big-money purchases like MuleSoft, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">it bought in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>, and Tableau, the company it bought last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">for more than $15 billion</a>. As Butterfield points out, those two companies have clearly maintained their brand identity and independence, and he sees them as role models for Slack.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wKb3LCzZkN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/embed/#?secret=wKb3LCzZkN" data-secret="wKb3LCzZkN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s a layer of independence that&#8217;s like that [for Mulesoft and Tableau] because it&#8217;s not going to help anyone call us Chat Cloud or something like that. They paid a lot of money for us, so they want us to do more of what we were already doing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Taylor, whose opinion matters greatly here, certainly sees it in similar terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure we have a real integrated value proposition, a real integrated platform for developers, but also maintain Slack&#8217;s technology independence, technology agnostic platform and its brand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Better together</h2>
<p>As for the companies coming together, both men see a lot of potential here to merge Slack communications with Salesforce&#8217;s enterprise software prowess to make something better, and Taylor sees Slack helping link the two with workflows and automations.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think about automation, it&#8217;s event driven, these long-running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it&#8217;s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>The challenge these two men now face as they move forward with this acquisition, and all of the expectations inherent in a deal this large, is making it work. Salesforce has a lot of experience with large acquisitions, and they have handled some well, and some not so well. It&#8217;s going to be imperative for both companies that they get this right. It&#8217;s now up to Taylor and Butterfield to make sure that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is launching its own <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/online-payments">acquiring solution</a>. With this move, the company is competing directly with Stripe, Adyen, Braintree or Checkout.com. This is an in-house product and not just a fresh coat of paint on an existing solution.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already offers <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/">business accounts</a>. It lets you send and receive international payments, and exchange funds in multiple currencies. You also can order debit cards to spend money from your Revolut account directly.</p>
<p>With Revolut’s acquiring solution, the company is going one step further, as you can now accept card payments from your customers. Revolut supports 14 currencies and settles payments on your Revolut Business account the next day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When it comes to fees, you get a small allowance of free card payment processing fees <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/business-account-plans">depending on your plan</a>. Above that limit, you pay 1.3% on card transactions from customers based in Europe and the U.K. For other cards, you pay 2.8% on all transactions — there’s no free allowance.</p>
<p>This is slightly cheaper than Stripe, which costs 1.4% + £0.20 for European cards and 2.9% + £0.20 for non-European cards. Of course, companies like Stripe have been optimizing their payments infrastructure for many years. Right now, Stripe supports more payment methods, more currencies, advanced fraud prevention features, etc.</p>
<p>After you’ve created your merchant account, Revolut offers plugins for WooCommerce, Prestashop and Magento. You can also use the Merchant API to add a checkout widget on your custom website.</p>
<p>If you’re a freelancer and you just need to send a couple of invoices per month, you can also generate <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/payment-links">payment links</a>. The recipient can then pay from a web page hosted by Revolut.</p>
<p>The main advantage of Revolut’s acquiring solution is that it’s integrated with Revolut Business. You can see payments and banking in the same interface, you don’t need to alternate between your Stripe account and your bank account to reconcile transaction data.</p>

<p>It could work particularly well for B2B businesses that don’t handle a ton of transactions and don’t want to set up a separate payments solution. Let’s see what customers think of the API when they start using it.</p>
<p>Online payments are available for business customers in the U.K., Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The rest of the European Economic Area should get the feature soon.</p>

<p>The American food delivery unicorn now expects to debut at $90 to $95 per share, up from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/doordash-aims-to-add-11-billion-to-its-valuation-during-public-offering/">previous range of $75 to $85.</a> That&#8217;s a bump of 20% on the low end and 12% on the upper end of its IPO range.</p>

<hr />
<p>DoorDash still anticipates 317,656,521 shares outstanding after its IPO, giving the company a new, non-diluted valuation range between $28.6 billion and $30.2 billion. On a fully diluted basis, the company&#8217;s valuation rises to more than $35 billion.</p>
<p>For the on-demand giant, the upgrade is enormously positive news. Not only will its valuation stretch even further above its most recent private price &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">around $16 billion, set this summer</a> &#8212; but DoorDash will also raise even more money than it previously anticipated. That war chest will be welcome when a vaccine becomes widely available and food consumption habits could shift.</p>
<p>DoorDash will raise as much as $3.135 billion in its IPO, according to the filing.</p>
<p>After mulling over the company&#8217;s updated valuation from its new SEC filing, I&#8217;ve decided there are three things worth calling out and discussing. Let&#8217;s get into them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Friday, so to make our analysis as easy as possible I&#8217;ve broken it into discrete sections for your perusal. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>A path to profitability is important</h2>
<p>DoorDash&#8217;s most profitable quarters that we are aware of were its two most recent. During the June 30 quarter, the company saw positive net income of $23 million off revenues of $675 million. In the September 30 quarter, on the back of even more revenue growth, DoorDash lost a modest $42 million against $879 million in top line.</p>
<p>Those two quarters contrast with the first quarter of 2020 when DoorDash lost a far-greater $129 million against a far-smaller revenue result of $362 million, and Q4 2019 when the figures were a $134 million loss and revenues of just $298 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many companies will not see the uncertainty of a global pandemic as the perfect moment to go international, but for others (particularly in healthcare, online communications, and workplace mobility) the market is stronger than ever and companies are having to respond quickly internationally to both service existing clients and take advantage of the growth in demand.</p>
<p>We and our team at <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/en">Taylor Wessing</a> advise 50 to 75 venture-backed North American companies each year on setting up in Europe or Asia. We’ve helped companies such as TaskRabbit, Lime, Glossier, InVision and many others translate their domestic success to new jurisdictions and cultures and to thrive as global businesses.</p>
<p>This is a practical guide to international expansion with the challenges of the current time in mind. It&#8217;s a quick-read providing some practical tips and sharing best practices from peer companies to help you come out of the pandemic with a strong international presence. A great deal of this advice is evergreen and will serve you well whatever the circumstances may be.</p>
<p>In particular, we&#8217;ll cover the rise (and risks) of distributed workforces — a way for CEOs to hire the best talent anywhere in the world. This has taken on new significance with the boom in remote working as one of several options for CEOs looking for strategic growth during and after COVID.</p>
<h2>Is this the right time to expand overseas?</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, the timing question was much simpler. Founders would first of all focus on developing a product and winning over their domestic market, funded through their Series A and B rounds, and then go on to raise their Series C round, which investors would expect to be used to push into new markets.</p>
<p>Since then, with the age of the smartphone in full swing and international direct ordering ubiquitous, opportunities to sell into new markets appeared far earlier in a company&#8217;s growth and there is no longer a canned strategy for timing your international expansion.</p>
<p>The current circumstances have exaggerated this trend. There are many challenges in traditional sectors, but also many new market opportunities quickly appearing in healthcare and other technology sectors with founders wanting to move quickly into new markets.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to just get a few sales people on the ground to go for it, we would still recommend laying some groundwork and making some key decisions before diving in. For example: ensuring management can give sufficient time and attention to the new market; tweaking your product to comply with local regulations; reworking your sales approach.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			If you are early-stage, tread carefully. Our belief is that the Series B round is still the earliest a founder or board should consider international expansion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>If you are early-stage, tread carefully. Our belief is that the Series B round is still the earliest a founder or board should consider international expansion. The companies we&#8217;ve worked with who have moved earlier than the B round will generally end up realizing it&#8217;s too early. They&#8217;ll end up pressing pause, or making a full strategic exit, tail between legs.</p>
<p>International expansion is a matter of focus, as well as financial resources. Once you&#8217;re selling into a new market, everyone in the business needs to be thinking internationally, including the CEO, CFO, general counsel, the board, engineers and staff. It can stretch everyone before there are the necessary resources in place to cope.</p>
<h2>Decision made: How do you get going quickly?</h2>
<p>Even in the best of times our advice would be to not experiment or push the boundaries when it comes to your international strategy, do that elsewhere in your business. You should follow the path <em>most</em> travelled at this stage. This is especially true in the current climate. If you&#8217;re thinking of doing something new, something your peers haven&#8217;t done before, we should have a conversation first.</p>
<p>Whichever market you&#8217;ve chosen, there are some universal first steps (although they might vary slightly between jurisdictions). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a permanent establishment for tax purposes (i.e., the local tax authorities consider you established enough to be paying income tax and corporation tax), work on the basis that you&#8217;ll need to incorporate a company or register a local branch.</li>
<li>Consider flexible options when it comes to taking on people (more on this below). Remember that in all cases local employment contracts will be needed (subject to the use of PEOs – see below).</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, local agreements transferring IP ownership will be needed (see next chapter).</li>
<li>There will also be some local filings (e.g., tax, corporate, payroll) where you will need a local service provider such as an accountant and payroll provider.</li>
</ul>
