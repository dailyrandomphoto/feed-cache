										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Myanmar&#8217;s new military government has ordered local telecom firms to temporarily block Facebook in the Southeast Asian nation days after the military seized power in the country in a military coup.</p>
<p>Several users on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/myanmar/">Myanmar subreddit</a> reported moments ago that Facebook was already inaccessible for them, suggesting that internet service providers have already started to comply with the order, which demanded compliance by the midnight Wednesday.</p>
<p>Myanmar has alleged that Facebook is contributing to instability in the country and in order cited a section of the local telecom law that seeks to benefit public and state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, <a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1357078197989474305">reports</a> that MPT, a state-owned telecom operator that commands the market, has blocked Facebook as well as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp on its network.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">LATEST DEVELOPMENT : New military government orders telecom companies to temporarily block Facebook as they assume the social media platform is disturbing the restoration of stability in the country. Jumping back to 2000s in three days. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/myanmar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#myanmar</a> <a href="https://t.co/2BzUujCSfM">pic.twitter.com/2BzUujCSfM</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The move comes after days of unrest in Myanmar, where earlier this week military took control of the country and declared a state of emergency for a year after detaining civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders of her ruling National League for Democracy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Andreessen Horowitz founder Marc Andreessen announced that social media product veteran Sriram Krishnan will be joining the firm as their latest general partner.</p>
<p>Krishnan, whose previous roles include stints at Snap, Facebook and Twitter, has gained a higher profile in recent weeks from his recurring audio show &#8220;The Good Time Show&#8221; on Clubhouse. His recent talk with Tesla CEO Elon Musk was something of a watershed moment for the audio chat platform driving plenty of new attention to the budding app.</p>
<p>This announcement follows a report in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/37008f">The Information</a> regarding the hire earlier this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krishnan&#8217;s hire comes at an interesting point for Andreessen Horowitz, the firm is at the center of plenty of chatter among media circles regarding their &#8220;go direct&#8221; content strategy. At the same time, a16z and its leadership have played an increasingly hard-nosed role in driving a broader backlash against tech media in recent years among founders and tech enthusiasts in their orbit. Krishnan has spent much of the past couple years building out his flirtations with &#8220;tech optimism&#8221; content with his interview newsletter &#8220;The Observer Effect<em>,&#8221;</em> his Clubhouse show and his prolific Twitter usage.</p>
<p>Broader &#8220;tech pessimism&#8221; among media outlets has, I think, partially been owed to a swift and outspoken shift in thinking regarding the societal responsibilities of social media platforms to more aggressively moderate the content they are surfacing on a global scale. Some of the partners at a16z, a Facebook backer, have been among the more vocal in pushing back on these critiques even as the executives at their portfolio companies have seemed more amenable to shift their thinking.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/02/03/sriram-krishnan/">blog post</a>, Andreessen notes that Krishnan will be joining the firm&#8217;s consumer team to invest in areas that include social.</p>
<p>Krishnan, well-regarded in tech circles, may play an important role at the firm as they approach more social investments in a world where the effects of rapidly scaled consumer platforms have become more understood. The firm and its partners have been throwing their full support behind Clubhouse in an aggressive push to promote the platform, flexing the firm&#8217;s celebrity connections and influence along the way as the platform quickly picks up millions of new users. Krishnan&#8217;s direct operator roles engaging with the product struggles of building platforms that responsibly scale will likely be an asset as the firm faces increased competition across an increasingly frothy venture market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea of a virtual concert tour might seem tailor-made for the pandemic, but musician Todd Rundgren said he&#8217;s actually been thinking about something like this for years.</p>
<p>Rundgren told me that he&#8217;d become frustrated with our &#8220;collapsing&#8221; air travel system — exacerbated by hurricanes and climate change — that increasingly left him &#8220;sitting somewhere, unable to get to my next gig.&#8221; So he was already convinced that he needed to &#8220;start imagining other ways&#8221; to reach audiences.</p>
<p>But it was in the context of COVID-19 that Rundgren finally decided to make it happen, with his <a href="https://nocapshows.com/artist?name=toddrundgren">Clearly Human Tour</a> kicking off on February 14. He&#8217;d been planning for a traditional tour, but the dates kept getting pushed back due to the pandemic, until he finally told the organizers, &#8220;You have to let me do this. I can&#8217;t be committed to you and go two years without touring.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rundgren and his band will be performing entirely from Chicago, where they&#8217;ll play songs from across his career, as well as the entirety of his album &#8220;Nearly Human.&#8221; But the tour is taking place virtually across 25 U.S. cities, starting in Buffalo on February 14 and ending on March 22 in Seattle.</p>
<p>Rundgren said he found this more appealing than the idea of performing &#8220;one show and then blast it out to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INCrLl5Wzu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/">Spotify adds virtual event listings to its app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify adds virtual event listings to its app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/embed/#?secret=INCrLl5Wzu" data-secret="INCrLl5Wzu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;People plan weeks or months in advance for this particular event, it attracts people from all over the metropolitan area or a particular region,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a social event as much as anything else, and that&#8217;s what we are trying to do with the localization.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means performing live shows at 8 p.m., according to whatever the local time zone might be. Rundgren said the band will also try to &#8220;self-hypnotize&#8221; to get into the proper spirit: &#8220;We&#8217;ll dress all the walls with posters, sports team memorabilia &#8230; We&#8217;ll get food flown in from familiar local eateries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other features include virtual meet and greets with local fans, as well as placing video screens around the concert venue to display virtual audience members. (There are a limited number of in-person tickets for sale as well, but obviously those attendees will need to be in Chicago.)</p>
<p>The concerts will be geofenced, although Rundgren said the approach has evolved — it&#8217;s less about limiting the Buffalo concert to Buffalo attendees, and more about enforcing geographic restrictions based on Rundgren&#8217;s contractual obligations. Or as he put it, &#8220;It&#8217;s less about enclosing an audience, and more about fencing them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rundgren is staging the tour with support from <a href="https://nocapshows.com">NoCap</a>, the livestreaming concert startup <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9414054/cisco-adler-donavon-frankenreiter-launch-concert-livestream-platform-nocap">founded by musicians Cisco Adler and Donavon Frankenreiter</a>. NoCap has been around for less than a year, and Adler said that while it sold 700 tickets for its first show, it&#8217;s now selling &#8220;30, 40, 50 thousand tickets&#8221; per show. And he predicted that virtual concerts won&#8217;t be going away when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are all these underserved markets that you can visit once every five years, if that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The future of this becomes a hybrid model.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, he noted that televising sports has only made them &#8220;bigger and more global.&#8221; Similarly, when Adler was thinking about livestreaming concerts, he said, &#8220;I didn’t look at it as: How do we build a Band Aid and help everyone through this gap? It was more: How do we build a bridge to the other side of what music can be?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders — by now you must have heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> events on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1">April 1 and 2</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2">July 8 and 9</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Researchers are using AI to analyze MRI scans and even track elephants using satellite photography.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s more AI news out there than anyone can possibly keep up with. But you can stay tolerably up to date on the most interesting developments with this column, which collects AI and machine learning advancements from around the world and explains why they might be important to tech, startups or civilization.</p>
<p>Before we get to the research in this edition, however, here&#8217;s <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2021/01/25/who-winning-ai-race-china-eu-or-united-states-2021-update">a study from the ITIF</a> trade group evaluating the relative positions of the U.S., EU and China in the AI &#8220;race.&#8221; I put race in quotes because no one knows where we&#8217;re going or how long the track is — though it&#8217;s still worth checking who&#8217;s in front every once in a while.</p>
<p>The answer this year is the U.S., which is ahead largely due to private investment from large tech firms and venture capital. China is catching up in terms of money and published papers but still lags far behind and takes a hit for relying on U.S. silicon and infrastructure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LChcDZawvN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/">Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Pony.ai hits $5.3 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Pony.ai hits $5.3 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-pony-ai-hits-5-3-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=LChcDZawvN" data-secret="LChcDZawvN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The EU is operating at a smaller scale, and making smaller gains, especially in the area of AI-based startup funding. Part of that is no doubt the inflated valuations of U.S. companies, but the trend is clear — and perhaps an opportunity for investors is as well, who might see this as an opportunity to get in on some high-quality startups without needing quite so much capital.</p>

<p>On the farthest possible end from monetization and practical application, we have two interesting uses of machine learning in fields where human expertise is valued in different ways.</p>

<p>At Switzerland&#8217;s EPFL, some music-minded boffins at the Digital and Cognitive Musicology lab were investigating the shift in the use of modes in classical music over the ages — major, minor, other or none at all. In an effort to objectively categorize thousands of pieces from hundreds of years and composers, they created an unsupervised machine learning system to listen to and categorize the pieces according to mode. (Some of the data and methods are available <a href="https://github.com/DCMLab/HistoryModes_DataCode">on GitHub</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We already knew that in the Renaissance, for example, there were more than two modes. But for periods following the Classical era, the distinction between the modes blurs together. We wanted to see if we could nail down these differences more concretely,&#8221; <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/machine-learning-helps-retrace-evolution-of-clas-2/">he explained in a university news release</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chat platforms like Slack have been game-changers when it comes to what business users want and expect out of their work communications. Today, a company that&#8217;s aiming to move the goalpost again with an integrated, open-source alternative is announcing some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://rocket.chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket.Chat</a>, a startup and open-source-based platform of the same name used by banks, the U.S. Navy, NGOs and other organizations big and small to set up and run any variety of secure virtual communications services from one place &#8212; they can include not just team chat, but also customer service, collaboration platforms covering your staff and outside partners, school classrooms, conferences and more &#8212; has raised $19 million.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the funding both to continue adding more customers, but also expanding the platform&#8217;s functionality, including more security features, a way to use the service over federated blockchain architecture, apps for marketplaces, options for bots, and more social media and omnichannel customer service integrations, and potentially facilities for virtual events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As more business interactions have gone virtual, it has essentially opened the door for companies like Rocket.Chat building virtual communications platforms to build in an increasing number of features into what it does.</p>
<p>The Series A round of funding has four lead investors &#8212; <a href="https://valorcapitalgroup.com/">Valor Capital Group</a>, <a href="https://www.greycroft.com/">Greycroft</a>, <a href="https://monashees.com.br/pt-br/intro/">Monashees</a> and <a href="https://www.nea.com/">NEA</a> &#8212; with <a href="https://www.eventures.vc/">e.ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.graphenevc.com/">Graphene Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.onevc.vc/">ONEVC</a> and <a href="https://www.dgf.com.br/">DGF</a> also participating. The Porto Alegre, Brazil-based startup (which is incorporated in Delaware) has now raised $27 million to date.</p>
<p>Rocket.Chat is not disclosing its valuation with this round, but it comes on the back of some significant growth in the last year. The startup now has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">16 million registered users across 150 countries, with eight million of them monthly active users. Of that 16 million, 11.3 million users registered for the service in the past six months. It&#8217;s currently installed on some 845,000 servers, the company said, and has over 1,500 developers building on its platform.</span></p>
<p>Rocket.Chat&#8217;s funding and expanding business comes as part of a bigger focus overall for open-source platforms.</p>
<p>The promise of open source in the world of enterprise IT has been that it provides a platform to customise a service to fit with how the organization in question wants to use it, while at the same time providing tools to make sure it is robust enough in terms of security, extensibility and more for use in a business environment.</p>
<p>Over the years, it has become a big business opportunity, in line with organizations getting more sophisticated in terms of what they expect and need out of their IT services, where off-the-shelf apps may not always fit the bill.</p>
<p>Rocket.Chat positions itself as something of an all-in-one superstore for any and all communications needs, with organizations putting their own services together in whatever way works for their purposes.</p>
<p>It can either be hosted and managed by customers themselves, or used as a cloud-based SaaS, with its <a href="https://rocket.chat/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing</a> ranging between free (for minimal, self-hosted services) to $4 per user per month, or higher, depending on which services customers want to have, whether its hosted and how much the platform is being used each month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107947" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2107947 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png 3090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Product-Screenshot-Team-Collaboration.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rocket.Chat</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see in the mock-up here, its basic platform looks a little like Slack. But if you are using it for omnichannel communications for customer service, for example, you can build a platform within Rocket.Chat where you incorporate communications from any other platforms that might be used to communicate with customers.</p>
<p>Its work collaboration platform starts with Rocket.Chat&#8217;s basic chat interface, but also allows you to integrate alerts and links to other apps that you regularly use, as well as video calls and more. These and other functions built on Rocket.Chat can then be made to interact with each other &#8212; for example handing tickets off in customer service to internal tech support teams &#8212; or separately.</p>
<p>The idea is that by providing a version that can be hosted and managed by organizations themselves, it gives them more privacy and control over their electronic messaging.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its thousands of customers reflect an interesting mix of the kinds of organizations that are looking for solutions that do just that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gabriel Engel, the CEO and founder, tells me the list includes several military and public sector organizations including the U.S. Navy, financial services companies like <a href="https://rocket.chat/blog/events/google-summer-of-code-2020-together-credit-suisse-and-rocket-chat-empower-the-next-generation-of-open-source-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Credit Suisse</a> and Citibank, as well as the likes of Cornell, Arizona State, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">UC Irvine, Bielefeld University and other educational institutions, and a number of other private companies. </span></p>
<p>That flexibility does not always play to Rocket.Chat&#8217;s advantage, however. Controversially, it seems that the list also includes the other end of the spectrum of organizations that want to keep their messages limited to a very specific audience: <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/jihad-and-terrorism-threat-monitor-jttm-weekly-january-23-30-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamic State</a> it turns out also hosts and runs a Rocket.Chat to disseminate messages.</p>
<p>Engel says that while this is not something that the company supports, and that it works with authorities to shut down users like these as much as it can, it&#8217;s a consequence of how the service was built:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not able to track usage if they are running Rocket.Chat servers of their own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a reason why the U.S. Navy uses Rocket.Chat. And that&#8217;s because we cannot track and know what they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s isolated from any external influence, for better or worse.&#8221; He added that the company has policies so that if an illicit organization is using its SaaS version, these get taken down in cooperation with authorities. &#8220;But just as with Linux, if you download and run Rocket.Chat on your own computer, then obviously it&#8217;s out of our reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing about how a platform built with privacy by design can be abused, with seemingly little to be done about it, does seem to offset some of the benefits. The ethics of that predicament, and whether technology can ever solve it, or whether it will be up to government authorities to address, will continue to be a question not just for Rocket.Chat but for all of us.</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors are interested because of the alternative it provides to those groups that need it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“In today’s environment, organizations must have a secure communication platform to engage teams internally, communicate with customers and partners externally, and connect with safe interest-based communities,” said Dylan Pearce, partner at Greycroft, in a statement. “Rocket.Chat’s world-class management team and open-source community lead the industry in innovation and provide a communications platform capable of serving every person on the planet.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is so much data sitting inside companies these days, but getting data to the people who need it most remains a daunting challenge. <a href="https://www.polytomic.com/">Polytomic</a>, a graduate of the Y Combinator Winter 2020 cohort set out to solve that problem, and today the startup announced a $2.4 million seed.</p>
<p>Caffeinated Capital led the round with help from Bow Capital and a number of individual investors including the founders of PlanGrid, Tracy Young and Ralph Gootee, the company where Polytomic founders CEO Ghalib Suleiman and CTO Nathan Yergler both previously worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We synch internal data to business systems. You can imagine your sales team living in Salesforce and would like to see who&#8217;s using your product from your customer data that lives in other internal databases. We have a no-code web app that moves internal data to the business systems of the office,&#8221; Suleiman told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Data lives in silos across every company, and Polytomic lets you build the connectors by dragging and dropping components in the Polytomic interface. This new data then shows up as additional fields in the target application. So you might have a usage percentage field added to Salesforce automatically if you were connecting to customer usage data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RbLtbRxV8i"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stepzen-snares-8m-seed-to-build-data-integration-api/">StepZen snares $8M seed to build data integration API</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;StepZen snares $8M seed to build data integration API&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stepzen-snares-8m-seed-to-build-data-integration-api/embed/#?secret=RbLtbRxV8i" data-secret="RbLtbRxV8i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company actually sells the product to business operations teams, who would be charged with setting up a catalogue or menu of data sources that live in Polytomic. This is usually handled by someone like a business analyst who can configure the different sources. Once that&#8217;s done, anyone can build connectors to these data sources by selecting them from the menu and then choosing where to deliver the data.</p>
<p>The founders came up with the idea for the company because when they were at PlanGrid, they faced a problem getting data to the people who needed it in the company. The problem became more pronounced as the company grew and they had ever more data and more employees who needed access to it.</p>
<p>They left PlanGrid in 2018 and launched Polytomic a year later to begin attacking the problem. The two founders joined YC as a way to learn to refine the product, and were still working on it on Demo Day, delivering their presentation off the record because they weren&#8217;t quite done with it yet.</p>
<p>They released the first iteration of the product last September and report some progress getting customers and gaining revenue. Early customers include Brex, ShipBob, Sourcegraph and Vanta.</p>
<p>The company has no additional employees beyond the two founders as of yet, but with the seed funding in the bank, they plan to begin hiring a few people this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/INUgKm8uiqg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>No sooner did we start developing a newsletter, the newsletter industry exploded. Twitter jumped in with a purchase of Revue, Facebook was rumored to be investigating the platform, and each new day brought further experiments. You could blame it on the post-Trump lifting of the fog of despair. The pandemic continued apace, with new variants spurring distribution of vaccines and a transparency in communications with the new president and his team.</p>
<p>After years of social mining of our behavior, interests and transactions, inference has been replaced by direct evidence. The politics of data pressure mandate that we expect free software bundled with increasingly powerful hardware. The core utility of a phone culture shifted as people kept to their homes and mostly used the televisions for entertainment and news, and the phones as notifications consumers. The desktop remained the creation engine for business documents, analytics and information triage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One year after the pandemic took hold, the outlines of the recovery are becoming visible. Because so much of our transaction history is funneled through the phone, we have left less need or incentive for teasing out indirect data and making inferences on it. Netflix is a honeypot for direct recording of choices, tagged along each customer’s timeline with the minute-by-minute social characteristics of the groups they participate in.</p>
<p>The resulting data type is beyond the bifurcation of product in the Apple hardware sense and the user as product in the Google or Facebook sense, Netflix creates a kind of social signal out of the analytics that is recycled back into the service where it impacts on the user’s behavior organically. We tap into the recommendation flow not just at the Netflix level but also the notification and conversational flows.</p>
<p>Newsletters offer a similar organic resonance, as they combine the author’s analysis of the information flow (in the form of citations) with the actual orbiting references. As with Netflix, the user leaves a breadcrumb trail along with time data as they record their choices and unread items. The maturing newsletter model is one where the authorship more correctly anticipates what has been seen by the target audience, and saves time and insight for rapid return on the investment. Group metrics synthesize this benefit into value on Netflix, where the “ratings” are based on retention and time compression. This is the newsletter opportunity.</p>
<p>If you buy the idea of media consolidation under the newsletter umbrella, how will that manifest itself? Already we’re experiencing a battle similar to the age of blogs, where individual voices built a social engagement cloud that emulated the dynamics of a magazine. Just as Apple inserted itself into the music business with playlists and MTV with top 40 radio, blogs leveraged Twitter and social to create bundles of news, features and commentary. As with playlists, the users were in charge.</p>
<p>Mobile brought notifications to the party, blending blogs with media. Initially podcasts leveraged RSS’s attachment extension to download sound and video files to iPods. But when streaming arrived, the preferred way of consuming the content was by clicking on the notification. This in turn disrupted the cable networks just as the kids went mobile and abandoned TV. During the 2020 campaign, notifications were a great way of routing around insufferable analysis in favor of the actual events.<br />
Meanwhile, Facebook Live, Periscope and YouTube gave virtually everybody a seat at the table. Podcasts democratized media, and streaming democratized distribution. I know many think podcasting is experiencing a renaissance, but personally I think streaming is inventing a new paradigm of the economics of the industry.</p>
<p>Take Clubhouse, for example. It’s distinguished by what it doesn’t do rather than what it does: no recording, therefore no replays. No video, only audio. No lurking, at least surreptitious checking out the scene. If you click on a Clubhouse notification, your name pops up for all to see. And there’s no button to Leave Loudly, just Quietly. Significantly, however, you can operate in a private room, and then go public if you want to. It’s podcasting with an invisibility mode.</p>
<p>Private rooms are just the place to hash things out. Today I had several conversations skirting these issues. One was muted, tentative, doubt mixed with an arrogant optimism. The other was supple, teeming with validation and the presence of humor to leaven the serious nature of the fleeting time we may have. Not recorded, in one case just a regular cell call. But the mulch created informs this post, with its scaffolding of intersecting items lurking in calm support. Podcasting, no.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the Hayden Planetarium, where the planets orbit and the asteroids bisect the swirling cosmos. We’re suspended in the teeming reaches of the near universe, with its fractal efficiency in the representation of the whole.

					<description><![CDATA[We highlight some of Spotify Group Sessions user experience failings and offer ways to fix them, as well as a number of UX features that are done right. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In July last year, Spotify extended its shared-queue feature, Group Session, to support remote usage. Essentially a “party mode,” the feature offers a way for participants to contribute to a collaborative playlist in real-time and control what’s playing across everyone’s devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/spotifys-new-party-mode-feature-group-session-goes-remote/">As TechCrunch&#8217;s Sarah Perez explained</a>, Premium users are able to tune into the same playlist or podcast together at the same time, even if they’re not in the same place. Prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, Spotify, like a spew of other tech companies, is trying to create more shared online experiences that are lockdown-proof, and as people are being forced to spend more time indoors and online.</p>
<p>In our latest UX teardown, with the help of <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars</a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, we highlight some of Spotify Group Sessions user experience failings and offer ways to fix them, as well as a number of UX features that are done right. Many of these lessons can be applied to other existing digital products or ones you are currently building, including the need to remember the difference between usernames and display names, when it makes sense to combine common actions into one, and how to use &#8220;react and explain&#8221; on-boarding.</p>
<h2>Usernames and display names</h2>
<p>Always remember the difference between user names and displays.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106366" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106366" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?resize=768,324 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?resize=680,287 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CompareNames.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail<span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you created a Spotify account using Facebook, then you’re arbitrarily assigned an 11-digit display name. This is then shown to everyone you invite and is totally meaningless.</span></p>
<p>The fix<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Prompt the user to set a real display name when they create their first session. It avoids confusion and creates a more real experience.</span></p>
<p><strong>Steve O&#8217;Hear: This looks really sloppy and unprofessional, as well as being useless from a usability point of view. However, I’m guessing this is technical debt of some kind; any idea what’s going on here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter Ramsey:</strong> Yes, it happens when usernames go from being irrelevant (i.e., Spotify) to suddenly relevant (i.e. when they add social features). But by that point, the database/infrastructure is already in motion.</p>
<p><strong>Can you think of an example where this has been done right?</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is the perfect example of this done right. There can only be one @jack, but loads of people with the display name Jack. Otherwise basically every tweet would be by some obscure name and the world would feel like Reddit (i.e., anonymous).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has agreed to re-verify the age of every user in Italy and block access to users who state they are younger than 13, the country&#8217;s data protection agency <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9533424#english_version">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The video-sharing social network confirmed that from February 9 every user in Italy will be required to go through its age gate process again &#8212; and only those users aged 13 and older will be allowed to continue using the app.</p>
<p>Accounts of those who say they are younger than 13 will be deleted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move to require all users in Italy to go through TikTok&#8217;s age-verification process again follows an emergency <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224">order</a> by Italy&#8217;s GPDP on January 22 after the death of a 10-year-old girl from Palermo who died of asphyxiation after participating in a “blackout challenge” on the social network, according to reports in local media.</p>
<p>TikTok was given a deadline of January 29 to respond to the GPDP&#8217;s order, as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">reported earlier</a>. Today the agency confirmed the measures TikTok has agreed to take.</p>
<p>As well as asking all users in the country to re-enter their date of birth to continue using the app, the GPDP said TikTok will &#8220;consider deploying AI-based systems for age verification purposes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Italian watchdog added that it will be monitoring the effectiveness of TikTok&#8217;s age verification process.</p>
<p>The basic age-check TikTok conducts when users sign up &#8212; which it will be pushing out again to all users in Italy in a few days &#8212; simply requires users to enter a date of birth, so is very easy to circumvent. But it&#8217;s also clear that age verification online remains a hard problem.</p>
<p>Robust identity checks to determine age beyond doubt threaten a &#8220;sledgehammer to crack a nut&#8221; scenario &#8212; potentially limiting service access in a way that&#8217;s unfair and risking harm to online anonymity and privacy, with potential knock-on impacts on other considerations like freedom of expression and data security.</p>
<p>On the flip side are growing public concerns that underage users are being exposed to inappropriate and even harmful content online.</p>

<p>While TikTok&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the European Union is Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes a provision that allows national DPAs to take emergency interventions to protect users &#8212; which is the route the GPDP has used here.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to identify users below 13 years with reasonable certainty following this initial check, the company undertook to further consider the deployment of AI-based systems,&#8221; the agency said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the implementation of such systems requires balancing the need for accurate verification against the children’s right to data protection, the company committed to starting a dialogue with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) on the use of AI for age verification purposes. Ireland is where TikTok set its main establishment in the EU,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the Irish Data Protection Commission told TechCrunch: &#8220;The DPC is engaging with TikTok to review, in the context of the processing of personal data, the measures implemented by the company to ensure it has effective means of identifying child users on the platform and, more generally, the measures and protections to protect the most vulnerable of users in terms of risks arising from the processing of their personal data.&#8221; So it remains to be seen whether the regulator will push for more robust age checks.</p>
<p>In another change triggered by the GPDP&#8217;s intervention TikTok has implemented an in-app button to enable users to &#8220;quickly and easily&#8221; report other users that may seem to be below 13 years of age.</p>
<p>Per TikTok, these reports are reviewed by moderators and &#8220;removed as necessary&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the above measures supplement those already in place,&#8221; the GPDP said, adding: &#8220;TikTok undertook to also double the number of Italian moderators of platform contents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Alexandra Evans, TikTok&#8217;s head of child safety, added: &#8220;Keeping people on TikTok safe is our top priority. We&#8217;ve reached an agreement with the Garante and today, we&#8217;re taking additional steps to support our community in Italy. From February 9, we&#8217;ll be sending every user in Italy through our age gate process again and only users aged 13 and over will be able to continue using the app after going through this process. We&#8217;re also rolling out a new, dedicated in-app reporting button to allow users to flag an account they believe may be under the age of 13, which will then be reviewed by our team and removed as necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no finish line when it comes to protecting our users, especially our younger ones, and our work in this important area doesn&#8217;t stop. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re continuing to invest in the people, processes and technologies that help to keep our community a safe space for positive, creative expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s reissued age check in Italy will also be accompanied by a local information campaign in which TikTok will aim to raise parents’ and children’s awareness of the age checks and other child-safety-related features &#8212; both via its app and in the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;An information campaign will be launched by TikTok starting on February 4 both via the app and through other channels. The company will send push alerts to users on the app before blocking their access and will inform them on the need to enter their age. Banners will also be published containing links to information on security tools and on how to change profile settings from ‘public’ to ‘private’. The information campaign both via the web and through the press will be addressed to parents and the age threshold for registration will be specifically highlighted, among other things,&#8221; the GPDP said.</p>
<p>The agency also noted that TikTok has agreed to improve the wording of the short privacy notice intended for users aged under 18 years &#8212; &#8220;to explain what data are collected and how those data are processed in an easily understandable and user-oriented manner&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to TikTok&#8217;s impending information campaign, the GPDP is launching a child safety awareness-raising campaign of its own on national TV channels, in cooperation with a child protection charity called Telefono Azzurro. It said this will be targeted at parents to encourage them to supervise their kids&#8217; use of the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;The campaign is aimed at calling upon parents to actively supervise and pay special attention to the situations where their children are requested to enter their age in order to access TikTok,&#8221; it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition startup Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy laws when it collected photos of Canadians without their knowledge or permission, the country&#8217;s top privacy watchdog has ruled.</p>
<p>The New York-based company made its splashy newspaper debut a year ago by claiming it had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">collected over 3 billion photos</a> of people&#8217;s faces and touting its connections to law enforcement and police departments. But the startup has faced a slew of criticism for scraping social media sites also without their permission, prompting Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter to send cease and desist letters to demand it stops.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210203/?=february-2-2021">a statement</a>, Canada&#8217;s Office of the Privacy Commissioner said its investigation found Clearview had &#8220;collected highly sensitive biometric information without the knowledge or consent of individuals,&#8221; and that the startup &#8220;collected, used and disclosed Canadians&#8217; personal information for inappropriate purposes, which cannot be rendered appropriate via consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearview rebuffed the allegations, claiming Canada&#8217;s privacy laws do not apply because the company doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;real and substantial connection&#8221; to the country, and that consent was not required because the images it scraped were publicly available.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a challenge the company continues to face in court, as it faces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/">a class action suit</a> citing Illinois&#8217; biometric protection laws that last year dinged Facebook to the tune of $550 million for violating the same law.</p>
<p>The Canadian privacy watchdog rejected Clearview&#8217;s arguments, and said it would &#8220;pursue other actions&#8221; if the company does not follow its recommendations, which included stopping the collection on Canadians and deleting all previously collected images.</p>
<p>Clearview said in July that it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clearview-ai-canada/clearview-ai-stops-offering-facial-recognition-technology-in-canada-idUSKBN2472RA">stopped providing</a> its technology to Canadian customers after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Toronto Police Service were using the startup&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Clearview does is mass surveillance and it is illegal,&#8221; said Daniel Therrien, Canada&#8217;s privacy commissioner. &#8220;It is an affront to individuals&#8217; privacy rights and inflicts broad-based harm on all members of society, who find themselves continually in a police lineup. This is completely unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doug Mitchell, an attorney for Clearview, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Clearview AI&#8217;s technology is not available in Canada and it does not operate in Canada. In any event, Clearview AI only collects public information from the Internet which is explicitly permitted under PIPEDA. The Federal Court of Appeal has previously ruled in the privacy context that publicly available information means exactly what it says: &#8216;available or accessible by the citizenry at large.&#8217; There is no reason to apply a different standard here. Clearview AI is a search engine that collects public data just as much larger companies do, including Google, which is permitted to operate in Canada.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is developing a new feature that could give its app more of a TikTok-like feel: Vertical Instagram Stories. Today, users browse through Stories through taps and horizontal swipes &#8212; a feature Instagram adopted from Snapchat. But now, Stories are passé. Even Snapchat is borrowing ideas from TikTok. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">recent launch of Spotlight</a>, for example, is its own TikTok clone.</p>
<p>In many ways, vertical swiping feels more natural than taps and horizontal flicks. It is, after all, how users navigate much of the mobile web, as well as other key features across a variety of social apps, like Facebook&#8217;s News Feed or YouTube&#8217;s home page.</p>
<p>That said, turning Instagram Stories into a vertical feed would be a notable change, and one that could potentially set the stage for a shift away from more static content &#8212; like the photos and reshared Feed posts that still often fill the Stories section today. In a &#8220;Vertical Stories&#8221; feed, on the other hand, Instagram would likely prioritize video posts over images to better compete with TikTok, just as it&#8217;s currently tweaking its algorithms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">overall design</a> to prioritize Reels. (A turn of the dials that has already been leveraged by <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeJfAChp/">indie</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeJf5mxV/">creators</a> to <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeJfXGjT/">significantly</a> <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeJf5udh/">grow</a> their followings, in fact).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;Vertical Stories&#8221; feature was spotted under development by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1356574935024599040">Alessandro Paluzzi</a> who shared the discovery on his Twitter account.</p>

<p>&mdash; Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1356574935024599040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>His screenshot shows a simple user interface with text that reads: <em>&#8220;</em>Now you can swipe up and down to browse stories<em>&#8220;</em> and then a big, blue button labeled &#8220;Vertical Stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paluzzi tells TechCrunch that the feature is not yet live. Instead, he dug it up from Instagram&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>Instagram confirmed to TechCrunch the feature is being built but is not out to the public at this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an early prototype and is not currently testing on Instagram,&#8221; a company spokesperson told us.</p>
<p>A prototype may never actually make it to a public launch, of course, but its existence does say something about what sort of ideas Instagram is considering as a means of offering a better challenge to TikTok.</p>
<p>Today, the company&#8217;s TikTok rival, Reels, has been shoehorned into the platform via the Instagram Explore page, where Reels sits in the top position. When you click on the Reels video here, you&#8217;re taken to a new user interface where you then vertically swipe through videos, similar to TikTok.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t feel right, and the launch of the new format has added to Instagram&#8217;s clutter. Today, the app has all sorts of places users can publish their videos, including in the Feed, as Stories, as longer-form IGTV content, and now Reels. It&#8217;s too much.</p>
<p>Instagram knows this arrangement isn&#8217;t quite working. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast">recently told The Verge</a>, most people probably don&#8217;t even understand the difference between IGTV content and videos posted to Instagram, for example. He said the company was looking at ways to simplify and consolidate its ideas, too.</p>
<p>While his comments were focused on the confusion between Instagram&#8217;s normal video posts and IGTV, there&#8217;s also significant overlap between Instagram&#8217;s Stories&#8217; vertical video content and Reels. A &#8220;Vertical Stories&#8221; feed could allow for an eventual combination of those formats &#8212; Stories videos and Reels, perhaps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear that&#8217;s at all what Instagram has in mind, though. The social network could just be looking to transition another part of its app to the more modern vertical feed, as the demand for the traditional Stories format declines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google, together with its partner <a href="https://www.subcom.com/">SubCom</a>, today<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/googles-dunant-subsea-cable-is-now-ready-for-service"> announced</a> that the company&#8217;s privately owned Dunant subsea cable between Virginia Beach, Virginia and Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez on the French Atlantic coast is now operational.</p>
<p>Google first announced this project, which was named after the first Nobel Peace Prize winner and founder of the Red Cross, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant">Henry Dunant,</a> back in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/google-builds-its-own-subsea-cable-from-the-us-to-france/">middle of 2018</a>. At the time it expected the project to go live in 2020, but besides dealing with the complications of spanning a long cable between continents, the project leaders probably didn&#8217;t budget for a pandemic at the time.</p>
<p>The almost 4,000-mile cable has a total capacity of 250 terabits per second &#8212; or enough to transmit the &#8220;entire digitized Library of Congress three times every second&#8221; (though maybe using Library of Congress data size references is starting to <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2011/07/transferring-libraries-of-congress-of-data/">feel a bit antiquated at this point</a>?). Unlike some older cables, Dunant uses 12 fiber pairs, coupled with a number of <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/insights/submarine-sdm-cable">technical innovations around maximizing its bandwidth</a>, to achieve these numbers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U0L2UP4Rcq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/google-builds-its-own-subsea-cable-from-the-us-to-france/">Google builds its own subsea cable from the US to France</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google builds its own subsea cable from the US to France&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/google-builds-its-own-subsea-cable-from-the-us-to-france/embed/#?secret=U0L2UP4Rcq" data-secret="U0L2UP4Rcq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Google is dedicated to meeting the exploding demand for cloud services and online content that continues unabated,&#8221; said Mark Sokol, senior director of Infrastructure, Google Cloud. &#8220;With record-breaking capacity and transmission speeds, Dunant will help users access content wherever they may be and supplement one of the busiest routes on the internet to support the growth of Google Cloud. Dunant is a remarkable achievement that would not have been possible without the dedication of both SubCom and Google’s employees, partners, and suppliers, who overcame multiple challenges this year to make this system a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Dunant now being operational, the next Google cable to go live will be the Grace Hopper cable between New York and Europe, with landing sites in Bilbao, Spain and Bude, UK. Google first announced this new cable, which it is also building in partnership with SubCom, last July. It&#8217;s expected to go online in 2022 and will feature a total of 16 fiber pairs.</p>
<p>In addition, Google is also building the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/introducing-equiano-a-subsea-cable-from-portugal-to-south-africa">Equiano cable</a> from South Africa to Portugal. This cable is supposed to go online later this year.</p>
<p>In addition to its privately owned cables, Google is also a partner in a <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/en/insights/complete-list-of-google-s-subsea-cable-investments">number of consortiums</a> that band together to build cable systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several high-level Apple services are experiencing issues and outages on Wednesday morning, Apple has confirmed. These issues are impacting a number of consumer-facing services, including Apple Music and Radio, Apple Books, and the App Store platforms across both iOS devices and Mac.</p>
<p>For some users, the services are down. For example, there were reports circulating this morning that users were having problems <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-music-experiencing-outage">streaming music through Apple Music</a> or using iTunes. Other have noticed strange problems cropping up on the App Store &#8212; like app search results that only returned a small handful of top apps related to the search term.</p>
<p>Even when the services are partially up, they&#8217;re sometimes much slower to load than usual &#8212; meaning users may see blank pages for several seconds before the page is populated with its usual content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>At the time of the initial reports, <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">Apple&#8217;s Status page</a> didn&#8217;t reflect these issues, as it showed all services as being available. That has since changed. Now, the page displays outages are occurring across the App Store, Apple Book, Apple Music, Apple Music Radio, iTunes Store, Mac App Store and Radio.</p>
<p>The Apple Support Twitter account has also posted about the outage, but has yet to provide details about what has happened or when it might be resolved.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s concerning is that the account replied to a tweet with a complaint from a user who said they couldn&#8217;t reset their password &#8212; an indication that the outages could be impacting other types of backend services, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/los-angeles">Techstars Los Angeles</a>, the Los Angeles-focused branch of the global accelerator network, has named Matt Kozlov as its new managing director.</p>
<p>Kozlov, a longtime <a href="https://www.techstars.com">Techstars</a> network fixture, has previously served as the head of the organization&#8217;s healthcare accelerator through a partnership with Cedars-Sinai and as the head of the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator, which was focused on space and aerospace startups.</p>
<p>Now, Kozlov turns his attention to the Los Angeles ecosystem broadly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I’m humbled to have the opportunity each day to support incredible founders who are solving some of humanity’s greatest challenges,&#8221; said Kozlov, in a statement. &#8220;As I begin this new role, my goal is to continue to leverage my experience to help generate opportunities for future Techstars LA companies to make meaningful, long-term impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kozlov&#8217;s appointment comes as the Los Angeles tech ecosystem is having something of a moment. As the diaspora out of Silicon Valley continues, the Southern California tech world has proven to be a tempting landing pad during the COVID-19 pandemic. And remote work means that Los Angeles could be a fixture for more investors looking to escape the Bay.</p>
<p>Beyond Southern California&#8217;s coastal appeal is a vibrant technology ecosystem that encompasses enterprise software, financial services, healthcare, aerospace and defense, robotics, e-commerce and social media. It&#8217;s the home of social networking favorites Snap and TikTok&#8217;s U.S. base of operations, and SpaceX&#8217;s significant presence has given rise to a number of talented hardware and engineering startups.</p>
<p>LA is truly having a moment, and Kozlov&#8217;s experience with some of the less-well-known corners of the city&#8217;s tech ecosystem could be a boon for the Techstars program.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled by the selection of Matt as the new Managing Director for Techstars LA,” said Anna Barber, former managing director, Techstars LA, who stepped down from the role in November to join venture firm M13 as partner, in a statement. “He is a talented investor and longstanding leader in LA’s Techstars community, and has been an essential and valued mentor for the program for the past four years. He embodies the Techstars values of #givefirst and I have every confidence that he is the right leader to continue building on what we’ve established in the LA community.”</p>
<p>Collectively, the 40 alumni companies that have participated in Techstars Los Angeles accelerator program have raised more than $126 million and have a combined market cap of $328.6 million.</p>
<p>“Techstars LA plays a critical role in the Los Angeles tech ecosystem as the premier startup accelerator, providing valuable mentorship and funding for dozens of companies a year,” said Spencer Rascoff, chair of dot.LA and a Los Angeles angel investor. “I’m very excited that Matt will be the new Managing Director of Techstars LA. He brings extensive experience in healthcare and aerospace investing and has been an incredible mentor and leader to the companies of the Techstars Starburst Space Accelerator over the last several years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Revel, the shared electric moped startup, is building a DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles in New York City, the first in a new business venture that will eventually spread to other cities.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday that this new &#8220;Superhub,&#8221; which is located at the former Pfizer building in Brooklyn, will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. This will be the first in a network of Superhubs opened by Revel across New York City, the company said.</p>
<p>Revel didn&#8217;t build the EV charging infrastructure in-house. Instead, it is using Tritium&#8217;s new RTM75 model for the first 10 chargers at its Brooklyn site, which will go live this spring. These chargers are designed to deliver 100 additional miles of charge to an electric vehicle in about 20 minutes, according to Revel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EV charging business has been couched by Revel as a mission to electrify cities. The move comes as a growing number of automakers, including legacy companies like GM, Ford and VW Group, along with new entrant Rivian and EV leader Tesla, add more electric vehicles to their portfolios.</p>
<p>Revel&#8217;s expansion into charging marks its first new product line since launching a shared fleet of electric mopeds in 2018. Revel, founded by Frank Reig and Paul Suhey, started with a pilot program in Brooklyn and later expanded to Queens, the Bronx and sections of Manhattan. It has been on a fast-paced growth track thanks to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/electric-moped-startup-revel-raises-27-6-million-as-it-eyes-new-markets/">$27.6 million in capital</a> raised in October 2019 in a Series A round led by Ibex Investors. The equity round included newcomer Toyota AI Ventures and further investments from Blue Collective, Launch Capital and Maniv Mobility.</p>
<p>Several thousand mopeds are available to rent in New York City today. Revel expanded its shared moped business to other cities such as Austin, Miami and Washington, D.C in its first 18 months of operation. Last year, the company launched in Oakland and received a permit in July 2020 to operate in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Shared mopeds haven&#8217;t been successful everywhere. Revel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/revel-pulls-electric-mopeds-after-failing-to-make-a-dent-in-austins-car-culture/">pulled out of Austin</a> in December. Reig said at the time that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused ridership to fall across shared micromobility services, along with the city&#8217;s deep-rooted car culture, was proven difficult to penetrate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market has skewed later and larger in recent quarters, something you might have felt in the rapid recent pace of new unicorn formation. December was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/">hot month</a> for new unicorns, for example. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">was January</a>. February likely will be more of the same.</p>
<p>Powering those unicorn births are huge rounds led by large funds. In 2020, for example, there were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/whats-going-on-with-fintech-venture-capital-investment/">at least 97 global fintech rounds worth $100 million</a> or more. That number was up from 92 in 2019 and 66 in 2018. Each preceding year was a prior record.</p>

<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s possible to see how venture is trending toward bigger, later-stage rounds in other pieces of private market data. Venture capital in Europe during Q4 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">set a record for dollars invested</a>, some $14.3 billion, for example. But that money was spread against the continent&#8217;s lowest deal count since Q4 2019.</p>

A median Series B on the continent saw its value double from $10 million in 2016 to $20 million in 2020, for example.</p>
<p>Adding to the pile of numbers, the U.S. startup industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">raised around 90 rounds worth $100 million or more in Q3 2020 alone</a>.</p>
<p>The data goes on and on. If you read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/fintech-startups-and-unicorns-had-a-stellar-q4-2020/">essentially any recent TechCrunch piece</a> concerning the state of venture capital, private rounds are getting bigger as unicorns propagate, and the pace at which the market manages to find exits for the largest startups lags their aggregate value creation.</p>
<p>2021 could be more than just more of the same; this year could set fresh records for private investment results.</p>
<p>Parsing data from Silicon Valley Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/state-of-the-markets-2021-q1-report">most recent markets&#8217; report</a>, I&#8217;ve pulled a few trends that help illustrate where the startup and private capital markets are heading this year. And, for flavor, I&#8217;ve also collected some data from <a href="https://www2.insightpartners.com/scale-up-report">an Insight Partners&#8217; dive</a> into the impact that middle-aged startups have on job creation. That final set of data will illustrate how quickly the startup market has bounced back from COVID-19 lows to near-record numbers and what that rebound could mean for 2021.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be one hell of a year. Let&#8217;s talk about why.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like countless other industries, mobile phone sales got hit hard in 2020. The industry hit a 10.5% decline for the year, as COVID-19 first decimated the supply and later consumer demand for devices. It was the latest in a rough couple of years for manufacturers, but 2020 hit significantly harder than most.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-03-gartner-says-worldwide-smartphone-sales-to-grow-11-percent-in-2021">New numbers from Gartner</a> point to a rebound to pre-2020 levels. The firm is forecasting 1.5 billion devices shipped globally for 2021, amounting to an 11.4% increase across the board. We certainly saw the beginnings of that rebound arrive in Q4 for last year, as declines continued to slow, thanks in no small part to a record quarter for iPhone sales.</p>
<p>That points to the beginnings of a so-called “supercycle” for Apple, which hits a sort of perfect storm. The last few years have seen consumers slow down upgrades, as device prices increased, features were generally less compelling and their existing devices were perfectly fine so as not to warrant a standard two to three year upgrade pattern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Analysts pointed to 5G as a clear conduit for righting slipping sales numbers early last year, but a global pandemic very much threw a wrench in all of that. If anything, however, the iPhone’s COVID-19-related delay actually contributed to a stellar quarter for the company, both in time for holiday sales and the arrival of multiple vaccines that pointed to some potential return to normalcy.</p>
<p>The long-awaited 5G bump will continue in 2021, according to the new numbers, coupled with a quick push to offer next-gen wireless at an accessible price.</p>
<p>“The growing availability of 5G networks coupled with a higher variety of 5G smartphones starting at $200 will steer demand in mature markets and China,” the firm notes. “Demand in emerging countries will be driven by buyers looking for a smartphone with better specifications and a 5G connectivity as an optional feature. Gartner forecasts sales of 5G smartphones will total 539 million units worldwide in 2021, which will represent 35% of total smartphone sales in that year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced this morning that it has agreed to acquire e-signature startup <a href="http://signrequest.com">SignRequest</a> for $55 million. The acquisition gives the company a native signature component it has been lacking and opens up new workflows for the company.</p>
<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie says the company has seen increased demand from customers to digitize more of their workflows, and this acquisition is about giving them a signature component right inside Box that will be known as Box Sign moving forward. &#8220;With Box Sign, customers can have a seamless e-signature experience right where their content already lives,&#8221; Levie told me.</p>
<p>While Box has partnerships with other e-signature vendors, this gives it one to call its own, one that will be built into Box starting this summer. As we have learned during this pandemic, the more work we can do remotely, the safer it is. Even after the pandemic ends and we get back to more face-to-face interactions, being able to do things fully in the cloud and removing paper from the workflow will speed up everything.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The massive push to remote work effectively instantly highlighted for every enterprise where their digital workflows were breaking down. And e-signature was a major part of that — too many industries still rely on paper-based processes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hPUhxrNXZs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/aaron-levie-we-have-way-too-many-manual-processes-in-businesses/">Aaron Levie: &#8216;We have way too many manual processes in businesses&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aaron Levie: &#8216;We have way too many manual processes in businesses&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/aaron-levie-we-have-way-too-many-manual-processes-in-businesses/embed/#?secret=hPUhxrNXZs" data-secret="hPUhxrNXZs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Levie says that the signature component has been a key missing piece from the platform. &#8220;As for our platform, when you look at Snowflake, they’re the data cloud. Salesforce is the sales cloud. Adobe is the marketing cloud. We want to build the content cloud. Imagine one platform that can power the entire lifecycle of content. E-signature has been a major missing link for critical workflows,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He believes this will open up the platform for a number of scenarios, that while possible before, could not flow as easily between Box components. &#8220;Having SignRequest gets us more natively into mission-critical workflows like customer contracts, vendor onboarding, healthcare onboarding and supply chain collaboration,&#8221; Levie explained.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/">Dropbox acquired HelloSign for $230 million</a> two years ago to provide it with a similar kind of functionality and workflow capability, but analyst Alan Pelz-Sharpe from Deep Analysis, a firm that follows the content management market, says this wasn&#8217;t really in reaction to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what is interesting here is that Box is going to integrate SignRequest and bundle it as part of the standard service. That’s what really caught my eye as the challenge with e-sig is that it&#8217;s typically a separate product and so gets limited use. They bought it partly in response to Dropbox, but it was a hole that needed fixing regardless so would have done so anyway,&#8221; Pelz-Sharpe explained.</p>
<p>As for SignRequest, the company was founded in the Netherlands in 2014. Neither PitchBook nor Crunchbase has a record of it raising funds. The plan is for the company&#8217;s employees to join Box and help build the signature component that will become Box Sign. According to a<a href="https://signrequest.com/en/signrequest-is-joining-box"> message to customers on the company website</a>, existing customers will have the opportunity over the next year to move to Box Sign, and get all of the other components of the Box platform.</p>
<p>Levie says the basic Box Sign function will be built into the platform at no additional charge, but there will be more advanced features coming that they could charge for. The deal is expected to close soon with the SignRequest team remaining in The Netherlands.</p>

<p>The new and improved Extra Crunch Live pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radutt">Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt</a> and <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/gaurav-gupta/">LVP&#8217;s Gaurav Gupta</a>) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven&#8217;t yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30 a.m. PST/2:30 p.m. EST to 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s learn a little bit more about Gupta and Dutt.</p>
<p>Before becoming an investor, Gupta enjoyed a rich career in the product development sphere, holding positions at Elastic (where he led product management), Splunk (VP of Products), as well as Google, Gateway and the McKenna Group. He joined Lightspeed in 2019 as a partner, focusing primarily on enterprise software. He&#8217;s led investments in Impira, Blameless, Hasura and Panther, and of course, Grafana. He sits on the board of the last three companies in that list.</p>
<p>Dutt is the co-founder and CEO at Grafana Labs, but the fast-growing company isn&#8217;t his first go at entrepreneurialism. Dutt also founded and led Voxel, a cloud-hosting startup that was acquired by Internap for $30 million in 2012.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Gupta and Dutt join us on our first episode of Extra Crunch Live in 2021. As a reminder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=lightspeedgrafana">Extra Crunch Live is for Extra Crunch members only</a>. We&#8217;re coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on-demand if you can&#8217;t join us live. It&#8217;s worth the cost of the subscription on its own, but EC members also get access to our premium content, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ec-market-map/">market maps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ec-investor-survey/">investor surveys</a>.
