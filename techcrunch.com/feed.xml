</div><p id="speakable-summary">After a record year for biotech investment in 2020 — during which the <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-biotech-went-to-work-as-the-world-stayed-home">industry saw</a> $28.5 billion invested across 1,073 deals — the market for new innovations remains strong. What&#8217;s more, these innovations are increasingly coming to market by way of early-stage startups and/or their scientific founders from academia.</p>
<p>In 2018, for instance, U.S. campuses conducted $79 billion worth of sponsored research, much of it thanks to the federal government. That number <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/pandemic-pounds-us-universities-federal-support-helps-their-labs-stay-afloat">spiked</a> amid the pandemic and could increase even more if President Biden’s infrastructure plan, which <a href="https://www.bioprocessonline.com/doc/outlook-biotech-in-beyond-0001">includes</a> $180 billion to enhance R&amp;D efforts, passes.</p>
<p><a href="https://autm.net/AUTM/media/Surveys-Tools/Documents/AUTM-2019-Infographic-FNL.pdf">Since 1996</a>, 14,000 startups have licensed technology out of those universities, and 67% of licenses were taken by startups or small companies. Meanwhile, the median step-up from seed to Series A is now 2x — higher than all other stages, suggesting that biotech startups are continuing to attract investment at earlier stages.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to protecting IP, early and consistent communication with investors, tech transfer offices and advisers can make all the difference.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For biotech startups and their founders, these headwinds signal immense promise. But initial funding is only one part of a long journey that (ideally) ends with bringing a product to market. Along the way, founders will need to procure additional investments, develop strategic partnerships and stave off competition. All of which starts by protecting the fundamental asset of any biotech company: its intellectual property.</p>
<p>Here are three key considerations for startups and founders as they get started.</p>
<h2>Start with an option agreement</h2>
<p>Most early-stage biotechnology starts in a university lab. Then, a disclosure is made with the university’s tech transfer office and a patent is filed with the hopes that the product can be taken out into the market (by, for instance, a new startup). More often than not, the vehicle to do this is a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>A licensing agreement is important because it shows investors the company has exclusive access to the technology in question. This in turn allows them to attract the investments required to truly grow the company: hire a team, build strategic partnerships and conduct additional studies.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean jumping right to a full-blown licensing agreement is the best way to start. An option agreement is often the better move.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Don't wait until it's too late to build your early-stage marketing team — but don't hire too hastily, either.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ants and camels are famously resilient, but when it was time to select a name for a startup that offers open-source, cloud-based distributed database architecture, you can imagine why &#8220;Cockroach Labs&#8221; was the final candidate.</p>
<p>Database technology is fundamental infrastructure, which partially explains why it&#8217;s so resistant to innovation: Oracle Database was released in 1979, and MySQL didn&#8217;t reach the market until 1995.</p>
<p>Since hitting the market six years ago, CockroachDB has become &#8220;a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Bob Reselman, who interviewed the company&#8217;s founders to write a four-part series:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Part 1: Origin story</a>: From the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google’s most well-known infrastructure products.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">Part 2: Technical design</a>: Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">Part 3: Developer relations and business</a>: How CockroachDB engages with developers while pivoting to the cloud at a key inflection point.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-future/">Part 4: Competitive landscape and future</a>: A look at the fierce competition, and what possible exit routes might look like.</p>

<p>Our ongoing search for the best startup growth marketers is yielding results: reporter Anna Heim <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/this-early-stage-marketing-expert-says-b2b-saas-is-actually-very-very-cool-n">interviewed SaaS and early-stage startup marketing consultant Lucy Heskins</a> to learn more about the mistakes her clients are most likely to make before they seek her help.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is hiring a marketer too soon,&#8221; said Heskins. &#8220;I’ve come into startups thinking I was coming in to set up their in-house function. However, very quickly you realize that they’ve jumped the gun and think they’ve got product-market fit when they are nowhere near it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heskins shared a few pages from her early-stage marketing playbook, in which she recommends aligning content marketing with the customer experience — as opposed to just putting pages up that score well in search results.</p>
<p>Because their conversation contains a lot of strategic advice for startups that haven&#8217;t yet made a marketing hire, we made it available on TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If you know of a skilled growth marketer, please share your recommendation <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">in this quick survey</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading!</p>

<p>Congratulations: You&#8217;ve joined a startup and received an Incentive stock option grant! You now own a percentage of the company, and there&#8217;s no telling how much it could be worth one day.</p>
<p>A few questions: Do you know your 409A valuation? What&#8217;s your strike price? Surely, you know the preferred share price and which type of options you were granted?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s complicated stuff, and for most ISO recipients, this may be the first time they start thinking seriously about how federal tax laws impact them personally.</p>
<p>To break things down, Vieje Piauwasdy, Secfi&#8217;s director of equity strategy, recently shared a post with Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’ve ever been confused about your equity, or haven’t thought much about it, you’re not alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>First of all, what is suptech?</p>
<p>“The emergence of purpose-built technologies to facilitate regulator oversight has, over the past few years, garnered its own moniker of supervisory technology, or suptech,” Marc Gilman, the general counsel and VP of compliance at Theta Lake, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Gilman notes that “nearly every financial services regulator is engaged in some type of suptech activity.”</p>
<p>But as a primer, he focused on three areas: regulatory reporting, machine-readable regulation, and market and conduct oversight.</p>

<p>Superhuman co-founder and CEO Rahul Vohra joined us last week at TechCrunch Early Stage to provide an in-depth look at how he and his company worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of “growth hacking” that would not only help Superhuman attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too.</p>
<p>Vohra articulated a system that other entrepreneurs should be able to apply to their own businesses, regardless of area or focus.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a postdoc engineer who started STEM OPT in June after failing to get selected in the H-1B lottery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A colleague suggested that I apply for an EB-1A for extraordinary ability green card, but I have not won any major awards, much less a Nobel Prize. Would you tell me more about the EB-1A?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim dialed in on India for today&#8217;s Exchange, noting that the country is a good example of the global trend of booming venture capital dollars invested.</p>
<p>&#8220;The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is on pace for a record year,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at recent venture capital results and considered what Zomato&#8217;s flotation means for the country&#8217;s IPO pipeline. Don&#8217;t miss this analysis of an explosive startup market.</p>

<p>Now that COVID-19 vaccines are encouraging the world to reopen, two trends are underway:</p>
<p>In the first half of 2021, mergers and acquisitions increased by more than 150% YOY to $2.4 trillion; in several surveys, an overwhelming majority of workers said they intend to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>If your startup is angling toward an exit, the promise of a big payday may not be enough to retain employees who feel burned out or dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Many founders don&#8217;t have prior management experience, and, frankly, the uncertainty associated with an exit makes it a poor time for on-the-job learning. With that in mind, here are several communication strategies that can help you keep your winning team intact.</p>

<p>How do you go beyond the names and numbers with your startup pitch deck? For Doug Landis, the answer is one simple compound gerund: storytelling. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot of late in Silicon Valley, but it’s one that could legitimately help your startup stand out from the pack amid the pile of pitches.</p>
<p>Landis joined the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to offer a presentation about the value of storytelling for startups, whittling down the standard two-hour conversation to a 30-minute version.</p>
<p>Though he still managed to rewind things pretty far, opening with, “400,000 years ago, men and women used to sit around the fire pit and tell stories about their day, about their hunt, about the one that got away.”</p>

<p>We kicked off our TechCrunch Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising event with a deep dive on all the tips and tricks required to get the most out of pitching and slide decks. On hand was Adina Tecklu, a principal at Khosla Ventures, and who formerly built out Canaan Beta, the consumer seed practice at Canaan Partners.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of knowing your customer (aka your potential investor), focusing on story, typical slides in a deck, the appendix slides, formatting, and then alternative formats and which to avoid in a pitch deck.</p>

<p>News that Apple plans to get into the buy now, pay later game had Alex Wilhelm wondering about the impact on startups in the space.</p>
<p>Shares of public competitors Affirm and Afterpay dropped on the news, but it doesn’t mean a death knell for those looking to jump into the BNPL game, Alex notes.</p>
<p>“Provided that Apple’s BNPL solution is rolled out over time to the same markets where Apple Pay is present, the … company could consume market shares — and therefore oxygen — from generalized rival BNPL services,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Those startups building more niche or targeted solutions will likely enjoy some shelter from the competitive storms.”</p>

<p>So how does the math work out for all these startups with minimal revenue, tons of cash and sky-high valuations?</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm ran through the numbers, explaining why the current state of the venture capital market makes sense for startups and investors alike.</p>
<p>“Today we can make super-expensive startup math work out, provided that growth rates stay generally strong and public-market multiples stay rich,” he writes in The Exchange. “If the latter dips, the former has to improve, and vice versa.”</p>

<p>At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, Norwest Venture Partners‘ Lisa Wu took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business.</p>
<p>The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.</p>
<p>Wu used anecdotes and exercises — such as the eyebrow test — in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>

<p>Jasper Kuria, the managing partner of The Conversion Wizards, breaks down how the CRO consultancy ran an A/B test to boost the conversion rates of a multibillion-dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Radical redesigns that incorporate a large number of variables (instead of single-element tests) are more likely to provide substantial gains,&#8221; Kuria writes. &#8220;Another advantage to doing this is it requires much less time and traffic for your tests to reach statistical significance.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This last weekend featured the much-ballyhooed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">launch of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s first (nonpaying) passengers</a>, with founder and CEO Richard Branson along for the ride. After the festivities, I had the chance to talk with the company&#8217;s president, Mike Moses, who seems to be familiar with every detail of the operation and the company&#8217;s plans for going from test to commercial flights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my recorder went on the fritz, but Moses was kind enough to hop on the phone later in the week to talk (again) about the next generation of spaceplanes, where the company needs to invest, and more. You can read through our conversation below.<em> (Interview has been lightly edited for clarity.)</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TC:</strong> To begin with, can you tell me what&#8217;s left to test, and when do you expect to finish the test flight phase?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> The test flight series that we&#8217;re kind of in right now, and the flight with Richard was the first of those, represents a shift from what was more classic and traditional, envelope testing, where we&#8217;re looking at aerodynamics and trajectories and handling qualities, to more of an operational check-out, where we are validating cabin experience experiences, training procedures, hardware for the folks in the back and what they&#8217;re going to go through.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve laid out a series of a few flights there, three to be specific, that both demonstrate key product milestones and features, as well as allow us time to iterate and develop and optimize some of that back-of-cabin experience. But as always, that&#8217;s a notional schedule, right? The schedule and the numbers are going to depend on the results. So if things go well, we think that&#8217;s a three-flight series if we find things that we need to adjust, we&#8217;ll add more as needed based on what we&#8217;re learning.</p>
<p>Based on the results that we got after Richard and crew came back from the last flight, you know, we know we have some stuff to work on but but everything was pretty much thumbs up.</p>

<p>Now, we know we&#8217;re going to do those flights over the course of this summer and late summer, and then we&#8217;ll be ready to move into, as we announced during our previous earnings call, a &#8216;modification phase&#8217; where we&#8217;re going to do some upgrades on our mothership and our spaceship to prepare them for commercial service. The main focus there is to look at things that allow us to increase the flight-rate frequency. Right now in test, we fly at a fairly slow pace [i.e. infrequently, not at low speed], because we&#8217;re inspecting everything prudently. We&#8217;re going to want to start to move away from that, and as we learn, and so we already know, there&#8217;s some modifications we want to make to enable that to start to happen. We haven&#8217;t set a specific timescale for when that officially ends.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned when we talked at the Spaceport, the crew hadn&#8217;t yet really been debriefed about the experience. I&#8217;m hoping maybe you have a little more information now about recommendations from Sir Richard, from Siriha, from everybody that was actually up there. Have you gotten any substantive feedback that you can share?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we are definitely in the middle of all that feedback and debriefing. As you might imagine, there&#8217;s a lot of data to go through. And in some cases, that data is as simple as the 16 video cameras that we had onboard, and getting them all synced up to see that what&#8217;s happening where, and couple that with live notes, and debriefs, and the audio tracks that went with it. We are definitely gathering up the inputs, but there&#8217;s nothing on that list that I think I&#8217;m ready to disclose at this time. We&#8217;ll keep folks posted as we go.</p>
<p>The general feedback, post-landing both that day and the next day, was &#8216;things were awesome,&#8217; right? Now that&#8217;s not a scientific answer, and I want the scientific answer, so we&#8217;re gonna make them go through the work to debrief.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You touched on this with the &#8216;modification phase&#8217;&#8230; Unity is, I don&#8217;t know how exactly you&#8217;d describe it, a production prototype. Could you tell me whether there&#8217;s any special upkeep for it as the sort of first off the line?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing special as part of its design or build that requires special upkeep. But as a test vehicle and as our first article, we give it a lot of extra attention. We dive in pretty deep on inspections, both regularly and as we see issues, we would probably, test those and explore just to make sure we truly understand that there&#8217;s no unknowns out there, things like how the system performs how it does in cold temperatures, under load and under stress. We keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a series of measurements that we make to say, you know, where did the vehicle perform based on its design envelope. And if we&#8217;re close to the edges of any of that envelope, we go do extra inspections to validate that our modeling and our predictions are right. So in that regard, it&#8217;s pretty similar to how you would have a first set of articles coming out for a new aircraft development, you would build a maintenance and inspection program. That is, an extremely conservative one. And then as you use it, you start to pull out that conservatism based on your positive feedback.</p>
<p>But in general, yes, Unity does get a lot of extra attention. And the next vehicles will have some of that designed in part of that. We&#8217;ve already learned a bunch of, like, &#8216;hey, on the next vehicle, make this different so I don&#8217;t have to look at it every time, I can look at it every five times.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> I think that when we when we talked before, you mentioned that you expect multiple-hundred flights, at least theoretically, out of Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, multiple-hundred flights of the vehicle. We set a design envelope where we designed for a certain lifetime, and we we tested to that, and then we can always go do life extension. Some of that is just a limitation of&#8230; you know, we&#8217;re going to cycle the stuff 10,000 times rather than 40,000 times, and we&#8217;ll come back later and get the other cycles when we get closer to the 10,000 life. We&#8217;ll go back and add more to it. There&#8217;s not a lot of components that have, you know, like a &#8216;fall off the cliff&#8217; type of lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> You mentioned some of the modifications you are going to build into the successor or production craft. Can you tell me any of those, how it will differ in minor or major ways, when you expect weight on wheels and that kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> So we&#8217;ve already done weight on wheels. And we had our rollout, which is effectively that weight on wheels, where we transition from, basically major factory assembly into ground tests. So all of the systems are installed, and now they&#8217;re gonna start to run integrated ground testing, where you can basically go run a computer system through its checkouts, you can run the flight control system through checkouts&#8230; you&#8217;re still on the ground, right, you&#8217;re not yet ready to fly. But we are in that integrated testing.</p>
<p>As far as changes&#8230; when we designed the structure, if you think about it as the skeleton, under the skin, with Imagine and Inspire, we optimized and moved those skeletons, the ribs in the spars, to the locations where the load was highest. Unity was built off of the original design intent of Scaled Composites, and flight tests, they&#8217;ve shown us that sometimes that load is not exactly where it is expected. There&#8217;s a lot of extra weight in Unity to account for that load; Imagine and Inspire, we&#8217;re able to optimize and put the structure right where it needed to be.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a joint, for example, on Unity that I have to go look at every time, because I had to add extra to it. Whereas on Imagine, it was designed to where it should be in the first place. I&#8217;ll still look at it, but it&#8217;s much easier access and a much shorter inspection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178422" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178422" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2178422" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg" alt="VSS Imagine on a runway." width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VSS_IMAGINE_EDIT001-copy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178422" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>
<p>So things like that, that let me optimize my inspection schedule. And other just simplistic things — there are now access panels where we know we need them, whereas we had to kind of add them after the fact in Unity. Your quick release fasteners and things like that, that make inspections shorter, we were able to add into the design, we made a pretty significant number of changes like that, all fairly minor, but they have a large effect on the maintainability of the vehicle.</p>
<p>And the next phase, right, we talked about this, the Delta class of spaceships, we&#8217;re going to make changes for manufacturability. Unity and Inspire and Imagine are still fairly one-off hand-built aircraft — spacecraft, sorry. And if we want to go build a dozen or more to get to these 400-flight-a-year rates, we need to make sure they&#8217;re manufacturable at a smaller price tag in a smaller time scale. So that next design will incorporate a bunch of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> That&#8217;s actually one of the things I wanted to talk about is how you get to the reliability and cadence that you want to have for commercial operation? Obviously, more aircraft is one part of that, but you know, maybe expanding ground ops or crew, better maintenance and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> Yeah, you bet. And I think that&#8217;s it, right: It&#8217;s a fleet, so we have multiple vehicles for dispatch. That gives you capacity to be able to handle anything that comes up unexpected, like weather. And then it&#8217;s the workforce — with more workforce, a 24/7 clock, then you can have multiple expertises, or a crew focused on just one vehicle. And the second crew, they&#8217;re focused on the second one.</p>
<p>I think our mantra here is going to be to take it in baby steps — we&#8217;re not going to try to go to those high flight rates initially, we want to get a little faster, then a little faster, then a little faster. That&#8217;s kind of Unity&#8217;s purpose in life in 2022, to allow us to go explore those operational cadences and see where we can apply multiplying factors for when we get additional spaceships.</p>
<p>You know, the business model is a great one, right? But in these next couple of years, it&#8217;s fairly insensitive to whether I&#8217;m doing eight flights or 10 flights or 12 flights with Unity. I mean, in terms of revenue, it doesn&#8217;t move the needle very much. But in terms of operational learning, that&#8217;s a significant step for us, so we want to be prudent with how we proceed down that path.</p>

<p><strong>TC:</strong> Can you can you tell me again why, or whether, you plan on keeping the flight plans more or less the same? Maybe there&#8217;s possibility, later down the line with the revised version with six people in it, that you might have to have a slightly different profile?</p>
<p><strong>Moses:</strong> That&#8217;s kind of coupled with what we talked about at the beginning of this Q&amp;A, the move from a test phase into this operational readiness phase. Coupled with that is a profile that is now set — the trajectory that the pilots fly, the techniques they use, we&#8217;ll still optimize, but we&#8217;re not making major revisions. Those are all pretty much physics-based results. The airspeed we&#8217;re at, the angles that we&#8217;re at, and the subsequent altitude we get to, the weight we carry, are all kind of locked-in variables, and there&#8217;s not much you can do to change that equation.</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be some definite trajectory changes that come along with Imagine because it will have more capacity on board, which means it&#8217;ll have a slightly different performance, and we just need to go verify that envelope. But for the most part, you know, the physics of the equation kind of set what you can do, roughly speaking, so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re limited to only carrying four passengers here initially. We can change that, and we do plan on looking at weight reductions in the ship, but again, with an eye towards the fleet that we&#8217;re building, and make sure we get a fleet that is serviceable for the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got here. Thanks again for taking the time to chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgages may not be considered sexy, but they are a big business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve refinanced or purchased a home digitally lately, you may not have noticed the company powering the software behind it — but t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s a good chance that company is <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, the startup has steadily grown to be a leader in the mortgage tech industry. Blend’s white label technology powers mortgage applications on the site of banks including Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank, for example, with the goal of making the process faster, simpler and more transparent. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup’s SaaS (software-as-a-service) platform currently processes over $5 billion in mortgages and consumer loans per day, up from nearly $3 billion last July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Blend made its debut as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol “</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BLND?p=BLND&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BLND</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” As of early afternoon, Eastern Time, the stock was trading up over 13% at $20.36.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday night, the company had said it would offer 20 million shares at a price of $18 per share, indicating the company was targeting a valuation of $3.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That compares to a $3.3 billion valuation at the time of its last raise in January &#8212; a $300 million Series G funding round that included participation from Coatue and Tiger Global Management. Also, let’s not forget that Blend only became a unicorn last August when it raised a $75 million Series F. Over its lifetime, Blend had raised $665 million before Friday&#8217;s public market debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In filing its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855747/000119312521194971/d162671ds1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on June 21, Blend revealed that its revenue had climbed to $96 million in 2020 from $50.7 million in 2019. Meanwhile, its net loss narrowed from $81.5 million in 2019 to $74.6 million in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the San Francisco-based startup significantly expanded its digital consumer lending platform. With that expansion, Blend began offering its lender customers </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/14/modular-architecture-powers-blends-expansion-from-mortgage-to-consumer-banking-products/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new configuration capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that they could launch any consumer banking product “in days rather than months</span><b>.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company had said it expects its revenue growth rate “to decline in future periods.” It also doesn’t envision achieving profitability anytime soon as it continues to focus on growth. Blend also revealed that in 2020, its top five customers accounted for 34% of its revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Nima Ghamsari about the company’s decision to go with a traditional IPO versus the ubiquitous SPAC or even a direct listing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Blend said he wanted to show its customers that it is an &#8220;around for a long time company” by making sure there’s enough on its balance sheet to continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to talk and convince some of the biggest investors in the world to invest in us, and that speaks to how long we’ll be around to serve these customers,” he said. “So it was a combination of our capital need and wanting to cement ourselves as a really credible software provider to one of the most regulated industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghamsari emphasized that Blend is a software company that powers the mortgage process and is not the one offering the mortgages. As such, it works with the flock of fintechs that are working to provide mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of them are using Blend under the hood, as the infrastructure layer,” he said.</span></p>
<p>Overall, Ghamsari believes this is just the beginning for Blend.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things about financial services is that it&#8217;s still mostly powered by paper. So a lot of Blend&#8217;s growth is just going deeper into this process that we got started in years ago,&#8221; he said. As mentioned above, the company started out with its mortgage product but just keeps adding to it. Today, it also powers other loans such as auto, personal and home equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our growth is actually powered by our other lines of business,&#8221; Ghamsari told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to build because the larger digitization trends are just getting started in financial services. It&#8217;s a relatively large industry that has lots of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>In May, digital mortgage lender Better.com announced it would combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a service that can help you monitor websites for changes like price drops or other updates, announced that it has raised a $6 million extension to the $2 million seed round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/visualping-which-scans-the-web-for-changes-including-new-vaccination-slots-raises-2-million/">announced</a> earlier this year. The round was led by Seattle-based <a href="https://fuse.vc/">FUSE Ventures</a>, a relatively new firm with investors who <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/investors-ignition-spin-new-seattle-firm-fuse-seahawks-football-star-bobby-wagner/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20investors%20at,up%20Fuse%20as%20general%20partners.">spun out of Ignition Partners</a> last year. Prior investors <a href="https://mistralvp.com/portfolio/">Mistral Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://www.n49p.com/">N49P</a> also participated.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based company is part of the current Google for Startups Accelerator class <a href="https://canada.googleblog.com/2021/03/meet-google-for-startups-accelerator.html">in Canada</a>. This program focuses on services that leverage AI and machine learning, and, while website monitoring may not seem like an obvious area where machine learning can add a lot of value, if you&#8217;ve ever used one of these services, you know that they can often unleash a plethora of false alerts. For the most part, after all, these tools simply look for something in a website&#8217;s underlying code to change and then trigger an alert based on that (and maybe some other parameters you&#8217;ve set).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178691" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/visualping_gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2178691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Visualping</p></div></p>
<p>Earlier this week, Visualping launched its <a href="https://visualping.io/machine-learning">first machine learning-based tools</a> to avoid just that. The company <a href="https://visualping.io/blog/more-signal-less-noise/">argues</a> that it can eliminate up to 80% of false alerts by combining feedback from its more than 1.5 million users with its new ML algorithms. Thanks to this, Visualping can now learn the best configuration for how to monitor a site when users set up a new alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visualping has the hearts of over a million people across the world, as well as the vast majority of the Fortune 500. To be a part of their journey and to lead this round of financing is a dream,” FUSE&#8217;s Brendan Wales said.</p>
<p>Visualping founder and CEO Serge Salager tells me that the company plans to use the new funding to focus on building out its product but also to build a commercial team. So far, he said, the company&#8217;s growth has been primarily product led.</p>
<p>As a part of these efforts, the company also plans to launch Visualping Business, with support for these new ML tools and additional collaboration features, and Visualping Personal for individual users who want to monitor things like ticket availability for concerts or to track news, price drops or job postings, for example. For now, the personal plan will not include support for ML. &#8220;False alerts are not a huge problem for personal use as people are checking two-three websites but a huge problem for enterprise where teams need to process hundreds of alerts per day,&#8221; Salager told me.</p>
<p>The current idea is to launch these new plans in November, together with mobile apps for iOS and Android. The company will also relaunch its extensions around this time, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that while Visualping monetizes its web-based service, you can still use the extension in the browser for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian is pushing back deliveries of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by &#8220;cascading impacts of the pandemic,&#8221; particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips, according to a letter sent to customers from CEO RJ Scaringe. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow &#8220;shortly,&#8221; Scaringe wrote in the message.</p>
<p>Deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition vehicles, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” were<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/"> supposed to begin in July</a> after being delayed by a month.</p>
<p>Rivian is hardly the only automaker grappling with the global chip shortage. GM, Ford, Toyota and virtually every other automaker has either slowed production or built its vehicles without certain features supported by chips. For instance, GM is now building certain mid- and full-sized SUVs without a wireless phone charging feature due to<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the global shortage of semiconductor chips. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike the established players with plenty of inbound revenue, Rivian is a newcomer that is trying to be the first automaker to bring an electric pickup truck to market. Ford plans to bring the electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning pickup truck</a> to market in spring 2022. Production of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV pickup</a> is expected to begin later this year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford unveils the F-150 Lightning, its all-electric pickup truck that will start under $40,000&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/embed/#?secret=oJbQ3uvYOr" data-secret="oJbQ3uvYOr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a segment of the letter, which was viewed by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We know you can&#8217;t wait to get behind the wheel of your vehicle. Earlier this summer, we announced that deliveries would begin in July; however, the timing for the first deliveries of the R1T has shifted to September, with the R1S shortly thereafter in the fall. I wanted to be sure you heard this from me directly.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why our production ramp is taking longer than expected. The cascading impacts of the pandemic have had a compounding effect greater than anyone anticipated. Everything from facility construction, to equipment installation, to vehicle component supply (especially semiconductors) has been impacted by the pandemic. Beyond these unforeseen challenges, launching three new vehicles while setting up a multi-vehicle manufacturing plant is a complex orchestra of coordinated and interlinked activities where small issues can translate into ramp delays.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scaringe provided a few more details about the company&#8217;s progress, including it now employs more than 7,000 people. The Rivian factory in Normal, Illinois, has two separate production lines producing vehicles, according to Scaringe. One is dedicated for the R1 vehicles and other line is for its commercial vans.</p>
<p>In 2019, Rivian announced it was developing an electric delivery van for Amazon using its skateboard platform. Amazon ordered 100,000 of these vans, with deliveries starting in 2021. Earlier this year, Amazon began testing the electric delivery van in Los Angeles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">and San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>Scaringe said Rivian has &#8220;built hundreds of vehicles as part of our validation process, with many of those spotted out in the wild covered in unique vinyl wraps.&#8221; He also addressed why those vehicles haven&#8217;t been delivered to customers, noting that the company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">believes &#8220;it is critical to both our </span>long-term success and your ultimate satisfaction that the quality and robustness of our launch products truly sets the tone for what to expect from us as a brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder and CEO also acknowledged that the company needed to improve how it communicates specifics around deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many blockchain platforms competing for investors&#8217; and developers&#8217; attention right now, from the big daddy of them all, Ethereum, to so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killers&#8221; like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, which we wrote about in May.</p>
<p>Often, these technologies are seen as so promising that investors are willing to fund not only the blockchains but an ecosystem of products and projects that are built on their blockchain networks. On Wednesday, for example, Phantom, a digital wallet that resides on the Solana blockchain network, announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-9m-raise-for-solanas-phantom-wallet-to-go-multi-chain">$9 million</a> in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (which in June also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-startup-solana-raises-314-million-to-develop-faster-blockchain-11623240001">splashed out</a> a lot of money for Solana&#8217;s digital tokens).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0wz327YNyL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/embed/#?secret=0wz327YNyL" data-secret="0wz327YNyL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Similarly, a syndicate of investors today is casting their votes for <a href="https://www.terra.money/">Terraform Labs</a>, a three-year-old platform that originally set out to mint different so-called stablecoins for e-commerce that mimic the value of various fiat currencies and has since expanded its offerings.</p>
<p>There is so much more to be built off the platform, in fact, that backers including Pantera Capital and Arrington XRP have just committed to investing $150 million on products tied to the Terra ecosystem, commitments that will be deployed over several years, says the company, and commitments that, should they prove fruitful, will boost Terraform&#8217;s underlying growth in a kind of virtuous circle.</p>
<p>Why are they so excited about Terraform? The Singapore-based company has apparently been gaining ground fast with merchants in users in South Korea by shortening settlement time from days to seconds, often without e-commerce customers knowing that their online (and sometimes offline) transaction involved a blockchain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been doing so well, says investor Mike Arrington, that it launched an e-commerce wallet called Chai that&#8217;s grown popular in Asia. It also launched <a href="https://mirror.finance/">Mirror Protocol</a>, which creates fungible assets, or “synthetics,&#8221; that track the price of real world assets. (Arrington XRP led Mirror&#8217;s first round.)</p>
<p>Indeed, the market cap of Terraform&#8217;s tokens &#8212; they&#8217;re called LUNA &#8212; has skyrocketed from $300 million in January to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/">$2.6 billion</a> as excited buyers snap them up.</p>
<p>Whether these backers are getting ahead of themselves is an open question, but the company&#8217;s equity investors &#8212; which also include Coinbase Ventures and Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital &#8212; are plainly betting there is more to come.</p>
<p>Back in January, when Galaxy co-led a $25 million round in Terraform, Novogratz <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/novogratz-invests-in-crypto-startup-serving-millions-in-korea.">talked with Bloomberg</a> about the investment. Among other praise heaped on the company, he said that: “What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox. We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dayna Grayson</a> has been in venture capital for more than a decade and was one of the first VCs to build a portfolio around the transformation of industrial sectors of our economy.</p>
<p>At NEA, where she was a partner for eight years, she led investments in and sat on the boards of companies including Desktop Metal, Onshape, Framebridge, Tulip, Formlabs and Guideline. She left NEA to start her own fund, Construct Capital, that focuses exclusively on early-stage startups, with a portfolio that includes Copia, ChargeLab, Tradeswell and Hadrian.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Grayson join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=daynagraysonpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=daynagraysonpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grayson has more than proven that she has a keen eye for transformational technology. Desktop Metal went public in 2020 &#8212; she still sits on the board as chair of the compensation committee. Onshape, another NEA-era investment, was acquired by PTC in 2019 for a whopping $525 million. Framebridge was also acquired by Graham Holdings in 2020.</p>
<p>Grayson saw an opportunity to develop a venture brand more hyperfocused on the types of deals she was doing at NEA, which centered around manufacturing and digitizing industrial verticals. That&#8217;s where Construct Capital came in. It&#8217;s a $140 million fund helmed by Grayson and former Uber exec Rachel Holt.</p>

The Battlefield is one of the world&#8217;s most prestigious and exciting startup competitions. Twenty+ early-stage startups hop on our stage and present their wares to a panel of expert VC judges, who then grill the founders on everything about the business, from the revenue model to the go-to-market strategy to the team to the technology itself.</p>
<p>The winner walks away with $100,000 in prize money and the glory of being a Battlefield winner. Households names in tech have gotten their start in the Battlefield, from Dropbox to Mint.</p>
<p>Grayson joins plenty of other seasoned investors on the Battlefield stage, including Camille Samuels, Deena Shakir, Terri Burns, Shauntel Garvey and Alexa Von Tobel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse at insurance technology startup BackNine exposed hundreds of thousands of insurance applications after one of its cloud servers was left unprotected on the internet.</p>
<p>BackNine might be a company you&#8217;re not familiar with, but it might have processed your personal information if you applied for insurance in the past few years. The California-based company builds back-office software to help bigger insurance carriers sell and maintain life and disability insurance policies. It also offers a white-labeled quote web form for smaller or independent financial planners who sell insurance plans through their own websites.</p>
<p>But one of the company&#8217;s storage servers, hosted on Amazon&#8217;s cloud, was misconfigured to allow anyone access to the 711,000 files inside, including completed insurance applications that contain highly sensitive personal and medical information on the applicant and their family. It also contained images of individuals&#8217; signatures as well as other internal BackNine files.</p>
<p>Of the documents reviewed, TechCrunch found contact information, like full names, addresses and phone numbers, but also Social Security numbers, medical diagnoses, medications taken and detailed completed questionnaires about an applicant&#8217;s health, past and present. Other files included lab and test results, such as blood work and electrocardiograms. Some applications also contained driver&#8217;s license numbers.</p>
<p>The exposed documents date back to 2015, and as recently as this month.</p>
<p>Because Amazon storage servers, known as buckets, are private by default, someone with control of the buckets must have changed its permissions to public. None of the data was encrypted.</p>
<p>Security researcher <a href="http://twitter.com/mayhemdayone">Bob Diachenko</a> found the exposed storage bucket and emailed details of the lapse to the company in early June, but after receiving an initial response, he didn&#8217;t hear back and the bucket remained open.</p>
<p>We reached out to BackNine vice president Reid Tattersall, with whom Diachenko was in contact and ignored. TechCrunch, too, was ignored. But within minutes of providing Tattersall — and him only — with the name of the exposed bucket, the data was locked down. TechCrunch has yet to receive a response from Tattersall, or his father Mark, the company&#8217;s chief executive, who was copied on a later email.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Tattersall if the company has alerted local authorities per state data breach notification laws, or if the company has any plans to notify the affected individuals whose data was exposed. We did not receive an answer. Companies can face stiff financial and civil penalties for failing to disclose a cybersecurity incident.</p>
<p>BackNine works with some of America&#8217;s largest insurance carriers. Many of the insurance applications found in the exposed bucket were for AIG, TransAmerica, John Hancock, Lincoln Financial Group and Prudential. When reached prior to publication, spokespeople for the insurance giants did not comment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[India is on pace for a record year of money flowing into its booming startup sector. But as Q3 gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on in India: public-market liquidity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In case you&#8217;ve not been paying attention, we&#8217;ll say it again: The global venture capital industry is on fire. The second quarter of 2021 was the largest single three-month period on record for dollars invested.</p>
<p>The data coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">points to a </a>worldwide boom. The United States’ startup market had a huge Q2, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">investors don’t expect the pace to slow</a> in the country. Europe is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/as-eu-venture-capital-soars-will-the-region-hold-onto-future-ipos/">also having one hell of a year</a>. Around the world, 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for venture investment into startups. And that&#8217;s after several years of growing, record-breaking results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>India is another good example of this trend. The country’s venture capital haul thus far in 2021 has nearly matched its 2020 total and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">on pace for a record year.</a> But as the third quarter gets underway, something perhaps even more important is going on: public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>The new trend is being spearheaded <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZANwRjRlaV9iQ1NvR1N3MU01bkVESF9BBG5fc3VnZwM5BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM2BHF1ZXJ5A3pvbWF0bwR0X3N0bXADMTYyNjQ0MDMwOA--?p=zomato&amp;fr=techcrunch">by Zomato</a>, an Indian food delivery giant that could be valued at $8.6 billion in its public debut. Other major Indian unicorns are following it to the public markets, including fintech players like <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=AwrEze2SgvFgEYsAI7SnBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDWmJrcDYucTZRWHlyNmFKb1FndXFrQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDNQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM4BHF1ZXJ5A01vYmlLd2lrBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzQ1?p=MobiKwik&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">MobiKwik</a> and <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylt=A0geKaB0gvFgL8wAXKinBWVH;_ylc=X1MDMTE5NzgwMjkxOQRfcgMyBGZyA3RlY2hjcnVuY2gEZ3ByaWQDTEtoMjRhV0RTcG1QWnZveGFaM2ZZQQRuX3JzbHQDMARuX3N1Z2cDOQRvcmlnaW4Dc2VhcmNoLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tBHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAM1BHF1ZXJ5A3BheXRtBHRfc3RtcAMxNjI2NDQwMzM5?p=paytm&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=techcrunch">Paytm</a>, which is backed by Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial. The trio of companies could herald a rush of public offerings from Indian companies if their debuts prove lucrative and stable.</p>
<p>Today, The Exchange is taking a look at India’s recent venture capital results and digging more deeply into the country’s IPO pipeline, with help from VCs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuna1bajaj/">Kunal Bajaj</a> of Blume Ventures and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smanishsinghal/">Manish Singhal</a> of pi Ventures. We’ll also read the tea leaves when it comes to how Zomato’s IPO is performing thus far, and what we can learn from its early data. This will be fun!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jen Young and Jeff Cavins decided to craft a business around their passion for being in nature. They saw an opportunity in the 20 million RVs in the U.S., most used just a few days a year. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jen Young and Jeff Cavins were sitting in a beige conference room at a downtown Vancouver hotel, wasting away under fluorescent lights, an endless PowerPoint and a pair of sad Styrofoam cups of coffee between them. Young was there on a marketing contract. Cavins was a board member. They shared one of those looks that only couples can understand. It said: There’s got to be something better than this.</p>
<p>With 40 years of running technology companies under Cavins’ belt and a successful ad agency career under Young’s, the two decided to craft a business around their shared passion of being out in nature. When they realized there are more than 20 million recreational vehicles all across the U.S., most of which are used only a handful of days, they saw an opportunity. They asked themselves: How do we create memorable outdoor experiences and make them available to everybody?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The sharing economy of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb had already laid the groundwork. Why not open it up to RVs?</p>
<p>In 2014, Young and Cavins invested their life savings into Outdoorsy, sold their homes and jumped into an Airstream Eddie Bauer trailer. For seven months, the couple traveled across the U.S. to do market research on travelers and RV owners to form the basis of their company.</p>
<p>In June, Outdoorsy raised $90 million in a Series D led by ADAR1 Partners, as well as an additional $30 million in debt financing from Pacific Western Bank. The money will be used in large part to accelerate the growth of Outdoorsy’s insurtech business, <a href="https://www.roamly.com/">Roamly</a>. In the same month, the company announced a partnership with glamping company Collective Retreats to expand its outdoor offerings.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve taken a personal approach to your business, spending months in the research phase actually living in an RV and interviewing RV owners and their families around the country. How do you think that&#8217;s shaped your business?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jen Young: </strong>When we lived on the road, we had to experience that customer experience every day for hundreds of days. So this is where we were able to pick up and identify what the biggest pain points were on the renter and the owner side and start tackling those first.</p>
<p>For example, we understood what was most important from an insurance perspective because we could hear the voices of renters and owners &#8212; they consider these things their babies in many cases.</p>
<p>The owners that are more entrepreneurial-minded, they consider them more of a business asset, but both of them want to know, &#8220;What am I going to get for liability insurance? Comp and collision? Interior damage?&#8221; The detailed list of those things became the beginning of the product roadmap, as well as itemizing what things have to occur for a good guest experience.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways have you had to pivot your model based on how people have used your platform? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cavins: </strong>One of the things we learned is most renters don&#8217;t want to drive these things, so owners started to do delivery, which became very popular on our platform. Sixty percent of all owners now will just deliver and set up for you so you can arrive at your campsite and everything&#8217;s just done. Your chairs are out, your barbecue is out, your awning is out and maybe a bottle of champagne in your fridge for you.</p>
<p>When Jen and I were traveling last year, we saw that most of the American landscape of campgrounds and campsites were overbooked. People couldn&#8217;t get their reservations closed the way that you would expect in a world of technologically evolved industries, and we thought there had to be something better in terms of the customer experience for camping, which really catalyzed our investment in glamping company Collective Retreats.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance Retail said on Friday it has acquired a controlling stake in 25-year-old Indian search and discovery firm Just Dial for $469 million.</p>
<p>The Indian retail giant, which leads the market, said it has acquired a 41% stake in the publicly listed Just Dial for $469 million and will make an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake later. VSS Mani, founder and chief executive of Just Dial, will continue his leadership role at the firm, both the companies said in a joint press release.</p>
<p>Just Dial offers local search and e-commerce services through its website, mobile apps and telephone line. Users in India can inquire about local plumbers, details for hotels and housekeeping services among other things by just dialing 8888888888.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The decades-old firm &#8212; which prior to entering the public markets raised about $102 million from Tiger Global, Elevation Capital, Sequoia Capital India, Sapphire Ventures and Nalanda Capital &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has built a massive database whose results are so useful and relevant that they often populate top search queries on Google and other search engines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The service is free for users, but Just Dial charges businesses and individual service providers a fee for listing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178603" style="width: 2034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178603 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg" alt="" width="2024" height="1464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg 2024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=768,556 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=1536,1111 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/justdial.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178603" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab of Just Dial website.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly 25 years ago, we had a vision to build a connected single platform dedicated to providing fast, free, reliable and comprehensive information to our users and connect buyers to sellers,&#8221; said Mani.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision has evolved to not only provide search and discovery but drive commerce across merchants through our B2B platform and enable further consumer to merchant commerce given our platform engagement. Our strategic partnership with Reliance enables us to realize this vision and transform the business going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just Dial&#8217;s acquisition is one of many Reliance Industries &#8212; or its subsidiaries including telecom giant Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail that together raised over $27 billion last year from marquee investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">including Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; has made in recent quarters.</p>
<p>In August, Reliance acquired a 60% stake in pharma marketplace Netmeds’ parent firm Vitalic for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/indias-reliance-retail-acquires-a-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-nedmeds-for-83-2m/">about $83.2 million</a>. In November, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/14/reliance-retail-buys-urban-ladder-for-24-4-million/">online furniture startup Urban Ladder for $24.4 million</a> in a distress sale.</p>
<p>Last year, Reliance Retail also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">entered into a $3.4 billion deal with Future Group</a> to buy several of India’s second-largest retail chain’s businesses. The deal, which has yet to close, is at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/indian-court-rejects-retail-giant-future-groups-plea-against-amazon/">centre of lawsuits with American e-commerce giant Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reliance is excited to partner with Justdial and Mr. VSS Mani, a first-generation entrepreneur, who has created a strong business through his business acumen and perseverance,&#8221; said Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investment in Just Dial underlines our commitment to New Commerce by further boosting the digital ecosystem for millions of our partner merchants, micro, small and medium enterprises. We look forward to working with the highly experienced management team of Just Dial as we further expand the business going forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to M&amp;A in the chip world, the numbers are never small. In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">four deals involving chip companies</a> totaled $106 billion, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia snagging ARM for $40 billion</a>. One surprise from last year&#8217;s chip-laced M&amp;A frenzy was <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a> remaining on the sidelines. That would change if a rumored $30 billion deal to buy chip manufacturing concern <a href="http://globalfoundries.com">GlobalFoundries</a> comes to fruition.</p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704?st=a6n89h1nc4cteyd&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported by The Wall Street Journal</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, who watches the chip industry closely, says that snagging GlobalFoundries would certainly make sense for Intel. The company is currently pursuing a new strategy to manufacture and sell chips for both Intel and to others under CEO Pat Gelsinger, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">who came on board in January</a> to turn around the flagging chip maker.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RlXTVoPRFU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/embed/#?secret=RlXTVoPRFU" data-secret="RlXTVoPRFU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;GlobalFoundries has technologies and processes that are specialized for 5G RF, IoT and automotive. Intel with GlobalFoundries would become what I call a &#8216;full-stack provider&#8217; that could offer a customer everything. This is in full alignment with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> (Intel&#8217;s chip manufacturing strategy) and would get Intel there years before it could without GlobalFoundries,&#8221; Moorhead told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It would also give Intel a chip manufacturing facility at a time when there are global chip shortages and huge demand for product from every corner, due in part to the pandemic and the impact it has had on the global supply chain. Intel has already indicated it has plans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/intel-is-spending-20-billion-to-build-two-new-chip-plants-in-arizona.html">to spend more than $20 billion</a> to build two fabs (chip manufacturing plants) in Arizona. Adding GlobalFoundries to these plans would give them a broad set of manufacturing capabilities in the coming years if it came to pass, but would also involve a significant investment of tens of billions of dollars to get there.</p>
<p>GlobalFoundries is a worldwide chip manufacturing concern based in the U.S. The company was spun off from Intel&#8217;s rival chip maker AMD in 2012, and is currently owned by <a href="https://www.mubadala.com/en/who-we-are/about-the-company">Mubadala Investment Company</a>, the investment arm of the government of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Investors seem to like the idea of combining these two companies, with Intel stock up 1.59% as of publication. It&#8217;s important to note that this deal is still in the rumor stage and nothing is definitive or final yet. We will let you know if that changes.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole crew was here this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> together with Grace and Chris to sort through a very, very busy week. Yep, somehow it is Friday again, which means it&#8217;s time for our weekly news roundup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got to in our short window of time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Jianzhi Education IPO:</strong> We have questions. The Chinese edtech company is <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/jianzhi-education-is-first-chinese-firm-to-file-to-list-in-us-after-regulators-propose-vetting-overseas-ipos">looking to list</a> in the United States after Chinese regulators clamped down on Didi and other China-based, American public offerings. Bravery? Stupidity? Brilliance? It&#8217;s hard to say, but we&#8217;ll be watching.</li>
<li><strong>Zomato&#8217;s IPO and the Indian tech scene:</strong> As Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">puts the final touches on its impending public offering</a>, we chatted about the listing and what it may mean for the larger, red-hot Indian startup market.</li>
<li><strong>The AI conversation:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">ZoomInfo bought Chorus.ai this week</a>, which we had lots to say about, especially in light of Gong&#8217;s epic valuation. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord bought Sentropy</a>, which also uses AI, albeit for a very different purpose.

<li><strong>Apple vs. Startups:</strong> That&#8217;s the gist of our chat about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2177976&amp;preview=true">the BNPL space and Apple&#8217;s possible invasion of the hot startup market</a>. In short, who&#8217;s at risk? We have a few ideas.</li>

					<description><![CDATA["When a VC says they don't like an LLC, they literally mean they are definitely allergic to peanuts, and you are a bowl of nuts."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch virtually sat down with venture capitalist and <a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a> managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Sarah Kunst</a> at our latest Early Stage event last week. Kunst joined us to chat about preparing for raising capital in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">today&#8217;s frenetic fundraising environment</a>, digging into the gritty mechanics for the audience.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital invests $500,000 to $1 million into early-stage startups, with portfolio companies that include mmhmm, Cameo and StyleSeat, among others.</p>
<p>Next, a few favorite excerpts from the chat, starting with Kunst&#8217;s notes on how to make a killer pitch deck. Questions from the audience helped direct the conversation, so I&#8217;ve tried to select themes that came from y&#8217;all. We&#8217;ll also explore advice regarding incorporation, how to find a co-founder and when startups are too large to join an accelerator. (Quotes lightly edited for clarity.)</p>
<p>Before we get into key points from the conversation, here&#8217;s a rundown of links that Kunst discussed that I promised to include in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10 slide deck</a></li>

<li>Y Combinator&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/">documents hub</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://lunchclub.ai/?invite_code=sarahk1">LunchClub</a> with Kunst&#8217;s invite code attached</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst">Kunst&#8217;s Twitter account</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make a great pitch deck</h2>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s the thing about decks: Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly. Don&#8217;t be ugly.</p>
<p>The good news is it is free and easy to make a non-ugly deck. It is not 1999. You do not have to use clip art. You can go to Canva. You can go to plenty of websites that give you very basic, very cheap &#8212; if not free &#8212; very simple decks. Just use one. It doesn&#8217;t have to change the world. But it can&#8217;t be ugly. No Comic Sans font, unless you&#8217;re a deeply ironic meme-driven company. And even then, the odds that that joke will land are infinitesimal. So, just don&#8217;t have an ugly deck.</p>
<p>What should be in your deck? Again, this will be a link that we&#8217;ll have later, but I love for really early-stage companies to use <a href="https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s 10-slide pitch-deck format</a>. Do not send me something that is a video. Do not send me something that is a one-pager. Do not send me something that&#8217;s 100-pager. [I want] 10 slides. Don&#8217;t make me download anything. Attached as a PDF, use DocSend.</p>
<p>Make it really, really, really simple and really easy to read and digest who you are, what the problem is [you are tackling], what the solution is, why you&#8217;re the right team to do it, what your traction is, how much you&#8217;re raising, [and] maybe a product slide. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all I need to know. I&#8217;ll take the meeting or I won&#8217;t. And I say that on behalf of every other VC and angel in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice is clear and should help you avoid some common pitfalls. Everything that she said not to do, I promise she&#8217;s had sent to her. Don&#8217;t be the next thing that gets deleted. Do what she said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How to find a co-founder</h2>
<blockquote><p>Look back through everybody you know. This is sort of the same [as] when we get to the friends and family part of fundraising. Really go back and say, <em>Who do I know?</em> Not, <em>Who are my best friends</em>, or <em>who was at my wedding.</em> Take a much broader look. And think about the intern you always sat next to who was an engineer &#8212; what are they up to now? Your college roommate&#8217;s boyfriend or girlfriend who was a great compsci major. What are they doing now? Tweet about it, reach out on social media, reach out on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m obsessed with LinkedIn. If you keep your network up to date, you can literally go search <em>who do you know who&#8217;s a computer scientist</em>? First-degree, second-degree connections [are great]. Then just reach out to people and say, <em>Hey, we&#8217;d love to chat with you.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vyrill helps brands discover and leverage video reviews created by authentic customers and users. The company presented its product at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising, where it beat out nine other companies, winning the pitch-off. The judges were impressed with Vyrill&#8217;s novel approach and innovative technology around discovering and filtering relevant videos.</p>
<p>This is a struggle for companies of every size. User-generated content is highly sought after as its authenticity is often apparent and therefore powerful. But the challenge is finding the ideal video quickly and efficiently. Right now, that usually involves searching for a video based on its title and then screening the entire video &#8212; a process that&#8217;s haphazard and labor-intensive.</p>
<p>As Vyrill&#8217;s CEO Ajay Bam stressed during his presentation, brands increasingly turn to ordinary people for video advertising. Instead of slick marketing videos, brands are more often licensing and marketing content created by real-life product users. But discovery is challenging and the search tools built into video platforms only parse the text in the title and description. Vyrill claims to have the solution. For example, with Vyrill&#8217;s technology, L&#8217;Oréal can match millions of YouTube videos to their entire product catalog, organizing each video to the appropriate product category. This enables L&#8217;Oréal to identify and utilize the best user-generated videos for the company&#8217;s marketing purposes. In addition, with Vyrill&#8217;s system, L&#8217;Oréal can dig down and identify user-generated content specific to a particular product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vyrill&#8217;s system analyzes the videos and parses the video&#8217;s text, audio and images against a handful of filters, including diversity, subject matter, engagement and more. According to Vyrill, this system is the secret sauce, enabling brands to discover the best videos quickly. The system also helps brands connect with the content creators by displaying profiles and email addresses.</p>
<p>CEO Ajay Bam said during his presentation the company currently has 40 companies on its platform, and it&#8217;s doubling month over month. Bam and co-founder and CTO Dr. Barbara Rosario started the company in 2015 and raised a $2.1 million pre-seed round in 2018. The company is currently fundraising a seed round with $1.2 million already raised.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app, raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yummy, a Venezuela-based delivery app on a mission to create the super app for the country, announced Friday it raised $4 million in funding to expand its dark store delivery operations across Latin America.</p>
<p>Funding backers included Y Combinator, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, Canary, Hustle Fund, Necessary Ventures and the co-founders of TaskUs. The total investment includes pre-seeding capital raised in 2020.</p>
<p>“This appears to be a contrarian bet, but Yummy has quickly become the No. 1 super app in Venezuela and proven that the team can scale the business in a difficult territory,” Mateen said in a statement. “Now Vicente and the rest of the Yummy team will expand into more traditional markets with the necessary experience and support to overcome inevitable challenges that they will face.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vicente Zavarce, Yummy’s founder and CEO, launched the company in 2020 and is currently part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort. Born in Venezuela, Zavarce came to the U.S. for school and stayed to work in growth marketing at Postmates, Wayfair and Getaround before starting Yummy. Zavarce was a remote CEO over the past year, stuck in the U.S. due to travel restrictions, but said he is making the most of it.</p>
<p>Yummy’s app can be downloaded for free, and the company charges a delivery fee or merchant fee. In contrast to some of his food delivery competitors, Zavarce told TechCrunch Yummy’s fees are “the lowest in the market” so they do not affect the merchant’s ability to use the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178272" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178272" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178272 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png 1875w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=768,371 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=680,329 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=1536,742 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Order-Heartmap-Angle-2.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178272" class="wp-caption-text">Yummy order heat map. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yummy</p></div></p>
<p>The company is pulling together additional key components for its super app strategy, which includes launching a ridesharing vertical this year. Yummy has already connected more than 1,200 merchants with hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>
<p>And, over the past year the company completed more than 600,000 deliveries of food, groceries, alcohol and shopping. It reached $1 million in monthly gross merchandise volume while also growing 38% in revenue month over month.</p>
<p>Over the past eight years, the political and economic challenges faced by the country have led to its recent adoption of the U.S. dollar, Zavarce said. In some cases up to 70% of transactions are happening in dollars on the ground. He said this has protected the business against hyperinflation and ultimately created the opportunity for startups to begin operating in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Because of that, combined with more consumer technology innovation over the past decade, Zavarce said there is no reason why Venezuela should not have the best last-mile logistics. It’s there that Yummy has an opportunity to connect multiple vertices into a super app with little to no competition.</p>
<p>“Eventually, other players will enter, but because we have a super app, we already have an amazing frequency of usage,” he added. “We also already have exclusivity with 60% of the food delivery marketplace, which has enabled us to build a moat around the market. We believe we are the right people to execute on this and feel it is our responsibility to do it.”</p>
<p>Plans for the new funding include user acquisition — the company has close to 200,000 registered users already — and to expand in Peru and Chile by August. At the same time, Zavarce will spend some of that capital to attract more users across Venezuela. He also expects to be in Ecuador and Bolivia by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.halla.io/">Halla</a> wants to answer the question of how people decide what to eat, and now has $4.5 million in fresh Series A1 capital from Food Retail Ventures to do it.</p>
<p>Headquartered in New York, Halla was founded in 2016 by Gabriel Nipote, Henry Michaelson and Spencer Price to develop “taste intelligence,” using human behavior to steer shoppers to food items they want while also discovering new ones as they shop online. This all results in bigger basket orders for stores. SOSV and E&amp;A Venture Capital joined in on the round, which brings Halla’s total capital raised to $8.5 million, CEO Price told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company’s API technology is a plug-and-play platform that leverages more than 100 billion shopper and product data points and funnels it into three engines: Search, which takes into account a shopper’s preferences; Recommend, which reveals relevant complementary products as someone shops; and Substitute, which identifies replacement options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halla’s Substitute product was released earlier this year as an answer to better recommendations for out-of-stock items that even <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2021/walmart-uses-predictive-ai-for-grocery-substitutions/">retailers like Walmart are creating technology to solve</a>. Price cited a McKinsey report that found 20% of grocery shoppers sought out competitors following a negative outcome from bad substitutions.</p>

<p>None of these data points are linked to any shoppers’ private data, just the attributes around the shopping itself. The APIs, rather, are looking for context to return relevant recommendations and substitutions. For example, Halla’s platform would take into account the way someone adds items to their cart and suggest next ones: if you added turkey and then bread, the platform may suggest cheese and condiments.</p>
<p>“It’s also about personalization when it comes to grocery shopping and food,” Price said. “When you want organic eggs from a specific brand and it is out of stock, it is often up to your personal shopper’s discretion. We want to lead them to the right substitutions, so you can still cook the meal you intended instead of ‘close enough.’ ”</p>
<p>Halla’s technology is now live in more than 1,100 e-commerce storefronts. The new funding gives Halla some fuel for the fire Price said is happening within the company, including plans to double the number of stores it supports across accounts. He also expects to double employees to 30 in order to support growth and customer base, admitting there is “more inbound interest that we can handle.” Halla has been busy fast-tracking big customers for pilots, and at the same time, wants to expand internationally with additional product lines over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>The company is also seeing “a near infinite increase in recurring revenue,” as it attracts six- and seven-figure contracts that push the company closer to cash flow positivity. All of that growth is positioning Halla for a Series B if it needs it, Price said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as part of the investment, Food Retail Ventures’ James McCann will join Halla’s board of directors.</p>
<p>McCann, who only invests in food and retail technology, told TechCrunch that grocery stores need a way to inspire shoppers, that Halla is doing that and in a better way than other intelligence versions he has seen.</p>
<p>“Their technology is miles ahead of everyone else,” he added. “They have a terrific team and a terrific product. They are seeing huge uplifts in terms of suggestions and what people are buying, and their measurements are out of this world.”</p>
