										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.manomano.com">ManoMano</a> has raised a Series F funding round of $355 million led by Dragoneer Investment Group. The company operates an e-commerce platform focused on DIY, home improvement and gardening products. It is currently available in six European countries. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to Dragoneer Investment Group, Temasek, General Atlantic, Eurazeo, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Aglaé Ventures, Kismet Holdings and Armat Group are also participating.</p>
<p>“We operate in Europe and we are the industry leader in online sales,” co-founder and co-CEO Philippe de Chanville told me. In France in particular, the company has been profitable for a couple of years already. In 2020 alone, the company’s gross merchandise volume <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/manomanos-sales-are-growing-rapidly-for-its-home-improvement-e-commerce-platform/">doubled</a> to €1.2 billion ($1.42 billion at today’s rate).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So why did the company raise given that it’s already in a strong position to replicate the same model in other European markets? Because they could and because they didn’t need to. With a high valuation, ManoMano could raise quite a bit of money without having to sell a significant chunk of its equity.</p>
<p>In addition to France, the startup operates in Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany and the U.K. With today’s funding round, the company wants to develop its activities in the U.K. and Germany in particular — they are Europe’s two biggest markets for home improvement and gardening.</p>
<p>ManoMano sells products to hobbyists and also targets the B2B market with <a href="https://www.manomano.fr/pro">ManoManoPro</a>. It’s already working well in France with very small teams (1 to 5 employees) and the company is expanding this offering to Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>The startup will also invest more heavily in its product and build a better logistics infrastructure. “For the logistics part, we work with third-party logistics companies — we are a tech company,” co-founder and co-CEO Christian Raisson told me.</p>
<p>ManoMano doesn’t have its own warehouses and doesn’t own any inventory. That’s why ManoMano plans to recruit 1,000 people over the next 18 months and most of them will be tech profiles.</p>
<p>While ManoMano has 7 million clients, sales of home improvement and gardening items still mostly happen in brick-and-mortar stores. The startup is well aware that it’s not just a matter of having the best products at good price points.</p>
<p>ManoMano works with advisors (or Manodvisors) so that experts can give advice whenever customers need some tips. Overall, customers have initiated 2.3 million conversations with advisors in 2020. Recommendations and advice will be key to gain market shares. And the company is now well capitalized to innovate on this front and differentiate itself from other e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following on from mid-June when first-time buyer mortgage lending startup <a href="https://www.generationhome.com/">Generation Home</a> raised a $30.4m Series A round and a £300m loan facility from NatWest, it’s now adding to its board.</p>
<p>Although known for becoming an Angel investor since leaving Monzo, the challenger bank startup he co-founded, <a href="https://twitter.com/t_blom">Tom Blomfield</a> hasn’t joined any startup boards.</p>
<p>That changes today with the news that he is joining Generation Home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup launched last year with radically a different model for home buying – effectively allowing relatives to become co-equity holders in the properties their children bought, and go along for the ride.</p>
<p>Generation Home founder and CEO Will Rice says the platform, therefore, unlocks far larger amounts of capital from &#8216;the bank of mum and dad’ than normally happens when money is loaned or gifted to the next generation.</p>
<p>The UK property problem is acute. According to the English Housing Survey 2020, the average U.K. renter spends 35% of their income on rent compared with 18% for homeowners paying a mortgage. High rents inhibit their ability to save and house price inflation locks more people out of homeownership.</p>
<p>Using Generation Home, parents can contribute deposits as an equity loan. Generation Home then takes responsibility for the repayment of funds to the parents upon a sale of the property or remortgage. Repayment of the loan can also be triggered once the homeowner’s equity in the property reaches a pre-agreed level, and the value of the loan can reflect changes in the house price. Plus the loan can be converted into a gift at any time, through the Generation Home platform.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch about his move to join the board, Blomfield said: “I met Will last year and what really excites me was the product. I think it&#8217;s so relevant, and it hasn&#8217;t really been covered in the mainstream press much. The problem with first-time buyers, trying to get a mortgage, is that they almost invariably rely on help from their parents or sometimes their friends to help. I’ve had experience with this and a lot of people actually mean it as a loan and they intend to get that money back. But mortgage lenders make you sign a piece of paper saying this is an absolute gift. So hundreds of thousands of parents around the country are basically committing a &#8211; well-intentioned &#8211; fraud to help their kids get on the property ladder. So what I loved about the Generation Home product is that they&#8217;ve got this new legal structure where parents can effectively lend that money towards the deposit, but it&#8217;s structured as a loan if they want it to be. They have the right to get their money back eventually without having to lie. So that&#8217;s one thing that really really attracted me to the company. It’s just so so relevant to everyone, and people are just kind of blind to this problem.”</p>
<p>I asked him if he thinks there’s a “Monzofication” of FinTech business models in FinTech, as suggested by the success of Monzo’s model, where the user is put front and centre?</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s certainly a lot in common between what we do at Monzo and what Generation Home is trying to do. Big mortgage lenders focus on the mortgage product and the customer is like an inconvenience. As a customer you have to fit with whatever the mortgage provider will offer you and it&#8217;s totally inflexible. It’s very similar with Monzo &#8211; we tried to flip it around, and focus on what customers really want and care about every day. Simple stuff like notifications when you spend money or alerts before you go into overdraft &#8211; those are now commonplace and they weren&#8217;t, five, six years ago. I think Generation Home is doing the same thing which is focusing on the stuff that customers really, really care about, and then providing that flexibility and more features to meet their needs, rather than just raming everyone into the straitjacket of what a mortgage is doing,” he said.</p>

<p>Nirman Dave’s two startups are very different, but both have a DIY spirit. The first, called CircuiTricks and founded during his gap year after high school, created kits to teach students about electronics and physics. Now Dave is chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.obviously.ai/">Obviously AI</a>, a no code AI/ML platform that enables people without technical backgrounds to build and train machine learning models. The Berkeley-based company has raised a seed extension that brings the round’s total to $4.7 million, up from the $3.6 million<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/03/2221406/0/en/No-code-AI-company-Obviously-AI-announces-3-6m-in-seed-funding-from-TMV-B-Capital-Group-and-notable-individuals.html"> it announced two months ago</a>. The extension was led by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/utec-one-of-asias-largest-deep-tech-investment-firms-launches-new-275m-fund">University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a>, a deep tech investment firm, with participation from Trail Mix Ventures and B-Capital.</p>
<p>UTEC principal Kiran Mysore told TechCrunch that he found Obviously AI on Product Hunt while helping a friend without an AI/ML or coding background build machine learning models. After using Obviously AI and benchmarking it against other AutoML products, Mysore was so impressed that he reached out to the startup and led the investment round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No code/low code startups have gained a lot of attention—and funding—over the past year. Some notable examples are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/noogata-raises-12m-seed-round-for-its-no-code-enterprise-ai-platform/">Noogata</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/">Abacus</a>. Dave says Obviously AI’s niche is mid-market businesses that don’t have a data science team, or have people who know data analytics but are not programmers.</p>

<p>Obviously AI uses proprietary technology called “Edge-Sharp AutoML” to build and train machine learning models that are customized to their clients’ needs, and can be integrated into their existing cloud services and databases. It focuses on marketing, software, direct-to-consumer, fintech and insurance companies, and currently has more than 3,000 clients, who have used more than 82,000 predictive models hosted on Obviously AI’s model.</p>
<p>Its new seed funding will be used to expand in Asian markets including Japan, where it will partner with client Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), one of the country’s largest printing companies, on its go-to-market strategy.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Takeya Shimomura, research and development manager at Dai Nippon Printing, said, &#8220;At DNP, cutting edge predictive analytics for marketing and sales is very important to us. However, the tools today are very complicated and take months to get results. With Obviously AI, we were able to onboard several of our analysts seamlessly and got up and running in just a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave met Obviously AI’s co-founder and chief technology officer Tapojit Debnath while both were international students at Hampshire College. After graduating, they started internships at startups in the Bay Area. Dave was a data science intern at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/streamlabs/">Streamlabs</a>, the live-streaming software platform.</p>
<p>Originally hired to work on video encoding algorithms, Dave also spent a lot of time building machine learning models for the company’s marketing and sales team. Debnath, who was a machine learning intern at retail software startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/b8ta/">B8ta</a>, had a similar experience.</p>
<p>The two realized there is a talent shortage of machine learning engineers, and many companies rely on “citizen data analysts,” or people who understand data science, but don’t have coding experience.</p>

<p>“These are people that work with a lot of data but they’re not programmers themselves, and these are the kind of folks we designed these tools for. The goal is that you understand the data, and you can take that data and use the software to build a model really fast, without waiting for hours or days,” said Dave.</p>
<p>He and Debnath quit their jobs in 2018 to start working on the startup, <a href="https://www.obviously.ai/post/airbnb-garage">doing chores for their Airbnb host in exchange for rent</a> while learning how to pitch to investors, before joining U.C. Berkeley’s SkyDeck accelerator program.</p>
<p>Dave said that many auto AI/ML software platforms “brute forces a bunch of different algorithms on a data set, and picks one that performs the best.” For example, they might run 100 different algorithms before picking the one that performs the best, which means the time spent automatically building the other algorithms is wasted.</p>
<p>What Obviously AI’s Edge-Sharp AutoML does differently is look at a specific group of machine learning models that can be used on a data set before automatically shortlisting the top five models for a client’s needs, automatically tuning their hyperparameters and returning prediction results.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=bk74eBlJPG" data-secret="bk74eBlJPG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Obviously AI’s pricing plans start at $75 a month. Its typical clients are mid-sized businesses or small teams in larger businesses that don’t have a data science team, or whose data scientists are preoccupied with other work.</p>
<p>For example, a small microlending company in India with a team of about 15 people was manually deciding which applicants to give loans to when they decided to switch to AI models. They started using Obviously AI to automatically predict the chances of an applicant defaulting and how much they should be loaned. Now the company uses Obviously AI end-to-end in their app, which means customers can see the size of a loan they are likely to get immediately after applying.</p>
<p>Another use case is a German mobile gaming company that wanted to use a dynamic pricing model and needed to figure out how much individual users would be willing to pay for products like in-game tokens. They use Obviously AI to make that prediction based on a player’s interaction with a game.</p>
<p>Part of Obviously AI&#8217;s seed funding will be used on machine learning research and development to serve more use cases. Dave said that Obviously AI focuses on supervised learning use cases, where clients have data and know what to predict. Unsupervised use cases are where they have a data set, but don’t know exactly what they want, and use machine learning models to tell them if there are any interesting patterns in it. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for things like automatic categorization or recommendation engines on e-commerce platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As firework volleys launched out of New York City harbor last night, a very different celebration was likely taking place just a few blocks down the street at Verizon’s official headquarters in Midtown.</p>
<p>The telco, which owns TechCrunch for hopefully just a few more weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">pending the close of the Apollo acquisition of our parent company Verizon Media</a>, announced overnight that it had signed an agreement with Z Holdings, a division of Japan’s SoftBank Group, to sell trademarks within the Japan market around the Yahoo brand and related tech infrastructure for approximately $1.6 billion.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TKX7eoQ62S"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/embed/#?secret=TKX7eoQ62S" data-secret="TKX7eoQ62S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The extremely descriptive Z Holdings owns SoftBank’s internet businesses in Japan, most notably Yahoo Japan, whose web portal remains the country’s most trafficked news website. Under its most current agreement with Verizon Media (formerly Oath, formerly AOL + Yahoo), Yahoo Japan paid a regular royalty for the rights to use the Yahoo brand name in Japan and associated technologies. Those royalties will now stop in lieu of a one-time upfront payment.</p>
<p>The resolution of the agreement was one of the key nuances left to figure out in Apollo’s $5 billion buyout of Verizon Media. The deal will give Verizon significant additional consideration as it works to pare down its debt load acquired from a spending spree on wireless spectrum auctions, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-announces-c-band-auction-results">such as its $52.9 billion acquisition of C-band spectrum earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>In a press statement from Z Holdings, the company said that “Although the Yahoo Japan License Agreement will be terminated, Yahoo Japan and Verizon Media will retain their cooperative business and technology relationship. Yahoo Japan will continue to deliver more convenient and innovative services under the ‘Yahoo! JAPAN’ brand, based on its mission statement: ‘UPDATE JAPAN.’” Expect further patches to Japan to be delivered shortly, I guess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy 4th of July! For those of you who are actually checking your emails today while getting some sun at an overcrowded beach or diligently grilling hot dogs, welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirsten Korosec, your usual host, is off enjoying the great American outdoors, so please enjoy this takeover all the way from Auckland, New Zealand! Despite the winter chill down under and my singularity as an American on this island, I’m feeling particularly patriotic today. It was on this day 245 years ago that the 13 colonies declared themselves free and independent states, with all the power to establish commerce and pursue happiness and what not. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I sit here, a journalist, with a front row seat to the history of technological advancement, I can’t help but notice that the spirit of the Declaration of Independence, one that rebuffs authority for freedom to act as one chooses, is alive and well in the startup world. Technology, even in the transportation space, soars ever upward, unshackled in many cases by corresponding rules and regulations, and the government hastens to catch up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t know what I mean? I had a conversation today with </span><b>Lacuna</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO Hugh Martin, and he mentioned something that stayed with me and found its way into this rant. Venture capital is pouring into startups creating technology like eVTOL, air taxis, rockets and drones, but consider this: What is the ratio of startups building such futuristic tech compared to departments of transportation with aviation departments? Public private partnerships need to step up, and fast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, rant over. Enjoy your firecrackers. </span></p>

<p><b>Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is having a tough week, pulling operations in San Francisco and Santa Monica, as well as Zaragoza in Spain. Both California cities had new scooter permits beginning on July 1, but there hasn’t been a Bird in sight since June 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco, Bird goes by Scoot, the company it acquired in June 2019 that has been in SF for around a decade. </span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/san-francisco-smacks-down-scooter-startups-bird-and-lime"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird previously operated in the city, but was kicked out </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2018, along with Lime, so this was an off-hand way of making it back into the Golden City. This time around, the </span><a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/powered-scooters-charge-citys-transportation-recovery"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFMTA is asking Bird to halt its operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even as the 2021 permit program begins without it, and is also levying fines to the tune of $105,600 against the company. Apparently, Bird got caught implementing its fleet manager program with unauthorized subcontractors. The permit does allow for scooter companies to use subcontractors, but they need prior approval and proof of insurance, which Bird did not provide for at least three subcontractors. The SFMTA is currently deferring its decision on letting Bird back in until it has conducted an investigation into the matter.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scoot is proud to have partnered with the city for nearly a decade providing shared micro electric vehicles for San Francisco,” a Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are cooperating fully with the SFMTA to swiftly resolve the clerical error that occurred while urgently providing existing local businesses an alternative source of revenue during the pandemic. We apologize for the inconvenience to our riders during this evaluation period and are eager to once again serve San Francisco residents and visitors as soon as possible.” </span></p>
<p><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the other hand, have been asked to stay in San Francisco, so congrats to them. They’ll also be operating in </span><a href="https://www.smdp.com/after-appeal-and-litigation-threat-bird-still-receives-boot-from-santa-monica/206315"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Monica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where Bird was again not chosen for the 2021 scooter program in large part because the city found Bird’s service to be lacking in safety and rider features, affordability and customer service, according to the Santa Monica selection committee scorecard shared with TechCrunch. The company filed an appeal and threatened litigation back in May, but was denied this week and basically told it didn’t have a legal basis for suing, according to letters between Bird’s attorneys and the City of Santa Monica shared with TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><b>Veo </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>Wheels </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">will also be operating in Santa Monica. Meanwhile in Spain, the </span><a href="https://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/11295435/06/21/el-ayuntamiento-de-zaragoza-impide-operar-a-bird-al-negarle-la-prorroga-en-la-autorizacion-de-servicio-actual.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza City Council asked Bird to cease operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from September onward due to noncompliance issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Veo, the company has been on a bit of a roll after winning the New York permit. This week, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veo-unveils-first-ever-e-scooters-with-turn-signals-available-for-purchase-301105857.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veo unveiled what might be the industry’s first e-scooter with integrated turn signals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sweet new safety feature that hopefully the rest of the industry will pick up on. Veo will deploy these scooters in Santa Monica and NYC next week. </span></p>

Its new Hadean Series skateboard can zoom up to 31 mph, and its battery can go up to 42 miles on a single charge.

Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<p><strong>Mayors from nine American cities</strong>, including Los Angeles and Denver, sent a letter on June 30 urging federal lawmakers to include funds for planning grants for advanced air mobility (AAM) in the massive infrastructure legislation currently being debated in Congress. The letter, shared with TechCrunch by a source familiar with the matter, argues that federal grant funding for planning studies would help cities better understand and prepare for AAM technology.</p>
<p>The brief letter is fuzzy on the details. The mayors request a “modest” amount of funding. The source told TechCrunch that it would likely be in the low tens of millions, with the assumption that a one-year planning study in a large metropolitan city would cost around $1 million. So the total funds would cover around 15-20 cities. The idea is that this information could inform future rule-makings or even the Federal Aviation Administration’s reauthorization bill that’s coming up in 2023.</p>
<p>One thing that’s notable about the letter is a line that starts, “When this new transportation technology launches in 2024 and beyond … ”. While 2024 has been publicly set as a launch target for eVTOL developer like Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation, timelines are a tricky thing for emerging technologies.</p>
<p>In any case, I’ll be keeping track of these developments. It’s hard to imagine Congressional Republicans agreeing to funding for AAM when they could hardly agree on electric vehicles, but we’ll see — the low tens of millions may be a blip on the budget line of such a large funding package.</p>
<p><strong>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> on June 29 <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/document/sgo-crash-reporting-adas-ads">issued an order</a> requiring OEMS and drivers of vehicles equipped with autonomous driving systems to report crashes within one day of learning about them. The order specifically relates to SAE Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems or SAE Levels 3-5 automated driving systems. Any incident that involves an injury that had to be treated at a hospital, a death, a vehicle tow-away, air bag deployment, or a pedestrian or bicyclist must be reported, the order says.</p>
<p>NHTSA says the data collected from this order will help identify safety issues or defects in the technology. “By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Min Wanli had a career path much coveted by those pursuing a career in computer science. A prodigy, Min was accepted to a top research university in China at the age of 14. He subsequently obtained Ph.D. degrees in physics and statistics from the University of Chicago before spending nearly a combined decade at IBM and Google.</p>
<p>Like many young, aspiring Chinese scientists working in the United States, Min returned to China when the country&#8217;s internet boom was underway in the early 2010s. He joined Alibaba&#8217;s fledgling cloud arm and was at the forefront of applying its tech to industrial scenarios, like using visual identification to mitigate highway traffic and computing power to improve factory efficiency.</p>
<p>Then in July 2019, Min took a leap. He resigned from Alibaba Cloud, which had become a major growth driver for the e-commerce goliath and at the time China&#8217;s largest public cloud infrastructure provider (it still is). With no experience in investment, he started a new venture capital firm called <a href="https://www.northsummitcapital.com/">North Summit Capital</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of enterprises were quite skeptical of &#8216;digital transformation&#8217; around 2016 and 2017. But by 2019, after they had seen success cases [from Alibaba Cloud], they no longer questioned its viability,&#8221; said Min in his office overlooking a cluster of urban villages and highrise offices in Shenzhen. Clad in a well-ironed light blue shirt, he talked with a childlike, earnest smile.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Suddenly, everyone wanted to go digital. But how am I supposed to meet their needs with a team of just 400-500 people?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Min&#8217;s solution was not to serve the old-school factories and corporations himself but to finance and support a raft of companies to do so. Soon he closed the first fund for North Summit with &#8220;several hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; from an undisclosed high-net-worth individual from the United Arab Emirates, whom Min had met when he represented Alibaba at a Duhai tech conference in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital is like a magnifier through which I can connect with a lot of tech companies and share my lessons from the past, so they can quickly and effectively work with their clients from traditional industries,&#8221; Min said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, I&#8217;d discuss with my portfolio firms whether they should focus on selling hardware pieces or software first, or give them equal weight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Min strives to be deeply involved in the companies he backs. North Summit invests early, with check sizes so far ranging from roughly $5 million to $25 million. Min also started a technology service company called <a href="http://www.quadtalent-intl.com/">Quadtalent</a> to provide post-investment support to his portfolio.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173512" style="width: 683px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173512" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2173512 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg" alt="" width="673" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WeChat-Image_20210702102324.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173512" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: North Summit Capital&#8217;s office in Shenzhen</p></div></p>
<p>The notion of digital transformation is both buzzy and daunting for many investors due to the highly complex and segmented nature of traditional industries. But Min has a list of criteria to help narrow down his targets.</p>
<p>First, an investable area should be data-intensive. Subway tracks, for example, could benefit from implementing large amounts of sensors that monitor the rail system&#8217;s status. Second, an area&#8217;s manufacturing or business process should be capital-intensive, such as production lines that use exorbitant equipment. And lastly, the industry should be highly dependent on repetitive human experience, like police directing traffic.</p>
<p>Solving industrial problems require not just founders&#8217; computing ingenuity but more critically, their experience in a traditional sector. As such, Min goes beyond the &#8220;Ivory Tower&#8221; of computer science wizards when he looks for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need today is a type of inter-disciplinary talent who can do &#8216;compound algorithms.&#8217; That means understanding sensor signals, business rationales, manufacturing, as well as computer algorithms. Applying neural network through an algorithmic black box without the other factors is simply futile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Min faces ample competition as investors hunt down the next ABB, Schneider, or Siemens of China. The country is driving towards technological independence in all facets of the economy and the national mandate takes on new urgency as COVID-19 disrupts global supply chains. The result is skyrocketing valuations for startups touting &#8220;industrial upgrade&#8221; solutions, Min noted.</p>
<p>But factory bosses don&#8217;t care whether their automation solution providers are underdogs or startup unicorns. &#8220;At the end of the day, the factory CFO will only ask, &#8216;how much more money does this piece of software or equipment help us save or make?'&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The investor is cautious about deploying his maiden fund. Two years into operation, North Summit has <a href="https://www.northsummitcapital.com/portfolio/">closed four deals</a>: TopScore, a 17-year-old footwear manufacturer embracing automation; Lingumi, a London-based English learning app targeting Chinese pre-school kids; Aerodyne, a Malaysian drone service provider; and Extreme Vision, a marketplace connecting small-and-medium enterprises to affordable AI vision solutions. </span></p>
<p>This year, North Summit aims to invest close to $100 million in companies inside and outside China. Optical storage and robotic process automation (RPA) are just two areas that have been on Min&#8217;s radar in recent days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce is booming in Southeast Asia, but in many markets, the fragmented logistics industry is struggling to catch up. This means sellers run into roadblocks when shipping to buyers, especially outside of major metropolitan areas, and managing their supply chains. <a href="https://golocad.com/">Locad</a>, a startup that wants to help with what it describes as an “end-to-end solution” for cross-border e-commerce companies, announced today it has raised a $4.9 million seed round.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Sequoia Capital India’s Surge (Locad is currently a part of the program’s fifth cohort), with participation from firms like Antler, Febe Ventures, Foxmont, GFC and Hustle Fund. It also included angel investors Alessandro Duri, Alexander Friedhoff, Christian Weiss, Henry Ko, Huey Lin, Markus Bruderer, Dr. Markus Erken, Max Moldenhauer, Oliver Mickler, Paulo Campos, Stefan Mader, Thibaud Lecuyer, Tim Marbach and Tim Seithe.</p>
<p>Locad was founded in Singapore and Manila by Constantin Robertz, former Zalora director of operations Jannis Dargel and Shrey Jain, previously Grab’s lead product manager of maps. It now also has offices in Australia, Hong Kong and India. The startup’s goal is to close the gap between first-mile and last-mile delivery services, enabling e-commerce companies to offer lower shipping rates and faster deliveries while freeing up more time for other parts of their operations, such as marketing and sales conversions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its founding in October 2020, Locad has been used by more than 30 brands and processed almost 600,000 items. Its clients range from startups to international brands, and include Mango, Vans, Payless Shoes, Toshiba and Landmark, a department store chain in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Locad is among a growing roster of other Southeast Asia-based logistics startups that have recently raised funding, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/kargo-raises-31-million-series-a-coronavirus-relief-fund/">Kargo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/indonesian-logistics-startup-sicepat-raises-170-million-series-b/">SiCepat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesian-supply-chain-startup-advotics-raises-2-75m-led-by-east-ventures/">Advotics</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/indonesian-logistics-platform-logisly-raises-6-million-series-a-to-digitize-truck-shipments/">Logisly</a>. Locad wants to differentiate by providing a flexible solution that can work with any sales channel and is integrated with a wide range of shipping providers.</p>

<p>Robertz told TechCrunch that Locad is able to keep an asset-light business model by partnering with warehouse operators and facility managers. What the startup brings to the mix is a cloud software platform that serves as a “control tower,” letting users get real-time information about inventory and orders across Locad’s network. The company currently has seven fulfillment centers, with four of its warehouses in the Philippines and the other three in Singapore, New South Wales, Australia and Hong Kong. Part of its funding will be used to expand into more Asia-Pacific markets, focusing on Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>Locad’s seed round will also used to add integrations to more couriers and sales channels (it can already be used with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, Shopee, Lazada and Zalora), and develop new features for its cloud platform, including more data analytics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.tinybird.co">Tinybird</a>, a new startup that helps developers build data products at scale without having to worry about infrastructure, query time and all those annoying issues that come up once you deal with huge data sets. The company ingests data at scale, lets you transform it using SQL and then exposes that data through API endpoints.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, analytics and business intelligence products have really changed the way we interact with data. Now, many big companies store data in a data warehouse or a data lake. They try to get insights from those data sets.</p>
<p>And yet, extracting and manipulating data can be costly and slow. It works great if you want to make a PowerPoint presentation for your quarterly results. But it doesn’t let you build modern web products and data products in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What we do at Tinybird is we help developers build data products at any scale. And we’re really focused on the realtime aspect,” co-founder and CEO Jorge Gómez Sancha told me.</p>
<p>The team of co-founders originally met at <a href="https://carto.com">Carto</a>. They were already working on complex data issues. “Every year people would come with an order of magnitude more data,” Gómez Sancha said. That’s how they came up with the idea behind Tinybird.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173302" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173302" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png" alt="" width="1024" height="605" class="size-full wp-image-2173302" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png 1774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=1536,907 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PR-Asset.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinybird</p></div></p>
<p>The product can be divided into three parts. First, you connect your Tinybird account with your data sources. The company will then ingest data constantly from those data sources.</p>
<p>Second, you can transform that data through SQL queries. In addition to the command-line interface, you can also enter your SQL queries in a web interface, divide then into multiple steps and document everything. Every time you write a query, you can see your data filtered and sorted according to your query.</p>
<p>Third, you can create API endpoints based on those queries. After that, it works like a standard JSON-based API. You can use it to fetch data in your own application.</p>
<p>What makes Tinybird special is that it’s so fast that it feels like you’re querying your data in realtime. &quot;Several of our customers are reading over 1.5 trillion rows on average per day via Tinybird and ingesting around 5 billion rows per day, others are making an average of 250 requests per second to our APIs querying several billion row datasets,&quot; Gómez Sancha wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Behind the scene, the startup uses <a href="https://clickhouse.tech">ClickHouse</a>. But you don’t have to worry about that as Tinybird manages all the infrastructure for you.</p>
<p>Right now, Tinybird has identified three promising use cases. Customers can use it to provide in-product analytics. For instance, if you operate a web hosting service and wants to give some analytics to your customers or if you manage online stores and want to surface purchasing data to your customers, Tinybird works well for that.</p>
<p>Some customers also use the product for operational intelligence, such as realtime dashboards that you can share internally within a company. Your teams can react more quickly and always know if everything is running fine.</p>
<p>You can also use Tinybird as the basis for some automation or complex event processing. For instance, you can leverage Tinybird to build a web application firewall that scans your traffic and reacts in realtime.</p>
<p>Tinybird has raised a $3 million seed round led by Crane.vc with several business angels also participating, such as Nat Friedman (GitHub CEO), Nicholas Dessaigne (Algolia co-founder), Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO), Jason Warner (GitHub CTO), Adam Gross (former Heroku CEO), Stijn Christiaens (co-founder and CTO of Collibra), Matias Woloski (co-founder and CTO of Auth0) and Carsten Thoma (Hybris co-founder).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been no action in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raising investments, startups in MENA continue to garner interest, mainly in B2B e-commerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the latest of these is coming out of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.maxab.io/">MaxAB</a>, a startup based out of Cairo that serves a network of traditional food and grocery retailers across Egypt, has raised $40 million in Series A financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which claims to have launched in a new city every month this year, will be expanding its physical footprint across the Middle East and North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MaxAB plans on hiring more talent and scaling its recently launched business verticals, including new supply chains and embedded finance solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in November 2018 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/belal-el-megharbel-34718023">Belal El-Megharbel</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ben-halim-46072511a">Mohamed Ben Halim</a>, MaxAB&#8217;s platform manages procurement and grocery delivery to shops in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Store owners can use the platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods, request delivery or logistics to move the goods, and access a customer support team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology platform; we operate our own warehouses, we operate our own fleet. And the idea was quite simple.&#8221;  CEO El-Megharbel said to TechCrunch. According to him, small merchants in Egypt, representing a large chunk of the nation&#8217;s GDP, find it hard to procure their inventory. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, manufacturers also have to suffer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immensely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and incur so many costs to serve a market like Egypt, where over 400,000 small mom-and-pop shops sell 90% of groceries in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw that there is a massive role in optimizing this supply chain using technology so that we can have the right amount of products at the right place at the right time,&#8221; explained El-Megharbel, the chief executive who left Careem in 2018 to start MaxAB</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He calls MaxAB the Amazon for retail in the Middle East. There&#8217;s a slight comparison. In emerging markets, it can be challenging to find third-party e-commerce delivery companies to work with. Those available are either expensive or inefficient. This is why MaxAB has its own infrastructure. The company doesn&#8217;t build warehouses from scratch. Instead, it buys them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outrightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and revamps them to fit its needs. After that, MaxAB uses internal technology tools to better manage inventory flow in, within, and out of the warehouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Megharbel noted that up until last year, MaxAB </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on offering a single type of supply chain in one city. That was before and after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/maxab-raises-6m-seed-round-to-optimize-egypts-b2b-grocery-markets/">completing its $6.2 million seed round</a> with 9,000 merchants on its app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with this new round, MaxAB solidifies both infrastructure and technology into a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chain and multi-city business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new development is accompanying a period of growth the company experienced in the last two years where it now services more than 55,000 merchants and delivers over 2,000 unique products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staff size, the company has grown more than 5x to 1,600 people and is looking to add to that number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the embedded finance solutions, the plan for MaxAB is to offer financial services to its merchants. First of all, given the company&#8217;s database of merchants, MaxAB can predict their financial status. Then orking with banking and non-banking partners, MaxAB will offer credit facilities and capital financing to these merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB&#8217;s Series A investment is one of the largest in this financing round across the MENA region. Impact investor <a href="https://www.rmbv.net/">RMBV</a> led the round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from the</span><a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/Topics_Ext_Content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Venture+Capital"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://flourishventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="http://crystalstreamcap.cn/en"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Crystal Stream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="http://www.risecapital.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rise Capital,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://endeavor.org/catalyst/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavour Catalyst.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Exiting investors,</span><a href="https://becocapital.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beco Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.4dxventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also took part. This round brings the company’s total investment to date to $46.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique structure of Egypt’s economy, with hundreds of thousands of shopkeepers and small businesses becoming the lifeline of our country at the time of crisis,” said managing partner at RMBV Ahmed Badreldin in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be backing visionary entrepreneurs that have created a transformative business with impressive growth that is a catalyst for financial inclusion and job creation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We look forward to supporting MaxAB in its next phase of development as they continue delivering on growth and innovation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased technology adoption and enhanced the company&#8217;s unit economics. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a market leader, MaxAB has taken advantage to consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its position and scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amidst competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is competitiveness in the Middle East. Most of them are marketplace models but do not manage their supply chain per se. And this is what makes our model more unique is that we own the end-to-end cycle. It&#8217;s painful, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this is what this industry, the food and groceries B2B e-commerce space, needs,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After expanding across MENA, does the company see any opportunity southward into sub-Saharan Africa where it might face competition from the likes of Sokowatch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the near future,&#8221; answered El-Megharbel. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this market [the Middle East and North Africa] is almost $200 billion per year. So we have a long way to go there before we go to sub-Saharan Africa.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Furlenco, a Bangalore-based startup that operates an eponymous furniture and appliance rental service, said today it has raised $140 million in a financing round as it looks to scale its operations in the South Asian market and explore international market expansion.</p>
<p>The new $140 million financing round, a Series D, comprises $120 million debt raise and rest in equity, the seven-year-old Indian startup told TechCrunch. The new financing round was led by Zinnia Global Fund. CE-Ventures and Lightbox Ventures also participated in this round, which brings its to-date debt and equity raise to over $240 million, according to data insight platform Tracxn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.furlenco.com">Furlenco</a>, which operates in more than a dozen Indian cities, allows customers to rent a range of furniture items. In recent quarters, it has expanded to other categories including fitness equipments, appliances, electronic products, as well as two-wheeler vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173494 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/furlenco-website.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A queen size bed on the platform, for instance, starts at as low as $9 a month, while a laptop can be rented for as low as a monthly plan of $40. The startup has attracted customers in part because of its three-day delivery commitment, and deep cleaning of items at no additional cost. It also maintains a partnership with NoBroker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/indias-nobroker-raises-an-additional-30m-from-general-atlantic/">a General Atlantic-backed Indian startup</a> that helps customers avoid brokers when finding new apartments.</p>
<p>The expansion into newer categories helped the startup recover and preserve 95% of its revenue in the financial year that ended in March this year, it said. Lightbox Ventures said Furlenco may explore expansion into Middle East and other international markets.</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with Rentomojo, said it will deploy the fresh capital to fuel its growth and also invest in design and also work to generate an annual revenue of $300 million in the next five years.</p>
<p>“Lifestyles have evolved and so have the needs of the urban Indian when it comes to how they do up their home. However, the furniture industry has some catching up to do in providing the right kind of solutions. We know there is immense strength and scope of innovation in the B2C commerce space and the sectors we operate in. We are tapping into that potential and will definitely disrupt the market with what we are planning,” said Ajith Mohan Karimpana, founder and chief executive of Furlenco, in a statement.</p>
<p>Rent platforms, like many others, saw a major dip last year when the coronavirus hit the country. But the market it&#8217;s going after remains a big opportunity. According to industry estimates, the rental furniture and appliance industry is currently worth over $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Furlenco, which is rapidly transforming Furniture subscription services for India&#8217;s lifestyle aspirants. As an industry leader with a strong management team, Furlenco is poised for continued strong growth,” said Ritesh Abbi, Zinnia Global Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has ordered app-store operators to remove the app of Didi from their stores, the latest as tension escalates between the nation’s largest ride-hailing giant and local regulators. The app has disappeared from several stores including Apple’s App Store in China, TechCrunch can confirm.</p>
<p>The nation’s cyberspace administration, which unveiled the order on Sunday, said Didi was illegally collecting users’ personal data.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing giant, which counts Apple, SoftBank, and Tencent and Uber among its investors and filed for an IPO late last month, has been ordered to make changes to comply with Chinese data protection rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move comes after the Chinese internet watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">announced a probe into Didi over “national security” concerns</a> earlier this week. Didi raised at least $4 billion this week after the New York Stock Exchange debut in one of the largest U.S. IPOs.</p>
<p>In a statement, Didi said it had removed its app from various app stores and begun the “corrections.” It also said it had halted new user registrations on Saturday. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For existing users, the Didi app remains operational.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very rare for an app of this scale to be pulled from the app stores. For the 12 months ended March, Didi served 493 million annual active users and saw 41 million transactions on a daily basis, it revealed recently.</p>
<p>The app had 156 million monthly users in Q1, well above Uber’s 98 million in the period.China’s official data showed the country had 365 million ride-hailing users as of December, which suggests Didi commands a substantial market share.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3><strong>Android App Bundles are now going to be required</strong></h3>
<p>This week Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html">announced</a> it will require new apps to be published using the Android App Bundle as of August 2021. The company first launched the Android App Bundle standard, which replaces the APK, in May 2018 as part of its modern development push. Since then, the majority of the top 1,000 apps and games have switched over to AABs including those from companies like Adobe, Duolingo. Gameloft, Netflix, reBus, Rainy, and Twitter. Today, there are over 1 million apps using AAB in production.</p>
<p>AABs solve some problems with the aging APK standard, particularly around larger apps and games. With AABs, developers don&#8217;t have to create an APK that contains everything for every type of Android device. They offer a way to quickly and more efficiently download the assets needed for a particular device, and they do so in a way that focuses on getting the user or player to the app or game&#8217;s content as fast as possible.</p>
<p>But not everyone agrees the change is for the better. Those who utilize APK Hosting sites like APKMirror or APKPure to download and share apps worry that the shift to AAB is a way to force users to use the Play Store instead of alternatives. Meanwhile, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney &#8212; who is taking on tech giants over their alleged app store monopolies with both lawsuits and lobbying &#8212; pointed out that the move away from the more open APK standard is about locking users into Google Play.</p>

<h3>Consumer Spending on apps hits record $64.9B in the first half of the year</h3>
<p>Consumer spending in mobile apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/consumer-spending-on-apps-hit-record-64-9b-in-first-half-of-2021-but-install-growth-slowed-to-1-7/">hit a record </a>$64.9 billion during the first half of 2021, according to preliminary data from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This figure represents a 24.8% increase in spending seen across both the App Store and Google Play, compared with the year-ago period. But while industry experts believe the accelerated shift to mobile fueled by the pandemic is a trend that will continue, it’s worth noting that — despite the new record — the growth rate for consumer spending has slightly slowed, and the download growth slowed more dramatically.</p>
<p>From the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020, consumer spending on mobile apps grew 28.4% from $40.5 billion to $52 billion, for comparison — slower than the 24.8% seen in the current period.</p>

<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Apple launched the public betas of iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/with-watchos-8-apple-wants-to-help-you-chill-the-hell-1847195000?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">watchOS 8</a></strong>. Although developers already had access to early builds, this week was the first time the public could get their hands on Apple&#8217;s latest software before its official launch this fall. One of the biggest changes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/">iOS 15</a> is the addition of &#8220;Focus&#8221; modes that give users more control over when and who can bother them with calls, texts and notifications during different contexts &#8212; like work, driving, sleeping, and more. Users will also gain access to SharePlay interactivity on FaceTime, iMessage improvements, the ability to FaceTime with Android friends via web links, spatial audio, Live Text (which unlocks info from your photos), app privacy reports, and upgrades to most of Apple&#8217;s core apps, and more.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Google is implementing stronger security measures on Google Play developer accounts in an attempt to crack down on spam and other malicious apps. </strong>Previously, the company required only an email and phone number to create a Google Play developer account. Now it <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/play-dev-id-requirements-2-step.html">will require</a> an account type (personal or organization), a contact name and physical address, and it will require developers to verify their email and phone number. Google says the changes will allow it to better communicate with developers and will help to &#8220;make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details.&#8221; It&#8217;s also now mandating that users of Google Play Console sign in using Google’s 2-Step Verification.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/samsung-and-google-detail-wearable-platform-ahead-of-next-galaxy-watch-launc">previewed</a> their wearable platform ahead of the next Galaxy Watch launch.</strong> The two companies agreed to partner on wearables in order to better compete against Apple Watch. At Mobile World Congress, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/">Samsung showed off</a> the first device to feature the One UI Watch user experience and the new unified platform built in partnership with Google.</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/amplifying-black-owned-businesses-on-instagram/">adds a new feature</a> that will allow businesses in the U.S. to designate themselves as being Black-owned businesses</strong> using badges that appear on their profiles and on their product shopping pages. It may also be highlighted in places like the Shop tab, to help more potential customers discover the business.</p>
<p><strong>Walmart <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/walmart-ibotta-digital-deal-loyalty-program-rebates/2347221">partnered</a> with mobile couponing app Ibotta on a multi-year deal that will offer cash-back rewards to Walmart customers</strong> that will be applied directly to customers&#8217; Walmart accounts, where they can be used for future purchases. The offers will be made available on Walmart.com and inside the Walmart mobile app.</p>
<p><strong>Following Apple and Google&#8217;s lead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shopify-drops-its-app-store-commissions-to-0-on-developers-first-million-in-revenue">Shopify dropped App Store commissions</a></strong>. However, it&#8217;s dropping its cut to 0% for the first million, and then will only take a 15% commission on &#8220;marginal&#8221; revenue above that $1 million. The change could increase pressure on other app stores to make further adjustments to their models in the future.</p>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<p><strong>Rakuten <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/viber-lenses-powered-by-snap-debut/">Viber has partnered with Snap</a> to bring augmented reality Lenses from Snapchat to its own Viber calling and messaging app</strong>. The over 30 Lenses will be built using Snap&#8217;s creative tools, including Bitmoji, Camera Kit, and Creative Kit and will offer AR-enabled messaging and photos to Viber&#8217;s users. The deal is another example of how Snap is growing its licensing business for its AR and creative tools alongside the development of its own social app.</p>
<p><strong>Google&#8217;s Arts &amp; Culture app <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/bringing-artworks-to-life-with-ar.html">created</a> a new feature called Art Filter that allows everyone to learn about significant pieces of art from around the world and put themselves inside famous paintings</strong> using AR. Google talked this week about its work with MediaPipe to utilize their face mesh and 3D face transform tech to create custom effects for each of the artifacts chosen.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>Venmo introduced a new feature that allows users to add a &#8220;good and services&#8221; tag to payments sent to personal accounts to differentiate them from personal transactions.</strong> The system is meant to protect buyers and sellers, Venmo says. Buyers on these transactions will be eligible for Venmo&#8217;s Purchase Protection Program, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/28/22554305/venmo-small-businesses-toggle-paypal-account-fees-transactions">sellers are unable with the new fees</a> associated with the change as Venmo will now deduct 1.9% of the transaction plus 10 cents from the money sent to the seller.</p>
<p><strong>Intuit-owned finance and budgeting app Mint <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/mint-app-now-lets-you-track-crypto-investments/">added the ability</a> to track cryptocurrency investments across a number of supported exchanges,</strong> including Binance, BlockFi, Coinbase/Coinbase Pro, Gemini, Kraken, PayPal, and Robinhood. As a result, the app shot to No. 12 overall on the U.S. App Store on Wednesday and became the No. 1 app in the Finance category, though it has since dropped in ranking.</p>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>TikTok is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds">expanding its max video length</a> to 3 minutes, up from 60 seconds</strong>, after testing this feature publicly for many months with a select group of creators. The feature will allow for more long-form video content, potentially making TikTok even more of a threat to YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss/">bans weight loss ads</a> on its platform, becoming the first major social platform to take this sort of action</strong>. The company says social media plays a role in promoting harmful beauty standards, and ads that glorify weight loss contribute to a rise in disordered eating behaviors rather than healthy habits.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/">is developing its own version</a> of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follow with &#8220;Exclusive Stories.</strong>&#8221; Instagram confirmed that the screenshots of an &#8220;Exclusive Stories&#8221; feature recently circulated across social media are from an internal prototype that’s now in development, but not yet being publicly tested. The feature would allow creators to offer Stories that only members (likely paying subscribers) would be able to see. These would appear on their profile in different colors and would display a message that their Story was only for members when others tried to view them. They could also be saved as Highlights, and can&#8217;t be screenshot, according to the leaks.</p>

<p><strong>TikTok&#8217;s latest <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-q-1-2021-community-guidelines-enforcement-report">transparency report</a> revealed the company removed 11,149,514 accounts in Q1 2021 for violating community guidelines or terms of service</strong>, which is fewer than 1% of total accounts. Of those removals, 7,263,952 were accounts belonging to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>Trump and Parler reportedly discussed a deal that would move the bulk of Trump&#8217;s social media presence to the right-wing Twitter alternative</strong>, according to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/michael-wolff-landslide-final-days-trump-presidency-excerpt.html">New York Magazine</a>. The deal would have seen Trump taking 40% of Parler&#8217;s revenues had it gone through. Parler was okay with the rev share, but wouldn&#8217;t ban Trump&#8217;s critics from the app, which scuttled the deal, the report said.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up">is testing a feature</a> that would allow anyone to be able to share a link directly in their Stories through a linking sticker,</strong> which would work the same way the swipe-up links currently do. The company said the test is looking to understand how many people would use links, if available.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter offered users a chance to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently">receive one of seven free NFTs</a> this week,</strong> which were minted on Rarible in editions of 20, making for 140 NFTs (get it?) in total. The NFTs were offered to those who replied to a post from the company&#8217;s main Twitter account, and could signal Twitter&#8217;s plans to invest in making NFTs more a part of its platform in the future.</p>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T joined T-Mobile in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages">switching its customers </a>to use the Android Messages app as their default mobile messages app for both SMS and RCS services</strong>, making Verizon the only U.S. carrier that has not made a partnership deal with Google. RCS has a lot of advantages over SMS, including no character limits, the ability to send larger files, typing indicators, better group chat, Wi-Fi support and end-to-end encryption for one-on-one group chats. This makes it a more compelling alternative to Apple&#8217;s iMessage, but it requires carrier adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Audio chat comes to the workplace as Slack this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">released a new audio tool called Slack Huddles</a> that allows users to have real-time conversations with colleagues in Slack&#8217;s app instead of typing</strong>. The company also offered more details about an upcoming feature that allows users to leave video messages and it showed off an upgraded employee directory. The video messages tool is being piloted while the directory is currently available to a limited number of Business + and Enterprise Grid customers.</p>
<p><strong>The U.K. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">issued guidance</a> to messaging apps operating in the country to not use end-to-end encryption on children&#8217;s accounts, asking companies to consider the risks that e2e poses to younger users</strong>, as it makes it more difficult to identify illegal and harmful content that takes place on private channels. A government spokesperson stressed that there&#8217;s a way to implement strong encryption in a way that&#8217;s consistent with public safety. Privacy activists disagree with this stance.</p>

<p><strong>WhatsApp is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/27/whatsapp-ios-voice-message-feature/">testing a redesigned voice message feature</a> that will show short waveforms when the user is recording the message.</strong> After recording, the user can stop and listen to their message before sending it, too.</p>
<h3>Dating</h3>
<p><strong>Dating app Bumble is <a href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/dating-app-bumble-will-open-its-first-cafe-new-york-july/2347286">planning to open its first cafe in New York</a> later this month. The launch was originally planned for 2019, but was delayed due to the pandemic</strong>. The new venue, Bumble Brew, is being enabled by a partnership between the dating app maker and Italian restaurant <a href="https://www.pasqualejones.com/">Pasquale Jones</a>. Decked out in Bumble&#8217;s yellow, the new cafe will open next to the restaurant, to offer a place for daters to meet for either coffee, cocktails or a meal.</p>
<h3>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<p><strong>Netflix users on Android devices will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22551099/netflix-partial-download-feature">now be able to start streaming</a> titles that have only partially downloaded</strong>, which could help in the scenario where you&#8217;ve forgotten to download your favorite shows before boarding a plane. Before, until the download completed, you couldn&#8217;t watch any portion of the video at all.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese TikTok rival Kuaishou and Tencent <a href="https://variety.com/2021/sports/news/kuaishou-tokyo-beijing-olympics-rights-1235007730/">acquired the short-form rights</a> to the upcoming Tokyo and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics from state broadcaster CCTV</strong>. This makes the app the first short-form and livestreaming platform globally to become an official broadcaster of the Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Music Unlimited is <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-music-unlimited-subscribers-get-up-to-6-months-of-disney-for-free/">giving subscribers</a> up to six months of Disney+ for free</strong> (or three for existing subscribers). Disney&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the first to bundle a streaming deal with music. Hulu and Spotify had once done the same.</p>
<p><strong>Spotify <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/news-and-insights/spotify-audience-network-global-launch/?">launched</a> its Spotify Audience Network ad marketplace to advertisers and Megaphone publishers in Australia, Canada and the U.K., following its U.S. launch in February</strong>.

South Korea is seeing an even better recovery, as time spent in travel apps has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

<p><strong>The new <a href="https://brickit.app/">Brickit</a> mobile app is a Lego fan&#8217;s dream and an impressive use of computer vision technology</strong>. The app is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/lego-should-snap-up-this-rapid-fire-brick-finding-ios-app/">able to quickly analyze a pile of Legos</a> to identify which bricks you have in your collection. It then serves up some projects where you have all, or at least most of, the bricks you need to build. The process is very fast, too &#8212; the app makes sense of hundreds of bricks in your pile within just seconds. Brickit doesn&#8217;t come from Lego directly, however, which limits some of its capabilities in terms of integrating with Lego&#8217;s larger library of instructions. But, in time, it will likely generate some data on the Lego collections users have at home which could make it an interesting acquisition target for Lego, in addition to the tech itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wow, that headline worked?</p>
<p>A recent board fight at a digital health unicorn is a reminder to entrepreneurs that it’s important to set boundaries, even amid the dizzying volume and velocity of <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter/status/1410217094734663686">this summer’s deal frenzy</a>.</p>
<p>This week I published a scoop about how<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/"> Bessemer Venture Partners replaced a board member at Hinge Health</a>, after that board member invested in a competing startup. Hinge Health co-founder Daniel Perez alleges that the board member did not notify him before they led a round in an early-stage startup in the same sector.</p>
<p>The situation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/bessemer-replaces-board-member-at-hinge-health-following-competitive-tensions/">gives a rare and nuanced peek</a> into the world of competitive tension between startups. While founders expect certain standards of conduct from investors, including that they notify them of investments in directly competitive startups, investors may be feeling more pressure to make faster decisions that clash with the founders they’ve already backed, while having different definitions of competition from their portfolios. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/in-a-post-nda-world-does-transparency-help-founders-identify-conflicts-of-interest/">In a post-NDA world</a>, the rules need to be rewritten around how to have these conversations.</p>
<p>I’m not quite sure if more due diligence is the solution to everyone’s woes — but I do think transparency and explicitness between founders and investors can’t hurt. It’s not just for founders. Investors, who owe returns to their LPs, don’t want to be in situations where they can’t invest in a booming sector because they have one other investment in the sector.</p>
<p>The situations are endless:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when a startup pivots into a different market than the one that it sold its investors on and is suddenly competitive with a portfolio company?</li>
<li>What if a portfolio company’s future roadmap includes a go-to-market strategy that clashes with a potential investment?</li>
<li>Can a Sequoia India partner back a company that is directly competing with a Sequoia India company?</li>
<li>Is it okay for there to be competing investments within the same firm as long as different partners are sitting on the board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on my DMs, Hinge Health isn’t alone in dealing with current investors backing competitors. It adds an asterisk to the barrage of funding rounds. Welcome to hot due diligence summer, I guess?</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into the Duolingo S-1, a creator economy rebrand and an exclusive interview with top startup marketers. As always, you can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> — send me tips<em> or </em>notes on any competitive tensions you’ve dealt with.</p>

The document also exposed a number of other fun factoids, such as the fact that only four people left the company in 2020 — and that Duolingo is indeed looking to scoop up some companies.</p>

<p>On Equity this week, Alex and I brought on techie comedian Alexis Gay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dear-economy-creators-arent-fragile-plants/?tpcc=ECTW2020">to talk about the creator economy. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Gay went from helping creators via her role at Patreon to becoming a creative herself. We talked about pet peeves, why it’s important to be explicit when building tools for this economy, and if rolling funds are inevitable for anyone with a Twitter following. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dear-economy-creators-arent-fragile-plants/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Check out the episode</a>, which I’d say is one of our funniest to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, researchers have mapped all the known targets, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/citizen-lab-iphone-nso-group/">journalists, activists, and human rights defenders</a>, whose phones were hacked by Pegasus, a spyware developed by NSO Group.</p>
<p>Forensic Architecture, an academic unit at Goldsmiths, University of London that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/forensic-architecture-redeploys-surveillance-state-tech-to-combat-state-sponsored-violence/">investigates human rights abuses</a>, scoured dozens of reports from human rights groups, carried out open-source research and interviewed dozens of the victims themselves to reveal over a thousand data points, including device infections, which show relations and patterns between digital surveillance carried out by NSO&#8217;s government customers, and the real-world intimidation, harassment and violence that the victims are also subject to.</p>
<p>By mapping out these data points <a href="https://www.digitalviolence.org/#/platform">on a bespoke platform</a>, the researchers can show how nation-states, which use Pegasus to spy on their victims, also often target other victims in their networks and are entangled with assaults, arrests, and disinformation campaigns against the targets but also their families, friends, and colleagues.</p>
<p>Although the thousand-plus data points only present a portion of the overall use of Pegasus by governments, the project aims to provide researchers and investigators the tools and data of NSO&#8217;s activities worldwide, which the spyware maker goes to great lengths to keep out of the public eye.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>Pegasus &#8220;activates your camera, your microphone, all that which forms an integral part of your life.&#8221; <cite>Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Israel-based NSO Group develops Pegasus, a spyware that allows its government customers near-unfettered access to a victim&#8217;s device, including their personal data and their location. NSO has repeatedly declined to name its customers but reportedly has government contracts in at least 45 countries, said to include Rwanda, Israel, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates — all of which have been accused of human rights abuses — as well as Western nations, like Spain.</p>
<p>Forensic Architecture&#8217;s researcher-in-charge Shourideh Molavi said the new findings reveal &#8220;the extent to which the digital domain we inhabit has become the new frontier of human rights violations, a site of state surveillance and intimidation that enables physical violations in real space.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform presents visual timelines of how victims are targeted by both spyware and physical violence as part of government campaigns to target their most outspoken critics.</p>
<p>Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi video blogger and activist living in exile in Montreal, had his phone hacked in 2018 by the Pegasus malware. Shortly after Saudi emissaries tried to convince Abdulaziz to return  to the kingdom, his phone was hacked. Weeks later, two of his brothers in Saudi Arabia were arrested and his friends detained.</p>
<p>Abdulaziz, a confidant of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html">murder was approved</a> by Saudi&#8217;s <em>de facto </em>ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also had information about his Twitter account obtained by a &#8220;state-sponsored&#8221; actor, which later transpired to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/twitter-employee-saudi-state-sponsored-hacking-warning/">a Saudi spy employed by Twitter</a>. It was this stolen data, which included Abdulaziz&#8217;s phone number, that helped the Saudis penetrate his phone and read his messages with Khashoggi in real-time, Yahoo News <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/a-direct-trail-of-blood-drops-leads-from-a-twitter-hack-to-jamal-khashoggis-murder-090051087.html">reported</a> this week.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173403" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173403" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2173403 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="580" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=1536,870 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=2048,1161 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/omar-abdulaziz.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173403" class="wp-caption-text">Omar Abdulaziz is one of dozens of known victims of digital surveillance by a nation state. Blue dots represent digital intrusions and red dots indicate physical events, such as harassment or violence. (Image: Forensic Architecture/supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui is another known victim, whose phone was hacked several times over 2015 and 2016 by a government customer of Pegasus, likely Mexico. The University of Toronto&#8217;s Citizen Lab found that her son, Emilio, a minor at the time, also <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2017/06/reckless-exploit-mexico-nso/">had his phone targeted</a> while he lived in the United States. The timeline of the digital intrusions against Aristegui, her son, and her colleagues show that the hacking efforts intensified following their exposure of corruption by Mexico&#8217;s then-president Enrique Peña Nieto.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a malware that activates your camera, your microphone, all that which forms an integral part of your life,&#8221; said Aristegui in an interview with journalist and filmmaker Laura Poitras, who contributed to the project. Speaking of her son whose phone was targeted, Aristegui said: &#8220;To know that a kid who is simply going about his life, and going to school tells us about the kinds of abuse that a state can exert without counterweight.&#8221; (NSO has repeatedly claimed it does not target phones in the United States, but offers a similar technology to Pegasus, dubbed Phantom, through U.S.-based subsidiary, Westbridge Technologies.)</p>
<p>&#8220;A phenomenal damage is caused to the journalistic responsibility when the state — or whoever — uses these systems of &#8216;digital violence&#8217;,&#8221; said Aristegui. &#8220;It ends up being a very damaging element for journalists, which affects the right of a society to keep itself informed.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173404" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173404" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2173404 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/carmen-aristegui.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173404" class="wp-caption-text">The timeline also shows the digital targeting (in blue) of Carmen Aristegui, her family, and her colleagues, entangled with break-ins at their office, intimidation, and disinformation campaigns (in red). (Image: Forensic Architecture/supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>The platform also draws on recent findings from an Amnesty International investigation into NSO Group&#8217;s corporate structure, which shows how NSO&#8217;s spyware has proliferated to states and governments using a complex network of companies to hide its customers and activities. Forensic Architecture&#8217;s platform follows the trail of private investment since NSO&#8217;s founding in 2015, which &#8220;likely enabled&#8221; the sale of the spyware to governments that NSO would not ordinarily have access to because of Israeli export restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware needs to be thought of and treated as a weapon developed, like other products of Israel’s military industrial complex, in the context of the ongoing Israeli occupation. It is disheartening to see it exported to enable human rights violations worldwide,&#8221; said Eyal Weizman, director of Forensic Architecture.</p>
<p>The platform launched shortly after NSO published its first so-called transparency report this week, which human rights defenders and security researchers panned as devoid of any meaningful detail. Amnesty International said the report reads &#8220;more like a sales brochure.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, NSO Group said it cannot comment on research it has not seen, but claimed it &#8220;investigates all credible claims of misuse, and NSO takes appropriate action based on the results of its investigations.&#8221;</p>
<p>NSO Group maintained that its technology &#8220;cannot be used to conduct cybersurveillance within the United States, and no customer has ever been granted technology that would enable them to access phones with U.S. numbers,&#8221; and declined to name any of its government customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday?

<p>Hey! It’s going to be a long weekend here in the United States, which means that this newsletter is in between myself and being done with work. So, we’re going to hit on even more topics than usual as I am a glutton for both punishment and writing. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Up first:<strong> Startups and culture.</strong></p>
<p>Something that I very much enjoyed this week was the Robinhood IPO filing. You can read our first look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-files-to-go-public-after-squeaking-to-profitability-in-2020/">here</a>, and a deeper dig into the numbers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">here</a>. But today we’re going to riff on culture. Observe the following excerpts, the first from the company’s notes on its goals via <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_910">its S-1 filing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over time, we strive to make Robinhood the most trusted, lowest cost, and most culturally relevant money app worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprised that &#8220;culturally relevant<em>&#8220;</em> made it into the mix? Then check this out, from the prospectus’s overview section (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cultural Impact. </strong>We pioneered commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which the rest of the industry emulated, and <strong>we have continued to build relationships with our customers</strong> by introducing new products that further expand access to the financial system. <strong>We believe we have made investing culturally relevant and understandable</strong>, and that our platform is enabling our customers to become long-term investors and take greater control of their finances. <strong>Over half of 18-44 year olds in the United States know who Robinhood</strong> is according to an internal brand study that we conducted in March 2021. As a further sign of our relevance today, Robinhood reached the number-one spot on the Apple App Store multiple times in the first quarter of 2021 and was frequently ranked number one in the Finance category on the Apple App store during 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.</p></blockquote>
<p>The app store bragging is whatever. The focus on <em>culture</em> caught me up.</p>
<p>I’ve often enjoyed watching culture evolve more and more rapidly over time; TikTok further accelerated the trend. And amongst the youths of the world, I’d hazard, the line between brand and culture is blurring as brands work to move more and more into cultural territory. The Robinhood S-1 is forward-looking in a number of ways, but to see a company going public discuss culture in this manner feels like the future.</p>
<p>Up second: <strong>American manufacturing is not dead.</strong></p>
<p>That’s what The Exchange learned this week from a conversation with the CEO of Xometry. The company recently went public. You can read more of our notes on its numbers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/">here</a>, but like Robinhood the former startup raised lots of venture capital and this fits into our broader remit.</p>
<p>What doesn’t, really, is what we learned about manufacturing thanks to the chat. Per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/randy_alt">Randy Altschuler</a>, his business of connecting companies in need of manufacturing with those able to build stuff is nearly an entirely U.S.-based business. That’s to say that, yes, there is still stuff made here in America.</p>
<p>What Xometry does is actually pretty cool &#8212; including offering financial services as part of its role as marketplace middleperson &#8212; but what got us the most hype was the idea that a digital service was going to help connect folks in need with folks with tools here in the United States. If Xometry’s vision of the future works out, it could help sustain, and dare we say grow, domestic manufacturing in this nation. Who would have thought that that was possible?</p>
<p>Xometry’s IPO was also a huge success, we should add. It priced above range, and then shot higher. That’s what you want as a company.</p>
<p>And third, <strong>some fun odds and ends:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More tech money in F1: </strong>Every race weekend in the Formula 1 calendar helps me notice yet another tech company putting money into racing’s most bonkers series. Zoom has a lot of branding out there, for example. And this week we <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/formula-1-strikes-100-million-cryptocurrency-sponsorship.html">got news</a> that Crypto.com has closed a five-year, $100-million deal with the racing league. That’s a lot of duckets. Notably Tezos already sponsors some teams, and you can spy both Amazon and Microsoft branding here and there in the series. Oh, and <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/2021/mclaren-shadow-project/mclaren-racing-expands-splunk-partnership/">the Splunk-McLaren tie-up was just extended</a>. New life goal: Make lots of money, sponsor F1 team, get paddock access. What could possibly go wrong?</li>
<li><strong>Unqork</strong> has hired a CRO. Not a CFO, so we can’t make <em>too</em> many IPO noises concerning the no-code service that helps big companies build apps. But <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unqork-chief-revenue-officer-philip-lacor-nocode-compete-legacy-software-2021-6">the news</a> still matters for you no-code fans.</li>
<li>Finally, Apptopia has <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/top-downloaded-digital-banking-apps-us-h12021">download numbers</a> for neobanks. Can you guess which was number one?</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until children reach a certain age, enrichment programs are somewhat limited to school, sports, and camps, while money-making opportunities are largely non-existent.</p>
<p>Now, a year-old, L.A.-based startup called <a href="https://mighty.business/">Mighty</a>, a kind of Shopify that invites younger kids to open a store online, aims to partly fill the void. In fact, Mighty &#8212; led by founders Ben Goldhirsh, who previously founded GOOD magazine, and Dana Mauriello, who spent nearly five years with Etsy and was most recently an advisor to Sidewalk Labs &#8212; hopes to woo families with the pitch that it operates at the center of fintech, ed tech, and entertainment.</p>
<p>As often happens, the concept derived from the founders&#8217; own experience. In this case, Goldhirsh, who has been living in Costa Rica, began worrying about his two daughters, who attend a small, six-person school. Because he feared they might fall behind their stateside peers, he began tutoring them when they arrived home, using Khan Academy among other software platforms. Yet the girls&#8217; reaction wasn&#8217;t exactly positive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were like, &#8220;F*ck you, dad. We just finished school and now you&#8217;re going to make us do more school?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, he encouraged them to sell online the bracelets they&#8217;d been making, figuring it would teach them needed math skills, as well as teach them about startup capital, business plans (he made them write one), and marketing. It worked, he says, and as he told friends about this successful &#8220;project-based learning effort,&#8221; they began to ask if he could help <em>their</em> kids get up and running.</p>
<p>Fast forward and Goldhirsh and Mauriello &#8212; who ran a crowdfunding platform that Goldhirsh invested in before she joined Etsy &#8212; say they&#8217;re now steering a still-in-beta startup that has become home to 3,000 &#8220;CEOs&#8221; as Mighty calls them.</p>
<p>The interest isn&#8217;t surprising. Kids are spending more of their time online than at any point in history. Many of the real-world type businesses that might have once employed young kids are shrinking in size. Aside from babysitting or selling cookies on the corner, it&#8217;s also challenging to find a job before high school, given the Department of Labor’s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, which sets 14 years old as the minimum age for employment. (Even then, many employers worry that their young employees might be more work than is worth it.)</p>
<p>Investor think it&#8217;s a pretty solid idea, too. Mighty recently closed on $6.5 million in seed funding led by Animo Ventures, with participation from Maveron, Humbition, Sesame Workshop, Collaborative Fund and NaHCO3, a family office.</p>
<p>Still, building out a platform for kids is tricky. For starters, not a lot of 11-year-olds have the tenacity required to sustain their own business over time. While Goldhirsh likens the business to a &#8220;21st century lemonade stand,&#8221; running a business that doesn&#8217;t dissolve at the end of the afternoon is a very different proposition.</p>
<p>Goldhirsh acknowledges that no kid wants to hear they have to &#8220;grind&#8221; on their business or to follow a certain trajectory, and he says that Mighty is certainly seeing kids who show up for a weekend to make some money. Still, he insists, many others have an undeniably entrepreneurial spirit and says they tend to stick around.  In fact, says Goldhirsh, the company &#8212; aided by its new seed funding &#8212; has much to do in order to keep its hungriest young CEOs happy.</p>
<p>Many are frustrated, for example, that they currently can&#8217;t sell their own homemade items through Mighty. Instead, they are invited to sell items like customizable hats, totes, and stickers made by Mighty&#8217;s current manufacturing partner, <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a>, which then ships out the item to the end customer. (The Mighty user gets a percentage of the sale, as does Mighty.)</p>
<p>The budding tycoons on the platform can also sell items made by global artisans through a partnership that Mighty has struck with <a href="https://www.novica.com/">Novica</a>, an impact marketplace that also sells through National Geographic.</p>
<p>The idea was to introduce as little friction into the process as possible at the outset, but &#8220;our customers are pissed &#8212; they want more from us,&#8221; says Goldhirsh, explaining that Mighty fully intends to one day enable its smaller entrepreneurs to sell their own items, as well as offer services (think lawn care), which the platform also does not support currently.</p>
<p>As for how it makes money, in addition to collecting transaction-based revenue, Mighty plans to layer in subscription services eventually, even while it&#8217;s not prepared to discuss these publicly quite yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s intriguing, on the whole, though the startup could need to fend off established players like Shopify should it begin to gain traction. It&#8217;s also conceivable that parents &#8212; if not children&#8217;s advocates &#8212;  could push back on what Mighty is trying to do. Entrepreneurship can be alternately exhilarating and demoralizing after all; it&#8217;s a roller coaster some might not want kids to ride from such a young age.</p>
<p>Mauriello insists they haven&#8217;t had that kind of feedback to date. For one thing, she says, Mighty recently launched an online community where its young CEOs can encourage one another and trade sales tips, and she says they are actively engaging there.</p>
<p>She also argues that, like sports or learning a musical instrument, there are lessons to be learned by creating a store on Mighty. Storytelling and how to sell are among them, but as critically, she says, the company&#8217;s young customers are learning that &#8220;you can fail and pick yourself back up and try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adds Goldhirsch, &#8220;There are definitely kids who are like, &#8216;Oh, this is harder than I thought it was going to be. I can&#8217;t just launch the site and watch money roll in.&#8217; But I think they like the fact that the success they are seeing they are earning, because we&#8217;re not doing it for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 2. We are heading into a holiday weekend here in the United States, so you might imagine that tech news slowed down. It did not, as we’ll see shortly.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"><strong>When SPACs attack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The United States Department of Justice is investigating Lordstown Motors, the embattled EV company that went public via a SPAC. Detractors of the company have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">punched holes in the story it told before going public</a>, and the company’s SPAC deck has proven to be somewhat, well, disconnected from reality. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">company needs more money</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">it turns out</a>, despite having told investors that it would not. Whoops.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/"><strong>China v. Didi v. American investors:</strong></a> Sticking to the theme of companies in trouble, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is in hot water with its own domestic regulators. The company has been told to halt new user registration, pending a cybersecurity review. Just <em>days</em> after it went public in the United States. Oof.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/jim-whitehurst-steps-down-as-president-at-ibm-just-14-months-after-taking-role/"><strong>IBM’s President steps down:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jim Whitehurst, who made his way to IBM via its Red Hat deal, is out. His tenure as president at the firm lasted 14 months. Details were light on his exit, per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> Yeesh.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Today’s startup news has a strong non-American bias. That’s because nearly everyone in the United States took most of today off, regardless of what their boss thought was going on. The rest of the world was still busy, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/"><strong>Licious raises tasty $192M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The Bangalore-based meat and seafood e-commerce player has now raised through a <em>Series F</em>. A few years back we would have joked that the F in Series F stood for “failed to go public,” but that’s no longer the case. Why <em>not</em> raise a Series F when money is so cheap? The company is now worth more than $650 million, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/swedish-gaming-giant-acquires-india-playsimple-for-360-million/"><strong>MTG buys PlaySimple for $360M:</strong></a> Why are investors betting so much money on the Indian startup ecosystem? Rising exit values, perhaps. TechCrunch noted that the sale of India’s PlaySimple to Swedish gaming giant was “one of the largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/"><strong>Tiger invests $40M into Nigerian neobank:</strong></a> It’s a big day for FairMoney, a Nigerian startup that has its genesis in offering consumers credit. It’s also yet another round for African fintech, a sector that has felt pretty active lately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter</h2>
<p>Did you hear about the CEO who made misleading claims about a funding round and got sued by the SEC? How about that pharmaceutical executive whose taunts to a former secretary of state led to a 4.4% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index?</p>
<p>In case it isn&#8217;t clear: Startup executives are held to a higher standard when it comes to what they post on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all,&#8221; says Lisa W. Liu, a senior partner at The Mitzel Group, a San Francisco-based law practice that serves many startups.</p>
<p>To help her clients (and Extra Crunch readers) stay out of trouble, Liu has six basic questions for tech execs with itchy Twitter fingers.</p>
<p>And if the answer to any of them is “I don’t know,” don’t post.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is a mixed bag, but a fun one. And each story has a strong California hook. Let’s begin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/"><strong>GM is investing in a California lithium extraction project:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Why? Batteries. Gotta have lithium to make batteries. No batteries, no electric cars. In this case the project is actually pretty neat, having a strong hook to Salton Sea Geothermal Field near Los Angeles in the southern part of the state. The geothermal field will provide power and materials. So perhaps electric cars’ pre-driving carbon footprint will be a bit more sustainable in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-colorful-misinformation-labels/">Twitter tests more attention-grabbing misinformation labels:</a> </strong>Twitter, a <em>California-based company</em>, is making its misinformation labeling a bit more standout. It’s fun to watch social media companies make warnings sterner at the same time as Google is making advertisements better blend into its organic results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/">Dutch court will hear another Facebook privacy lawsuit:</a> </strong>A few Dutch nonprofits are suing Facebook over alleged “rampant collection of internet users’ data — arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing,” TechCrunch summarized. This case <em>seems</em> like it could have broad import, depending on how it shakes out. Given, you know, how much data collection goes on literally all the time, literally everywhere, online.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, China ordered ride-hailing company Didi to stop signing up new customers after regulators announced a cybersecurity review of the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Didi&#8217;s stock price is down 5.3%. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm suggested that the move wasn&#8217;t a complete surprise, but it still &#8220;puts a bad taste in our mouths,&#8221; since the company went public days ago.</p>

<hr />
<p>When Didi filed to go public, it listed several potential pitfalls facing Chinese companies that go public in the U.S., including &#8220;numerous legal and regulatory risks&#8221; and &#8220;extensive government regulation and oversight in its F-1.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this news signify for other Chinese companies that are hoping for stateside IPOs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be off on Monday, July 5 in observance of Independence Day. Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<h2>3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2173281" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173281" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2173281" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg" alt="a miniature version of Rodin's &quot;The Thinker&quot; sculpture" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/neonbrand-2RRq1BHPq4E-unsplash.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173281" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/2RRq1BHPq4E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeONBRAND/Unsplash <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Did you hear about the CEO who made misleading claims about a funding round and got sued? How about that pharmaceutical executive whose taunts to a former Secretary of State led to a 4.4% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index?</p>
<p>In case it isn&#8217;t clear: Startup executives are held to a higher standard when it comes to what they post on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all,&#8221; says Lisa W. Liu, a senior partner at The Mitzel Group, a San Francisco-based law practice that serves many startups.</p>
<p>To help her clients (and Extra Crunch readers) Liu has six basic questions for tech execs with itchy Twitter fingers.</p>
<p>And if the answer to any of them is “I don’t know,” don’t post.</p>

<p>A report from Brighteye Ventures on Europe&#8217;s edtech scene shows that this year&#8217;s deal flow is on pace to meet or surpass 2020, when remote instruction exploded.</p>
<p>According to Brighteye&#8217;s head of Research, Rhys Spence, the average deal size is now $9.4 million, a threefold increase from last year. Still, &#8220;It’s interesting that we are not seeing enormous increases in deal count,&#8221; he noted.</p>

<p>Trading platform Robinhood has attracted enough users and activity to change the conversation around retail investing — economists will likely be discussing the 2021 GameStop saga for years to come.</p>
<p>After the company filed to go public yesterday, Alex Wilhelm sorted through Robinhood&#8217;s main income statement to better understand how it scaled year-ago revenue from $127.6 million to $522.2 million in Q1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are numbers that we frankly do not see often amongst companies going public,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;300% growth is a pre-Series A metric, usually.&#8221;</p>
<p>So: where is all that revenue coming from?</p>

<p>Given the valuation gap between U.S. tech markets and those overseas, it&#8217;s easy to see why some foreign startups would head to our shores when it&#8217;s time to go public.</p>
<p>But Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm found that a record increase in European venture capital activity is picking up the pace of IPOs this year, and many of these companies are content to go public in their native markets.</p>
<p>To gain some insight into where European investors believe they have an advantage, Anna and Alex interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franck Sebag, partner, EY</li>
<li>David Miranda, partner, Osborne Clarke Spain</li>
<li>Yoram Wijngaarde, founder and CEO, Dealroom</li>
</ul>

<h2>How VCs can get the most out of co-investing alongside LPs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2171619" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171619" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171619" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg" alt="A red and a green shoe tied together" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1255444114.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171619" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Diana_Ilieva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Ilieva <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>In a recent private equity survey, 80% of respondents said their co-investments with people outside traditional VC firms outperformed their PE fund investments.</p>
<p>Alternative investors are highly motivated, and because they’re seeking higher returns than are generally available in public markets, they are less daunted by risk. In return, they benefit from less expensive fee structures and develop close ties with VCs, enlarging the talent pool as they build investment skills.</p>
<p>These relationships have direct benefits for VCs as well, such as more flexibility with diversification and consolidated decision-making power.</p>
<p>“With the right deal structure, deal selection and deal investigation, co-investors can significantly increase their returns,” says C5 Capital Managing Partner William Kilmer, who wrote an Extra Crunch post for VCs considering an alternative path.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My husband and I are both U.S. permanent residents.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given what we’ve gone through this past year being isolated from loved ones during the pandemic, we’d like to bring my parents and my sister to the U.S. to be close to our family and help out with our children.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Symbiotic in Sunnyvale</strong></p>

<p>Smart-building products include everything from connecting landlords with tenants to managing construction sites.</p>
<p>Given their widespread impact on the enterprise — and the novel nature of much of this new technology, selecting the right digital building platform (DBP) is a challenge for most organizations.</p>
<p>Brian Turner, LEED-AP BD&amp;C, has created a matrix intended to help decision-makers identify the fundamental functions and desired outcomes for stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to the built environment, creating those comfortable, healthy and enjoyable places requires new tools,&#8221; says Turner. &#8220;Selecting a solid DBP is one of the most important decisions to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>One perennial problem inside startups: Because no one on the founding team has significant marketing experience, growth-related efforts are pro forma and generally unlikely to move the needle.</p>
<p>Everyone wants higher click-through rates, but creating ads that “stand out” is a risky strategy, especially when you don’t know what you’re doing. This guest post by Demand Curve offers seven strategies for boosting CTR that you can clone and deploy today inside your own startup.</p>
<p>Here’s one: If customers are talking about you online, reach out to ask if you can add a screenshot of their reviews to your advertising. Testimonials are a form of social proof that boost conversions, and they’re particularly effective when used in retargeting ads.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we ran another post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/demand-curve-email-marketing-tactics-that-convert-subscribers-into-customers/">optimizing email marketing for early-stage startups</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have more expert growth advice coming soon, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Locking down data centers and networks against intruders is just one aspect of an organization’s security responsibilities; cloud services, collaboration tools and APIs extend security perimeters even farther. What’s more, the systems created to prevent the misuse and mishandling of sensitive data often depend heavily on someone’s better angels.</p>
<p>According to Sid Trivedi, a partner at Foundation Capital, and seven-time CIO Mark Settle, IT managers need to replace existing DLP frameworks with a new one that centers on DMP — data misuse protection.</p>
<p>These solutions “will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters,” and many startups are already competing in this space.</p>
