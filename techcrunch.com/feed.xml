										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> isn&#8217;t widely known yet outside of the crypto community. But insiders think the blockchain platform is interesting for a wide variety of reasons, beginning with its amiable founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, who spent more than a dozen years as an engineer working on wireless protocols at Qualcomm and who says he had a lightbulb moment at a San Francisco cafe several years ago following two coffees and a beer.</p>
<p>His big idea centered on creating an historical record to speed along &#8220;consensus,&#8221; which is how decisions are made on blockchains, which are themselves peer-to-peer systems.</p>
<p>Right now, consensus is reached on various blockchains when members solve a mathematical puzzle, a mechanism that&#8217;s called &#8220;proof of work.&#8221; These miners are rewarded for their efforts with cryptocurrency, but the process an hour in Bitcoin&#8217;s case and a minute in the case of Ethereum, and it&#8217;s insanely energy intensive, which is why neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has proved very scalable. (Bitcoin&#8217;s heavy reliance on fossil fuel is the reason Elon Musk cited earlier this week to explain why Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin as payment for the company&#8217;s electric cars.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/embed/#?secret=uHmttIQVKX" data-secret="uHmttIQVKX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But there is another way. Indeed, crypto watchers and developers are excited about Ethereum and <a href="https://decrypt.co/70883/proof-of-stake-coins-surge-as-elon-musk-trashes-power-hungry-bitcoin">other currencies</a> that are transitioning to a new system called &#8220;proof of stake,&#8221; wherein people who agree to lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency are invited to activate so-called validator software that enables them to store data, process transactions, and add new blocks to the blockchain. Like miners, &#8220;validators&#8221; take on the role to earn more cryptocurrency, but they need far less sophisticated equipment, which opens up the opportunity to more people. Meanwhile, because more validators can participate in a network, consensus can be reached faster.</p>
<p>Yakovenko is enthusiastic about the shift.  We talked with him yesterday, and he&#8217;s certainly not rooting against Ethereum, saying it would be &#8220;devastating for the entire industry&#8221; if Ethereum weren&#8217;t able to pull off its transition to proof of stake given its mindshare and its roughly $500 billion market cap.</p>
<p>Still, he argues that not even proof of stake is good enough. The reason, he says, is that even with proof of stake, miners &#8212; and bots &#8212; have advance access to transaction information that allows them to exploit users, or front run transactions, because they can control transaction ordering.</p>
<p>Enter Yakovenko&#8217;s big idea, which he calls &#8220;proof of history,&#8221; wherein the Solana blockchain has developed a kind of synchronized clock that, in essence, assigns a timestamp for each transaction and disables the ability for miners and bots to decide the order of which transactions get recorded onto the blockchain. Yakovenko says it also allows for faster block finalization and much faster consensus because the timestamps of previous transactions no longer need to be computed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the speed of light is how fast we can make this network go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, Solana &#8212; which has sold tokens to investors but never equity in the company &#8212; has many excited about its prospects. In recent interviews with both investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/early-coinbase-backer-garry-tan-is-keeping-the-vast-majority-of-his-shares-because-of-this-deal/">Garry Tan</a> of Initialized Capital and CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/a-conversation-with-bison-trails-the-aws-like-service-inside-of-coinbase/">Joe Lallouz</a> of the blockchain infrastructure company Bison Trails, both mentioned Solana as among the projects they find most interesting right now. (We assume both hold its tokens.)</p>

<p>Others say on background that while they understand the developer benefits and need for more scaleable blockchains than Ethereum, Solana still needs to more developer mindshare to prove its long-term worth and it&#8217;s not there yet. According to Solana itself, there are currently 608 validators helping secure the Solana Network and 47 decentralized applications (or &#8220;dapps&#8221;) powered by Solana. Meawhile, they were reportedly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/valid-points-unlocking-ethereum-2-0-staking-explained">33,700 active validators</a> helping to secure &#8220;Eth 2.0&#8221; as of late December and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/which-crypto-dapps-are-on-ethereum">3,000</a> dapps running on the Ethereum blockchain as of February.</p>
<p>In fairness, the Ethereum network went live in 2015, so it has a three-year head start on Solana. In the meantime, Solana has a lead of its own, says Yakovenko, who is based in San Francisco and has assembled a distributed team of 50 employees, including numerous former Qualcomm colleagues. Asked about other projects that have embraced a proof-of-history approach, he says that while it&#8217;s &#8220;all open source&#8221; and &#8220;anybody can go do it,&#8221; there &#8220;isn&#8217;t a set of our biggest competitors saying they&#8217;re going to rework their system and use this.&#8221;</p>
<p>One likely reason is that it&#8217;s almost comically complicated. &#8220;It just takes a lot of work to build these systems,&#8221; Yakovenko says. &#8220;It takes two to three years to build a new layer one, and you can&#8217;t really take an idea for one and stuff it in the other one. If you try to do that, you&#8217;re going to set yourself back by six to nine months at the least and potentially introduce bugs and vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, Solana, which itself has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOL1-USD/">$12 billion</a> market cap, isn&#8217;t interested in competing with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies on every front anyway, suggests Yakovenko. All it really wants is to completely disrupt Wall Street and the rest of the global markets, even if he doesn&#8217;t put it that way exactly.</p>
<p>He knows it sounds crazy. But the way he sees it, what Solana is building is &#8220;an open, fair, censorship-resistant global marketplace&#8221; that&#8217;s better than anything inside of the New York Stock Exchange or any other means of settling trades. It&#8217;s certainly a much bigger opportunity than he imagined, backed at that cafe.</p>
<p>As he said yesterday: &#8220;Everything that we do to make this thing faster and faster results in this better censorship resistance, and therefore better markets. And price discovery is what I imagine is the killer use case for decentralized public networks. Can we be the world&#8217;s price discovery engine? That&#8217;s an interesting question to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He&#8217;s far from alone in pondering the possibilities. Pointing to the wild swings in cryptocurrency prices right now, he says he suspects that &#8220;part of that is just developers and folks discovering the network and building cool applications on it.&#8221; It&#8217;s exciting when people can &#8220;self serve and build stuff that they want to go to market,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;It&#8217;s the secret weapon of decentralized networks versus any incumbents like Bank of America or Visa or whatever. Those big companies can&#8217;t iterate and move as fast as global set of engineers who can just come together and code whenever they want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw very similar dynamics play at Qualcomm, in fact. &#8220;Working in a big company, it seems like there&#8217;s a ton of resources, right? They can accomplish anything. But you saw us working on proprietary operating systems while the Linux guys were just working first for fun, right? And it seemed like it was just a weird hobby that people had; they were coding operating systems at night; they were coding over the weekend. Then all of a sudden, Linux is the de facto mobile iOS of Android.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;re curious to learn more about Solana, we&#8217;ll have a podcast coming out soon with our longer conversation with Yakovenko. In the meantime, the outlet Decrypt today published an explainer titled &#8220;What is Solana?&#8221; that you might check out <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps">here</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Twilio had a market cap approaching $56 billion and more than 200,000 customers, the cloud-communications platform developed a secret sauce to fuel its growth: a developer-focused model that dispensed with traditional marketing rules.</p>
<p>Software companies that sell directly to end users share a simple framework for managing growth that leverages discoverability, desirability and do-ability — the “aha!” moment where a consumer is able to incorporate a new product into their workflow.</p>
<p>Data show that traditional marketing doesn’t work on developers, and it&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re impervious to a sales pitch. Builders just want reliable tools that are easy to use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, companies that are looking to create and sell software to developers at scale must toss their B2B playbooks and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/saas-companies-can-grow-to-20m-arr-by-selling-exclusively-to-developers/">meet their customers where they are</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Attorney Sophie Alcorn, our in-house immigration law expert, submitted two columns: On Monday, she analyzed a decision by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security <strong>not</strong> to cancel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">the International Entrepreneur Parole program</a>, which potentially allows founders from other countries to stay in the U.S. for as long as 60 months.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, she responded to a question from an entrepreneur who asked whether it made sense to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dear-sophie-does-it-make-sense-to-sponsor-immigrant-talent-to-work-remotely/">sponsor visas for workers who are working remotely</a> inside the U.S.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week, and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>Can you imagine making 13 attempts at something before attaining a successful outcome?</p>
<p>Alex Circei, CEO and co-founder of Git analytics tool Waydev, applied 13 times to Y Combinator before his team was accepted. Each year, the accelerator admits only about 5% of the startups that seek to join.</p>
<p>“Competition may be fierce, but it’s not impossible,” says Circei. “Jumping through some hoops is not only worth the potential payoff but is ultimately a valuable learning curve for any startup.”</p>
<p>In an exclusive exposé for TechCrunch, he shares four key lessons he learned while steering his startup through YC’s stringent selection process.</p>
<p>The first? “Put your business value before your personal vanity.”</p>

<p>In March, TechCrunch Daily Reporter Anna Heim was interviewing executives at Expensify to learn more about the company&#8217;s history and operations when they unexpectedly made themselves less available.</p>
<p>Our suspicions about their change of heart were confirmed on May 3 when the expense report management company confidentially filed to go public.</p>
<p>With a founding team comprised mainly of P2P hackers, it&#8217;s perhaps inevitable that Expensify doesn&#8217;t look and feel like something an MBA might envision.</p>
<p>“We hire in a super different way. We have a very unusual internal management structure,&#8221; said founder and CEO David Barrett. &#8220;Our business model itself is very unusual. We don’t have any salespeople, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar to the way companies must file a Form S-1 that describes their operations and how they plan to spend capital, TechCrunch EC-1s are part origin story, part X-ray. We published the first article in a series on Expensify on Monday:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant</a>” (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Explores the founders’ days with a P2P content distribution startup called Red Swoosh (Travis Kalanick’s venture before Uber) and how that experience influenced Expensify&#8217;s development.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll publish the remainder of Anna&#8217;s series on Expensify in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Construction tech unicorn Procore Technologies this week set a price range for its impending public offering. The news comes after the company initially filed to go public in February of 2020, a move delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p>In March 2021, Procore filed again for a public offering, but its second shot ran into a cooling IPO market. The company filed another S-1/A in April, and then another in early May. This week&#8217;s filing is the first that sets a price for the Carpinteria, California-based software upstart.</p>
<p>But Procore is not the only company that filed and later put on hold an IPO to get back to work on floating. Kaltura, a software company focused on video distribution, also recently got its IPO back on track. Are we seeing a reacceleration of the IPO market? Perhaps.</p>

<p>If you have heard of Better.com but really had no idea what it does before this moment, welcome to the club. Mortgage tech is like pre-kindergarten applications — it applies to a very specific set of folks at a very particular moment. And they care a lot about it. But the rest of us aren’t really aware of its existence.</p>
<p>Better.com, a venture-backed digital mortgage lender, announced this week that it will combine with a SPAC, taking itself public in the second half of 2021. The unicorn’s news comes as the American IPO market is showing signs of fresh life after a modest April.</p>

<p>The pandemic forced many employees to begin working from home, and, in doing so, may have changed the way we think about work. While some businesses have slowly returned to the office, depending on where you live and what you do, many information workers remain at home.</p>
<p>That could change in the coming months as more people get vaccinated and the infection rate begins to drop in the U.S.</p>
<p>Many companies have discovered that their employees work just fine at home. And some workers don’t want to waste time stuck on congested highways or public transportation now that they’ve learned to work remotely. But other employees suffered in small spaces or with constant interruptions from family. Those folks may long to go back to the office.</p>
<p>On balance, it seems clear that whatever happens, for many companies, we probably aren’t going back whole-cloth to the prior model of commuting into the office five days a week.</p>

<p>On a recent episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm invited Yext CFO Steve Cakebread and Latch CFO Garth Mitchell on to discuss when companies should go public, the costs and benefits of the process and when a SPAC can make sense. Yext pursued a traditional IPO a few years back; Latch is now going public via a blank-check company combination.</p>
<p>The chat was more than illustrative, as we got to hear two CFOs share their views on delayed public offerings and when different types of debuts can make the most sense. While the TechCrunch crew has, at times, made light of certain SPAC-led deals, the pair argued that the transactions can make good sense.</p>
<p>Undergirding the conversation was Cakebread’s recent IPO-focused book, which not only posited that companies going public earlier rather than later is good for their internal operations but also because it can provide the public with a chance to participate in a company’s success.</p>
<p>In today’s hypercharged private markets and frothy public domain, his argument is worth considering.</p>

<p>Ken Harlan, the founder and CEO of Mobile Fuse, writes about the perks and pitfalls of software development kits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The digital media industry often talks about how much influence, dominance and power entities like Google and Facebook have,&#8221; Harlan writes. &#8220;Generally, the focus is on the vast troves of data and audience reach these companies tout. However, there’s more beneath the surface that strengthens the grip these companies have on both app developers and publishers alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality, SDK integrations are a critical component of why these monolith companies have such a prominent presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Exchange caught up with Appian CEO Matt Calkins after his enterprise app software company reported its first-quarter performance to discuss the low-code market and what he’s hearing in customer meetings. To round out our general thesis — and shore up our somewhat bratty headline — we’ve compiled a list of recent low-code and no-code venture capital rounds, of which there are many.</p>
<p>As we’ll show, the pace at which venture capitalists are putting funds into companies that fall into our two categories is pretty damn rapid, which implies that they are doing well as a cohort. We can infer as much because it has become clear in recent quarters that while today’s private capital market is stupendous for some startups, it’s harder than you’d think for others.</p>

<p>Historically — and based on what we’re seeing in this fantastical filing — Bird proved to be a simply awful business. Its results from 2019 and 2020 describe a company with a huge cost structure and unprofitable revenue, per filings. After posting negative gross profit in both of the most recent full-year periods, Bird’s initial model appears to have been defeated by the market.</p>
<p>What drove the company’s hugely unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses? Unit economics that were nearly comically destructive.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Today, we live in a world of product-led growth, where engineers (and the software they have built) are the biggest differentiator,&#8221; says Coatue Management general partner Caryn Marooney and investor David Cahn. &#8220;If your customers love what you’re building, you’re headed in the right direction. If they don’t, you’re not.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, even the most successful product-led growth companies will reach a tipping point, because no matter how good their product is, they’ll need to figure out how to expand their customer base and grow from a startup into a $1 billion+ revenue enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer is the hamburger model. Why call it that? Because the best go-to-market (GTM) strategies for startups are like hamburgers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The bottom bun:</strong> Bottom-up GTM.</li>
<li><strong>The burger:</strong> Your product.</li>
<li><strong>The top bun:</strong> Enterprise sales.&#8221;</li>

<p>Krish Subramanian, the co-founder and CEO of Chargebee, writes that while subscription business models are attractive, there are two major pitfalls: First, payment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of company size, there’s an ongoing need to convince customers to sign up long term,&#8221; Subramanian writes. &#8220;The second issue: How do businesses cover the funding gap between when customers sign up and when they pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Scott Lenet, the president of Touchdown Ventures, asks how deal-makers should think about how to handle themselves when counter-parties attempt to change an agreement. &#8220;When is it OK to modify terms, and when should deal-makers stand firm?&#8221; he asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs and investors should recognize that contracts are worth very little without the ongoing relationship management that keeps all parties aligned. Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path. In my experience, good communication is the only reliable remedy. <em>This</em> is the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search engine optimization, PR, paid marketing, emails, social — marketing and communications is crowded with techniques, channels, solutions and acronyms,&#8221; writes Dominik Angerer, CEO and co-founder of Storyblok, which provides best practice guidance for startups on how to build a sustainable approach to marketing their content. &#8220;It’s little wonder that many startups strapped for time and money find defining and executing a sustainable marketing campaign a daunting prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheer number of options makes it difficult to determine an effective approach, and my view is that this complexity often obscures the obvious answer: A startup’s best marketing asset is its story.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/"><strong>Coding school drama</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The market for coding schools and bootcamps is not going to go away so long as there is an outsized market demand for developers that current educational methods can’t fulfill. But not every player in the market is doing well. Lambda School, for example, is in even more hot water this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/edtech-stocks-are-getting-hammered-but-vcs-keep-writing-checks/"><strong>VCs love edtech</strong></a><strong>: </strong>While private investors are happily pouring capital into the edtech startup market, the share prices of many public edtech companies are under fire. That’s a sentiment gap that TechCrunch is keeping close tabs on. More <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">here</a> on the edtech venture market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/deadline-extended-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/"><strong>Apply to Startup Battlefield</strong></a><strong>: </strong>There’s not a lot of time left to apply to the upcoming Disrupt Startup Battlefield. And we want to hear from you. Really. Many startups that have taken part in our free and fun and very public pitch-off have gone on to raise lots of capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">or even go public</a>. So hang out with us; we think you’re great!</p>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool/"><strong>Stripe buys Bouncer</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The progress of the yet-private Stripe as an online finance behemoth continued today with its purchase of Bouncer, a startup based in Brooklyn that TechCrunch reports has “built a platform to automatically run card authentications and detect fraud in card-based online transactions.” Fraud detection is a point of product differentiation among online payment companies, so this is a deal to watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/why-spacs-arent-targeting-african-startups/"><strong>Why aren’t more African startups going public?</strong></a> The SPAC boom is taking a host of American startups public, but not upstart tech companies from Africa. The real issue could simply be one of scale, it turns out. TechCrunch investigates.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/hundreds-of-spacs-waiting-in-the-woods/"><strong>SoftBank makes piles of money</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Some of the bets that SoftBank has made on its own, and via its Vision Fund 1 and 2, have been clunkers. WeWork remains a byword for embarrassment. But the teleco and investing powerhouse has been on a heater lately, as TechCrunch’s Equity Podcast explored. How good were its results? Very, very well. More on its investing performance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/echelon-leaky-api-riders-account-data/"><strong>Don’t leak customer account data</strong></a><strong>: </strong>An exercise startup that competes with Peloton didn’t have its cybersecurity house in order. Echelon, TechCrunch reports, “had a leaky API that let virtually anyone access riders’ account information.” That’s all kinds of not good. And the news item explains why cybersecurity has been so hot lately. More tech everywhere means more potential vulnerabilities everywhere, as well.</p>
<h2>5 ways to raise your startup’s PR game</h2>
<p>By now, it&#8217;s widely understood that storytelling is the foundation for successful startup PR.</p>
<p>Tech journalists receive more pitches than we can count each day from very early-stage companies seeking to make a name for themselves, and, to be honest, most of them sound like they were written with language-prediction technology.</p>
<p>What most companies fail to grasp is that storytelling is everyone&#8217;s job, like product managers who write blog posts that give users real insights into the latest release. The same holds true for founders who take part in Reddit AMAs and engineers who join product Slack chats.</p>
<p>To make a splash and stay relevant, here are five actionable suggestions that won’t cost a dime to implement.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Wrapping up news from the biggest tech companies this week, a short digest of earnings results from companies that you care about is in order.</p>
<p>Coinbase met its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">pre-released Q1 2020 earnings expectations</a>, posting both huge revenue and profit gains. In short, the first quarter was a huge win for the crypto trading house. It had the same sort of quarter that likely led to Robinhood filing to go public.</p>
<p>DoorDash blew the, er, doors off <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Releases-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">its own quarter</a>, leading to its shares spiking by around 25% in today’s trading. That’s one hell of a result. Sure, DoorDash is worth a lot less than it was at its peak, but the company had a great day all the same.</p>
<p>Airbnb managed a roughly 2.5% gain today after reporting <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-first-quarter-2021-financial-results/">its own earnings</a> yesterday. It also got an analyst upgrade to boot. In short, the company managed year-over-year revenue growth, but also detailed larger-than-anticipated losses thanks to some one-time items. Worth around $85 billion, Airbnb remains richly valued.</p>
<p>And then there was Alibaba, which has lost <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/alibaba-earnings-q4-net-loss-after-2point8-billion-antitrust-fine.html">around a quarter-trillion in value</a> since it got into a scrap with its local administration and <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210513.pdf">swung to a loss</a> after it was served with a multibillion dollar fine by the Chinese government. But the e-commerce giant’s $28.6 billion in total revenue was up 64% compared to its year-ago result. Hot <em>dang</em>.</p>
<p>Now you are all caught up! Have a lovely weekend, and we’ll see you again Monday afternoon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve seen a good Easter egg out of Google. Not too long ago it felt like someone would discover a new hidden gag in Google&#8217;s products every few weeks. The company cranked them out like it was their job.</p>
<p>While we haven&#8217;t seen as many new ones pop up lately, it looks like they&#8217;re still finding their way in. The latest: with the right search terms, you can make the Google search page act like an early aughts media player thats been left idling too long.</p>
<p><strong>How to activate it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Be on Google on a desktop browser. It doesn&#8217;t seem to work on mobile.</li>
<li>Search for &#8220;DVD screensaver&#8221;. &#8220;DVD bouncing logo&#8221; appears to work, as well.</li>
<li>Wait about five seconds and the logo should start a-bouncin&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#8217;s the point? Like most good easter eggs, the only answer to that is &#8220;I dunno, it&#8217;s fun!&#8221; Kill time by seeing if it ever hits the corner. Tell your co-workers about it so they know <em>for a fact</em> you&#8217;re reading dumb stuff on the Internet instead of working. Happy Friday!</p>
<p><em>[As far as I can tell, this egg was first pointed out on Twitter by Google engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/_zouhir/status/1392608904178135042">Zouhir Chahoud</a>. Thanks Zouhir!]</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[We decided to dig into the company's financials to see just what challenges Bill Staples might face as he moves into the corner office.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Bill Staples, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/new-relic-is-bringing-in-a-new-ceo-as-founder-lew-cirne-moves-to-executive-chairman-role/">the freshly appointed CEO</a> at New Relic, who takes over on July 1, yesterday was a good day. After more than 20 years in the industry, he was given his own company to run. It&#8217;s quite an accomplishment, but now the hard work begins.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			On the positive side of the equation, New Relic is one of the market leaders in the application performance monitoring space.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Lew Cirne, New Relic’s founder and CEO, who is stepping into the executive chairman role, spent the last several years rebuilding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/new-relic-shifts-with-changing-monitoring-landscape/">the company&#8217;s platform</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/">changing its revenue model</a>, aiming for what he hopes is long-term success.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the work we did in re-platforming our data tier and our user interface and the migration to consumption business model, that&#8217;s not so we can be a $1 billion New Relic &#8212; it&#8217;s so we can be a multibillion-dollar New Relic. And we are willing to forgo some short-term opportunity and take some short-term pain in order to set us up for long-term success,&#8221; Cirne told TechCrunch after yesterday&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>On the positive side of the equation, New Relic is one of the market leaders in the application performance monitoring space. <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-application-performance-monitoring/">Gartner has the company</a> in third place behind Dynatrace and Cisco AppDynamics, and ahead of DataDog. While the Magic Quadrant might not be gospel, it does give you a sense of the relative market positions of each company in a given space.</p>
<p>New Relic competes in the application performance monitoring business, or APM for short. APM enables companies to keep tabs on the health of their applications. That allows them to cut off problems before they happen, or at least figure out why something is broken more quickly. In a world where users can grow frustrated quickly, APM is an important part of the customer experience infrastructure. If your application isn&#8217;t working well, customers won&#8217;t be happy with the experience and quickly find a rival service to use.</p>
<p>In addition to yesterday&#8217;s CEO announcement, New Relic reported earnings. TechCrunch decided to dig into the company&#8217;s financials to see just what challenges Staples may face as he moves into the corner office. The resulting picture is one that shows a company doing hard work for a more future-aligned product map and business model, albeit one that may not generate the sort of near-term growth that gives Staples ample breathing room with public investors.</p>
<h2>Near-term growth, long-term hopes</h2>
<p>Making long-term bets on a company’s product and business model future can be difficult for Wall Street to swallow in the near term. But such work can garner an incredibly lucrative result; Adobe is a good example of a company that went from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/adobes-complex-journey-from-boxes-to-the-cloud/">license sales to subscription incomes</a>. There are others in the midst of similar transitions, and they often take growth penalties as older revenues are recycled in favor of a new top line.</p>
<p>So when we observe New Relic’s recent result and guidance for the rest of the year, we’re more looking for future signs of life than quick gains.</p>
<p>Starting with the basics, New Relic had a better-than-anticipated quarter. An <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3696166-new-relic-eps-beats-0_19-beats-on-revenue">analysis</a> showed the company’s profit and adjusted profit per share both beat expectations. And the company announced $173 million in total revenue, around $6 million more than the market expected.</p>
<p>So, did its shares rise? Yes, but just 5%, leaving them far under their 52-week high. Why such a modest bump after so strong a report? The company’s guidance, we reckon. Per New Relic, it expects its current quarter to bring 6% to 7% growth compared to the year-ago period. And it anticipates roughly 6% growth for its current fiscal year (its fiscal 2022, which will conclude at the end of calendar Q1 2022).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Governor Gavin Newsom, a vocal proponent of electric vehicles, on Friday debuted a new proposal that would earmark $3.2 billion to boost EV infrastructure and adoption in the state.</p>
<p>“This is a big deal,” Newsom said at a press conference Friday. &#8220;The Biden administration&#8217;s been talking a lot about this, they’re hoping to do something with the Senate, but we’re doing it. We’re not waiting around.”</p>
<p>Over half of the $3.2 billion budget would go toward replacing 1,150 trucks, 1,000 transit buses and 1,000 school buses with electric models. Another $800 million would be put toward the state’s Clean Cars 4 All program, which aims to help lower-income drivers upgrade to a zero- or near-zero car, as well as further rebates or clean vehicles. The proposal earmarks $500 million toward infrastructure and $250 million would go toward manufacturing grants. Newsom did not specify what type of infrastructure programs would qualify; it&#8217;s likely those funds would go toward charging.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Hyundai, we hope you are listening,” Newsom said, referring to the automaker’s announcement Thursday that it would <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-to-invest-7-4-billion-in-the-us-by-2025--301291011.html">invest $7.4 billion</a> in the United States to manufacture EVs through 2025.</p>

<p>“Let’s start to wake up to the opportunities not to be reliant on foreign adversaries or interventions from those looking to extract resources through cyberattacks and/or other foreign governments that can abuse their privileges and rights as it relates to security and availability of fossil fuels,” he said. His comments were likely in reference to the recent cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline, which has led to gas shortages in swathes of the eastern United States.</p>
<p>The funds are a small sliver of his proposed $100 billion economic recovery package, dubbed “California Roars Back.” If it’s approved by the state legislature, it would be the largest recovery plan in the state&#8217;s history. Other proposals included in the package are nearly $1 billion to improve the state electric grid and invest in energy storage, green hydrogen and offshore wind development.</p>
<p>Last September, Newsom signed an executive order to phase out internal combustion engine passenger vehicles from being sold in the state by 2035. Transportation accounts for over half of all carbon emissions in the state.</p>

For those involved in the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) industry, a notoriously relationship-driven business, this has meant in-person boardroom handshakes have been replaced by <a href="https://www.themiddlemarket.com/news-analysis/virtual-dealmaking-is-here-to-say-according-to-dealmakers">video conference calls, remote collaboration</a> and potentially less travel in the future.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Research shows that AI will transform the M&amp;A process by decreasing the time it takes to perform due diligence to less than a month in 2025 from three to six months in 2020.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pandemic has also accelerated digital transformation, and deal-makers have embraced digital tools, sometimes even <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/coronavirus-goldman-sachs-bankers-using-flying-drones-on-ma-deals.html">drones</a>, to help them execute effectively. Even legal M&amp;A professionals, often among the major holdouts to embrace remote work and technologies, are increasingly using technology to automate common time-consuming tasks, such as redaction and contract analysis. And with a <a href="https://www.datasite.com/us/en/insights/reports/legal-dealmakers-market-report--capitalizing-on-momentum.html">vast majority</a> of them reporting permanent remote or hybrid work arrangements, further technology adoption is expected.</p>
<p>The quickening pace of digital transformation is no longer about ensuring a competitive edge. Today, it’s also about business resilience. But what’s on the horizon, and how else will technology evolve to meet the needs of companies and deal-makers?</p>
<p>There are still many inefficiencies in managing M&amp;A, but technologies such as artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, are helping to make the process faster and easier.</p>
<h2>AI helping sell-side prepare deals and conduct diligence</h2>
<p>Typical deals require the analysis of huge amounts of data in a relatively short period of time. So, when time is money, tools that speed up the M&amp;A process are critical. That’s why AI-powered tools that help deal-makers automate tasks, reduce human error and ensure greater regulatory compliance are gaining interest.</p>
<p>For example, when it comes to selling a business or asset, one of the most challenging parts of the M&amp;A process is organizing and preparing the files needed for review by potential investors or purchasers. Investment banking analysts often spend weeks reviewing thousands of files to figure out how to organize them and prepare them for a transaction.</p>
<p>Using statistical methods that allow a system to learn from data, and then make decisions, AI and machine learning leverage an algorithm to sift through those large volumes of data and content. Such <a href="https://www.datasite.com/us/en/company/news/media-coverage/m-atech--datasite-to-launch-new-categorization-tool-powered-by-a.html">a tool</a> can then enable the upload of hundreds or thousands of files and their review by an AI engine, which reads the files and suggests categories, as well as appropriate folder locations, for the files. AI and machine learning streamline the process in a matter of minutes, not weeks, freeing up deal-makers to focus on higher-value activities.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Whether you&#8217;re building a company or thinking about investing, it&#8217;s important to understand your strategic advantage. In order to determine one, you should ask fundamental questions like: What&#8217;s the long-term, sustainable reason that the company will stay in business?</p>
<p>The most important elements for founders to consider when figuring out their strategic advantage(s) include <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects">one-sided or &#8220;direct&#8221; network effects</a> (e.g., with social media sites like Facebook), <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeghaffary/2019/05/14/how-a-venture-capitalist-would-look-at-ubers-value-today-its-all-about-the-marketplace/?sh=996467732fbc">marketplace network effects</a> (e.g., with two-sided marketplaces like Uber), <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/business-moats-competitive-advantage/">data moats</a>, first mover and switching costs.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at an example of one-sided <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects">network effects</a>. At the very earliest stages of Facebook&#8217;s existence, it was just Mark Zuckerberg, a few friends and their basic profiles. The nascent social media platform wasn&#8217;t useful beyond a few dorm rooms. They needed a strategic advantage or the company would not make it beyond the edge of campus.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A successful startup without a strategic advantage is just a validated business model vulnerable to copycat companies looking for a market entry point.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In fact, Facebook only truly became a useful platform — and accelerated as a business — when more users came into the fold and more types of email addresses were accepted. Add to that the introduction of an ad marketplace revenue model and you have a clear strategic advantage — based on one-sided network effects — that gave Facebook a strategic edge over other early social media sites like MySpace.</p>
<p>These one-sided network effects are different from two-sided network effects.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152092" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152092" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2152092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?w=680" alt="A strategic advantage is paramount to maintaining market share" width="680" height="327" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=768,370 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=680,327 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=1536,739 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-3.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canvas Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>Two-sided network effects are most common in marketplace business models. In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/10/strategies-for-two-sided-markets ">two-sided network</a>, supply and demand are matched, like Uber riders (demand) being matched with Uber drivers (supply). The Uber product is not necessarily more valuable just because more users (riders) join, the way Facebook is more valuable when more users join.</p>
<p>In fact, when more users (riders) join the demand side of the Uber network, it might actually be <em>worse </em>for the user experience — it&#8217;s harder to find a driver and wait times get longer. The demand side (riders) gets value from more supply (drivers) joining the platform and vice-versa. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a two-sided network, or a marketplace.</p>
<p>Regardless of industry, a successful startup without a strategic advantage is just a validated business model vulnerable to copycat companies looking for a market entry point. Copycats can range in size from startups with similar grit to large companies like Facebook or Google that have limitless resources to drive competition into the market, and potentially run the startup with the original idea out of business. This vulnerability can prove fatal unless a startup&#8217;s founding team explores and embraces one or more strategic advantages.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Apple, Microsoft and the like were scrambling to bring their respective developer conferences online, Google made the executive design to just scrap I/O outright last year. It was a bit of an odd one, but the show went on through news-related blog posts.</p>
<p>While we’re going to have to wait another year to darken the doors of Mountain View’s Shoreline Amphitheater, the company has opted to go virtual for the 2021 version of the show. Understandably so. Google apparently has a lot up its sleeves this time.</p>
<p>Last month, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai teased some big news on the tech giant’s investor call, noting, “Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. Particularly excited that our developer event &#8212; Google I/O &#8212; is back this year, all virtual, and free for everyone on May 18th-20th. We’ll have significant product updates and announcements, and I invite you all to tune in.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the sound of it, next week’s event will find Google returning to form following what was a rough year for just about everyone. So, what can we expect from the developer-focused event?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141775" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141775" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg 2171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=2048,1303 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-458243847.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141775" class="wp-caption-text">Forest Row, East Sussex, UK &#8211; July 30th 2013: Android figure shot in home studio on white. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> juniorbeep / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Android 12 is the biggie, of course. From a software development standpoint, it’s a lynchpin to Google’s ecosystem, and for good reason has pretty much always taken centerstage at the event.</p>
<p>The developer version of Google’s mobile operating system has been kicking for a while now, but it has offered surprisingly little insight into what features might be coming. That’s either because it’s going to be a relatively minor upgrade as far as these things go or because the company it choosing to leave something to the imagination ahead of an official unveiling.</p>

<p>What we do know so far is that the operating system is getting a design upgrade. Beyond that, however, there are still a lot of question marks.</p>
<p>Google Assistant is likely to get some serious stage time, as well, coupled with some updates to the company’s ever-growing Home/Nest offerings. Whether that will mean, say, new smart displays on Nest speakers is uncertain. Keep in mind, hardware is anything but a given. The big Pixel event, after all, generally comes in the fall. That said, June is an ideal mid-marker during the year to refresh some other lines.</p>

<p>The likeliest candidate for new hardware (if there is any) is a new version of the company’s fully wireless earbuds &#8212; which the company has <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/">accidentally leaked out once or twice</a>. The Pixel Buds A are said to sport faster pairing, and if their name is any indication, will be a budget entry.</p>

<p>Speaking of which&#8230; earlier this year, Google made the rather unorthodox announcement confirming that the Pixel 5a 5G is on the way. Denying rumors that have been swirling around the Pixel line generally, the company told TechCrunch in a statement, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.” Given that the 4a arrived in August, we could well be jumping the gun here. Taken as a broader summer time frame, however, it’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility here.</p>

<p>Wear OS has felt like an also-ran basically for forever. Rebrands, revamps and endless hardware partners have done little to change that fact. But keep in mind, this is going to be Google’s first major event since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">closing the Fitbit acquisition</a>, so it seems like a no-brainer that the company’s going to want to come on strong with its wearable/fitness play. And hey, just this week, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/12/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-expansion-report/">rumor broke</a> that Samsung might be embracing the operating system after years of customizing Tizen.</p>
<p>Things kick off Tuesday morning <strong>May 18 at 10 a.m. PT, 1 p.m. ET</strong> with a big keynote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 million fundraise earlier this year</a>, payments giant <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> has been on an acquisition march to continue building out its business. In the latest development, the company has acquired <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, a startup based in Oakland that has built a platform to automatically run card authentications and detect fraud in card-based online transactions. Its technology is tailored for mobile transactions and includes a flow to help users authenticate themselves if they are mistakenly flagged, to come back into an app legitimately (hence the name).</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but Stripe is acquiring both Bouncer&#8217;s technology and the team, which will be integrated into Stripe Radar. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/stripe-debuts-radar-anti-fraud-ai-tools-for-big-businesses-says-it-has-halted-4b-in-fraud-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Started in 2018</a>, Radar is Stripe&#8217;s AI-based anti-fraud technology toolset, and most of the tech &#8212; which is focused around preventing fraudulent transactions on the Stripe platform &#8212; has been built in-house up to now. Stripe says that Radar already prevents &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud for businesses&#8221; each year.</p>
<p>“Bouncer is a great tool for modern internet businesses. It allows them to quickly identify stolen cards, while also ensuring legitimate customers can transact without being blocked,” said Simon Arscott, business lead for Stripe Radar, in a statement. “We’re thrilled to welcome the Bouncer team, and their years of experience building payment authentication software for businesses, to Stripe and to enable their technology for Radar users. With the addition of advanced card scanning capabilities, Stripe Radar will be able block more fraud and further increase revenue for millions of businesses around the world who rely on Stripe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal comes a couple of weeks after Stripe announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of TaxJar</a> to bring cloud-based sales tax calculating tools into its payments platform.</p>

<p>Like Stripe itself, Bouncer was incubated at Y Combinator, in its case as part of its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bouncer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer 2019 cohort</a>. In addition to YC, it had raised funding from Commerce Ventures and the Pioneer Fund, but had never disclosed how much it had raised in total.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Polish marketing technology startup <a href="https://www.usebouncer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a>, which provides bulk email verification, Oakland Bouncer was co-founded by Will Megson (CEO) and Sam King (chief scientist), who between them have an interesting pedigree when it comes to identity verification, from academia to working at fast-scaling companies in categories that have been some of the biggest adopters of verification technology.</p>
<p>Both previously worked for years at on-demand transportation service Lyft in fraud, identity and payment management. Before that, Megson was at Groupon; and King, in addition to holding a position as an associate professor of computer science at UC Davis, worked at Twitter on account security, founding the fake accounts team.</p>
<p>Groupon is among the customers that Bouncer currently works with, alongside OfferUp, ibotta and Dealerware. Bouncer will keep its current service and customers up post-deal.</p>
<p>Radar is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/pricing#radar-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently sold in a number of tiers</a>, ranging from free to 6p per screened transaction, depending on how it is being used (there is a more basic machine learning tier, and an enhanced tier for fraud teams, and the price varies also depending on whether customers are using Stripe&#8217;s standard pricing fees or something else). Stripe also offers a chargeback protection service priced at 0.4% per transaction, as well as analytics tools for Radar customers to get an overview of what is going on.</p>
<p>Stripe says that Radar has blocked more than $1 billion in fraudulent transactions since it was launched.</p>
<p>Bouncer is also <a href="https://www.getbouncer.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently priced at different tiers</a>, ranging from free to $.15/scan for its basic solution, or a custom price for its more tailored services.</p>
<p>Integrating Bouncer&#8217;s card scanning and risk technology into the Radar stack will both sweeten the deal for people to buy those services from Stripe, but also make the tools more effective.</p>
<p>As Stripe describes it, when Radar flags a transaction, Bouncer&#8217;s card screening and verification technology will kick in as a &#8220;dynamic intervention&#8221; to confirm whether or not a customer had a legitimate card at the time of the transaction. This is done to help reduce false positives, which are more frequent in high-risk transactions (such as those for big-ticket items, or if a person has been making several transactions in quick succession, or other payment activity that just comes up as unusual in systems).</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been in a wave of new authentication technology that includes things like biometrics and other innovations, but Bouncer takes an approach that is less high-tech at the point of ingestion &#8212; needing only a phone&#8217;s camera and the card that the customer is using. When a transaction is flagged up and sent to Bouncer for verification, Bouncer works by requesting a picture of the payment card (which can be based on any payment card type and can be a low-light picture).</p>
<p>It then runs that through its PCI- and GDPR-compliant system to see if it&#8217;s stolen or real. If it&#8217;s real, the transaction continues; stolen and the transaction is cancelled. The whole process can take less than a second (not including the time it takes you to take a picture, of course).</p>
<p>For Bouncer, the idea is that Stripe&#8217;s machine learning engine will in turn help Bouncer become more effective.</p>
<p>“I’m excited that we’ll be able to scale our advanced card-verification technology across the Stripe network to help businesses grow their revenue while further reducing fraud behind the scenes,” said Will Megson, CEO of Bouncer, in a statement. “The same signals that Radar learns from will make Bouncer more effective, and Bouncer will, in turn, make Radar more effective. We couldn’t be more excited to join the Radar team.”</p>
<p>Stripe has made a number of acquisitions over the years to bring in key pieces of technology, and in one case &#8212; when it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayStack in Lagos</a> (another YC alum) &#8212; to help Stripe enter and serve merchants in Africa and more emerging markets overall.</p>

<p>At least two of these have been made in aid of bringing on technologists and technology to build out its compliance and authentication tools. In <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/stripe-acquires-teapot--3c1237bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Stripe quietly acquired Teapot</a>, a Silicon Valley startup that had been working on APIs for identity verification, trust, credit and other tools needed in financial transactions. Its co-founders spent some years at the company before moving on to other things.</p>
<p>In 2019, Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/stripe-acquires-touchtech-updates-apis-to-prep-for-strong-customer-authentication-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a startup out of Ireland called Touchtech</a> to bring in technology to prepare for Strong Customer Authentication regulations in Europe.</p>
<p>The need for better, more sophisticated tools to ensure online transactions are legit is not going anywhere fast. Malicious hacking &#8212; and the consequences that has for obtaining personal data that can be used in consumer fraud &#8212; continues to be a persistent threat. And in the meantime, e-commerce continues to become an ever-more mainstream activity, widening the pool of consumers and the chances of things going wrong.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of noise out there. The ability to effectively communicate can make or break your launch. It will play a role in determining who wins a new space &#8212; you or a competitor.</p>
<p>Most people get that. I get emails every week from companies coming out of stealth mode, wanting to make a splash. Or from a Series B company that’s been around for a while and hopes to improve their branding/messaging/positioning so that a new upstart doesn&#8217;t eat their lunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You have to stop thinking that what you are up to is interesting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>How do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?</p>
<p>Worth noting is that my area of expertise is in the DevOps space and that slant may crop up occasionally. But these five specific tips should be applicable to virtually any startup.</p>
<h2>Leverage your founders</h2>
<p>This is especially important if you are a small startup that not many people know about. Journalists don’t want to hear opinions from your head of marketing or product &#8212; they want to hear from the founders. What problems are they solving? What unique opinions do they have about the market? These are insights that mean the most coming from the people that started the company. So if you don’t have at least one founder that can dedicate time to being the face, then PR is going to be an uphill battle.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do to support these efforts. Create a list of all the journalists that have written about your competitors. Read those articles. How can your founder add value to these conversations? Where should you be contributing thought leadership? What are the most interesting perspectives you can offer to those audiences?</p>
<p>This is legwork and research you can do before looping founders into the conversation. Getting your PR going can be like trying to push a broken-down car up the road: If the founders see you exerting effort to get things moving on your own, they&#8217;re more likely to get beside you and help.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: It may be unreasonable to ask a founder to sit down and write a 1,000-word thought leadership piece by the end of the week, but they very likely have 20 minutes to chat, especially if you make it clear that the contents of the conversation will make for great thought leadership pieces, social media posts, etc.</p>
<p>The flow looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You</em> come up with topic ideas based on research.</li>
<li>The founder picks their favorite.</li>
<li>You and the founder schedule a 20-minute chat to get their thoughts on paper.</li>
<li><em>You</em> write up the content based on those thoughts.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has failed in its bid to prevent its lead EU data protection regulator from pushing ahead with a decision on whether to order suspension of its EU-U.S. data flows.</p>
<p>The Irish High Court has just issued a <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/High%20Court%20Judgement%202021-05-14.pdf">ruling</a> dismissing the company&#8217;s challenge to the Irish Data Protection Commission&#8217;s (DPC) procedures.</p>
<p>The case has huge potential operational significance for Facebook, which may be forced to store European users&#8217; data locally if it&#8217;s ordered to stop taking their information to the U.S. for processing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">September </a>the Irish data watchdog made a preliminary order warning Facebook it may have to suspend EU-U.S. data flows. Facebook responded by filing for a judicial review and obtaining a stay on the DPC&#8217;s procedure. That block is now being unblocked.</p>
<p>We understand the involved parties have been given a few days to read the High Court judgement ahead of another hearing on Thursday &#8212; when the court is expected to formally lift Facebook&#8217;s stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation (and settle the matter of case costs).</p>
<p>The DPC declined to comment on today&#8217;s ruling in any detail &#8212; or on the timeline for making a decision on Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows &#8212; but deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us it &#8220;welcomes today’s judgment&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook told it may have to suspend EU data transfers after Schrems II ruling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/embed/#?secret=pMTvicyeM3" data-secret="pMTvicyeM3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its preliminary suspension order last fall followed a landmark judgement by Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">in the summer</a> &#8212; when the CJEU struck down a flagship transatlantic agreement on data flows, on the grounds that U.S. mass surveillance is incompatible with the EU&#8217;s data protection regime.</p>
<p>The fall-out from the CJEU&#8217;s invalidation of Privacy Shield (as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">an earlier ruling striking down its predecessor Safe Harbor</a>) has been ongoing for years &#8212; as companies that rely on shifting EU users&#8217; data to the U.S. for processing have had to scramble to find valid legal alternatives.</p>
<p>While the CJEU did not outright ban data transfers out of the EU, it made it crystal clear that data protection agencies must step in and suspend international data flows if they suspect EU data is at risk. And EU to U.S. data flows were signalled as at clear risk given the court simultaneously struck down Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The problem for some businesses is therefore that there may <em>simply</em> <em>not be</em> a valid legal alternative. And that&#8217;s where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">things look particularly sticky for Facebook</a>, since its service falls under NSA surveillance via Section 702 of the FISA (which is used to authorize mass surveillance programs like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/07/ecj-ag-prism-opinion/">Prism</a>).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>So what happens now for Facebook, following the Irish High Court ruling?</p>
<p>As ever in this complex legal saga &#8212; which has been going on in various forms since an original 2013 complaint made by European privacy campaigner Max Schrems &#8212; there&#8217;s still some track left to run.</p>
<p>After this unblocking the DPC will have two enquiries in train: Both the original one, related to Schrems&#8217; complaint, and an own volition enquiry it decided to open last year &#8212; when it said it was pausing investigation of Schrems&#8217; original complaint.</p>
<p>Schrems, via his privacy not-for-profit noyb, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-eu-us-data-transfer-complaint-schrems-gets-a-judicial-review-of-the-irish-dpcs-procedure/">filed for his own judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s proceedings</a>. And the DPC quickly agreed to <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-05/Settelement%20-%20DPC%20-%20Schrems.pdf">settle</a> &#8212; agreeing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">January</a> that it would &#8220;swiftly&#8221; finalize Schrems&#8217; original complaint. So things were already moving.</p>
<p>The tl;dr of all that is this: The last of the bungs which have been used to delay regulatory action in Ireland over Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows are finally being extracted &#8212; and the DPC must decide on the complaint.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, the clock is ticking for Facebook&#8217;s EU-U.S. data flows. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">expect another wordy blog post from Nick Clegg very soon</a>.</p>
<p>Schrems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">previously told TechCrunch</a> he expects the DPC to issue a suspension order against Facebook within months &#8212; perhaps as soon as this summer (and failing that by fall).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/">Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech companies, we see through your flimsy privacy promises&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/tech-companies-we-see-through-your-flimsy-privacy-promises/embed/#?secret=Nz3q3sgbyu" data-secret="Nz3q3sgbyu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement reacting to the Court ruling today he reiterated that position, saying: &#8220;After eight years, the DPC is now required to stop Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers, likely before summer. Now we simply have two procedures instead of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Ireland (finally) decides it won&#8217;t mark the end of the regulatory procedures, though.</p>
<p>A decision by the DPC on Facebook&#8217;s transfers would need to go to the other EU DPAs for review &#8212; and if there&#8217;s disagreement there (as seems highly likely, given what&#8217;s happened with draft DPC GDPR decisions) it will trigger a further delay (weeks to months) as the European Data Protection Board seeks consensus.</p>
<p>If a majority of EU DPAs can&#8217;t agree the Board may itself have to cast a deciding vote. So that could extend the timeline around any suspension order. But an end to the process is, at long last, in sight.</p>
<p>And, well, if a critical mass of domestic pressure is <em>ever</em> going to build for pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance laws now looks like a really good time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We now expect the DPC to issue a decision to stop Facebook&#8217;s data transfers before summer,&#8221; added Schrems. &#8220;This would require Facebook to store most data from Europe locally, to ensure that Facebook USA does not have access to European data. The other option would be for the US to change its surveillance laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment on the Irish High Court ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company has now sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s ruling was about the process the IDPC followed. The larger issue of how data can move around the world remains of significant importance to thousands of European and American businesses that connect customers, friends, family and employees across the Atlantic. Like other companies, we have followed European rules and rely on Standard Contractual Clauses, and appropriate data safeguards, to provide a global service and connect people, businesses and charities. We look forward to defending our compliance to the IDPC, as their preliminary decision could be damaging not only to Facebook, but also to users and other businesses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you’re head-down and nose to the grindstone — I’m looking at all you hard-working early-stage startup founders — it’s easy to miss a deadline for an outstanding opportunity. Case in point: competing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September.</p>
<p>We want every game-changing, innovative startup — from anywhere around the world — to have a shot at massive exposure to investors, media and other influential unicorn-makers. The $100,000 in equity-free prizemoney would be nice, too, right? That’s why we’re extending our application deadline for another full week.</p>
<p>It won’t cost you a thing to apply or to participate, so don’t let this trajectory-changing opportunity slip past you. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TechCrunch editorial team will vet every application and ultimately choose roughly 20 startups to go head-to-head. Each team receives weeks of free, rigorous coaching from our seasoned Battlefield team. Your pitch, presentation skills and business model will reach new heights of excellence. You’ll also be ready to deftly handle all the questions you’ll receive from our expert VC judges.</p>
<p>Startup Battlefield plays out over several rounds, with the field progressively narrowing. Each time you make the cut, you’ll repeat your pitch-and-answer session to a new set of judges. All that training, prep and focus leads to a final showdown and one last grab for the brass ring. And then it’s up to the judges to decide which stand-out startup wins the championship and that huge check.</p>

<p>While only one startup wins the money and the title, every team that competes benefits from standing in a global spotlight. Sean Huang, co-founder of Matidor, competed in Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020. His team was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">one of the five finalists</a>. Here’s what he said about his experience:</p>
<p>&#8220;Going through Startup Battlefield helped us simplify and improve our pitch. It helped us not only with brand messaging, but also to win other pitch competitions after Battlefield. By pitching in the finals, we booked a demo with one of the final panelists. We received inbound investment interest from 12 Tier-1 investors, and eight potential key clients came to our website for a demo session. We also received an endorsement letter for our Y Combinator application from a fellow Battlefield participant, with whom we formed a great connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>You’re head down and focused — that’s why we’re giving you a one-week extension. So&#8230; stop, look up and grab this opportunity to take your startup to whole new levels. Get your nose off that grindstone and <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield here</a> before <strong>May 27 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on countless businesses across the globe, the $118 billion gaming industry not only survived, it thrived, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us">55%</a> of American consumers turning to gaming for entertainment, stress relief, relaxation and a connection to the outside world amid lockdowns.</p>
<p>This drove a 20% boost in gaming sales globally and created nearly 20,000 jobs in 2020 alone. And it’s not expected to stop any time soon: According to research company <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/video-games-industry/">IBISWorld</a>, the industry is set to grow again in 2021, adding to the year-over-year growth the industry has seen in the preceding half-decade.</p>
<p>This is great news for the growing gaming industry and especially those looking to score a job at a company developing the next blockbuster. The unemployment rate is <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/employment/video-games-united-states/">already near zero</a> for those with gaming development and design skills, which means there is an unprecedented opportunity to join the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Gamesmith, a digital community dedicated to the gaming industry, currently has more than 5,750 open jobs posted on its site, with roles in design, engineering and animation leading the way. In other words, if you never considered a career in the gaming industry &#8212; or thought that your skill set wouldn’t translate &#8212; this expanding job market needs employees from all types of backgrounds. Chances are one of your interests &#8212; besides gaming, of course &#8212; can act as a conduit into finding a career.</p>
<p>One career path for those with art skills &#8212; particularly with a talent for digital art tools like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop &#8212; is animation. An animator can do any number of jobs at a gaming company or studio, from building immersive landscapes and cities to modeling what a certain character will look like to designing user interfaces and navigational components. There is significant growth here, too: According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005429/en/Global-Animation-VFX-Video-Games-Market-Report-2021-Strategies-Trends-Opportunities-2020-2025---ResearchAndMarkets.com">recent study</a>, most sectors of the animation industry are growing 2% to 3% year over year. According to Gamesmith, the average 30-year-old female artist or animator makes a salary of just under $90,000 a year.</p>
<p>If you’re a whiz with words and witty dialogue, then you might consider applying for a job as a writer at a studio. Writers are responsible for writing everything from the profanity-laced shouts heard in the background in the Grand Theft Auto series to the long speeches in epic adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Employers are looking for writers with a flair for crafting stories and understanding characters, so even if you’re not a career writer, highlight the work you’ve done that fits in the mold of what game publishers are looking for.</p>
<p>One of the most important segments of the industry &#8212; and one of the fastest-growing &#8212; is developing and designing the gaming experiences themselves. The job market for these roles is predicted to grow by 9.3% between 2016 and 2026, <a href="https://www.neit.edu/blog/video-game-designer-job-outlook#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Designing%20is%20one,9.3%25%20between%202016%20and%202026.">according to the New England Institute of Technology</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> and the breadth of jobs in this wing of the industry range from level designers to lead designer and developers.</p>
<p>Gamesmith calculated that these jobs account for 16% of the available openings, but make up only 5% of all applications. While you will need at least a computer science degree and an understanding of the fundamentals of programming to land one of these jobs, the payoff for the time spent hitting the books is worth it. Gamesmith estimates that the average 28-year-old male engineer earns a salary north of $100,000.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any of these skills to help design a game from the ground up, there are still plenty of ways to break into the industry. No matter how good a game is, it will only be a success if people know about it, so the marketing and promotions teams at studios play a crucial role in making sure that consumers purchase the latest release and that it gets written about. If you have great communication skills and can work through people’s problems, companies always need customer service representatives.</p>
<p>Across all sectors of the gaming world, companies are looking to diversify their workforce and move away from an image as a job sector solely populated by white men in their early to mid-30s. Gamesmith research found that currently 74% of the industry’s workforce is male and 64% is white.</p>
<p>But that is changing. While in 2020, only 24% of studios invested moderate resources into diversity initiatives, out of those studios that did invest those resources, 96% reported at least moderately successful results and improvements to company culture. It may seem slow, but there does seem to be a recognition that the gaming industry needs a more diverse workforce as a way not just to bring more equity to their offices, but to make better games in the future and make the industry look more like the people who play games.</p>
<p>“Diversity isn’t a nicety; it’s a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people who play games every day in this country,” said Jo Twist, the CEO of the U.K.-based gaming trade association Ukie. “A diverse industry that draws on myriad cultures, lifestyles and experiences will lead to more creative and inclusive games that capture the imagination of players and drive our sector forward.”</p>
<p>Between the push to diversify the industry and a slew of new opportunities in the field, the key takeaway is that there are a wide range of possible careers in the industry and, even if you don’t think they do, your skills probably translate into one of the many roles that a gaming company needs to fill. Avid gamers know that you’re not going to beat a game the first time you turn on your console. So hone your skills, build up your experience and continue your quest to land a job in the industry of your dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last call, y’all. Today’s the final day to keep more money in your pocket and still enjoy three opportunity-packed days at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. Our super early-bird price — $99 — disappears <strong>tonight, May 14 at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Get your click on, avoid the price hike and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass right here, right now</a>. Unless, of course, you enjoy paying more than necessary. Hey, we don’t judge.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about just some of the reasons why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TC Disrupt</a> ranks as the must-attend event for anyone within the early-stage startup ecosystem. Connection is key to growth, and you’ll connect with thousands of attendees from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An all-virtual Disrupt means you can build relationships and collaborate with Silicon Valley movers and shakers no matter where Google Map pins you. And you never know where in the world you might find the perfect partner or eager investor.</p>
<p>Networking at Disrupt is practically an Olympic sport, and now you have two ways to make those vital connections. First up, here’s what Ada Lau, the manager of market development at Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, had to say about networking on the fly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The virtual platform’s chat feature made it easy to connect with participants. People got creative using it to promote their business, like posting a LinkedIn profile or offering 15-minute time slots to review business pitches. I even saw a product-naming competition. You could find lots of opportunity rolling through the chat area.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to target people based on shared business goals, you’ll love CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform. Answer a few quick questions during registration, and you can schedule one-on-one meetings with the people who can help you move forward — pitch investors, demo products, interview tech talent, build important relationships.</p>
<p>Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, shared this about her networking experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>CrunchMatch made networking easy. We sent quick introductions, scheduled meetings with investors and other smart people who could add value to our company. A person we connected with at Disrupt is currently helping us with marketing, which is fantastic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond networking, you’ll find plenty of possibilities in our expo area. Hundreds of early-stage startups in the Startup Alley ready to showcase their tech products, services and platforms.</p>
<p>You won’t want to miss any of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">incredible speakers</a>, interviews, presentations and panel discussions — and thanks to the combination of livestreaming and video-on-demand with your complementary three-month Extra Crunch membership, you can catch them all at your convenience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, but today is the last day you can attend all three days for less than $100. Don’t miss out on serious savings. Stop what you’re doing right now and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass your TC Disrupt 2021</a>. The deadline expires tonight, <strong>May 14 at 11:59 p.m. (PT).</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Similar to how telehealth faced declines as patients returned to in-person care, edtech will face similar drops as schools become a safer option for students and teachers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years in the backwaters of venture capital, edtech had a booming 2020. Not only did its products become must-haves after schools around the globe went remote, but investors also poured capital into leading projects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">There was even some exit activity</a>, with well-known edtech players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/">Coursera going public</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>But despite a rush of private capital &#8212; which has continued into this year, as we’ll demonstrate &#8212; edtech stocks have taken a hammering in recent weeks. So while venture capitalists and other startup investors are pumping more capital into the space in hopes of future outsize returns, the stock market is signaling that things might be heading in the other direction.</p>
<p>Who’s right? One investor that The Exchange spoke to noted that market turbulence is just that, and that he’s tuning into activity but not yet changing his investment strategy. At the same time, the recent volatility is worth tracking in case it&#8217;s a preview of edtech&#8217;s slowdown.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the changing value of edtech stocks in recent months, parse some preliminary data via <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> that provides a good feel for the directional momentum of edtech venture capital, and try to see if there’s irrational exuberance among private investors.</p>
<p>You could argue that it’s public investors who are suffering from irrational pessimism and that private-market investors have the right of it. But since public markets price private markets, we tend to listen to them. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Falling shares</h2>
<p>We’re sure that you want to get into the private-market data, so we’ll be brief in describing the public-market carnage. What follows is a digest of edtech stocks and their declines from recent highs:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Compared to its 52-week high, <strong>Chegg</strong> stock has lost over a third of its value.</li>
<li aria-level="1">After reaching $62.53 per share in April, <strong>Coursera</strong> has shed about half of its value and is trading close to its $33 IPO price.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>2U</strong> closed at $33.92 per share yesterday, its shares also losing half of their value compared to their 52-week high.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Staying on that theme, <strong>Stride</strong> (K12) closed at $26.77 per share yesterday, which is about half of its 52-week high.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> has been busy on the acquisition front this week, and today the company announced it was buying threat assessment platform <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/">Kenna Security</a>, the third company it has purchased this week. The two companies did not disclose the purchase price.</p>
<p>With Kenna, Cisco gets a startup that uses machine learning to sort through the massive pile of threat data that comes into a security system on a daily basis and prioritizes the threats most likely to do the most damage. That could be a very useful tool these days when threats abound and it&#8217;s not always easy to know where to put your limited security resources. Cisco plans to take that technology and integrate into its SecureX platform.</p>
<p>Gee Rittenhouse, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s Security Business Group, <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/364250">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the deal with Kenna that his company is getting a product that brings together Cisco&#8217;s existing threat management capabilities with Kenna&#8217;s risk-based vulnerability management skills.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is why we are pleased to announce our intent to acquire Kenna Security, Inc., a recognized leader in risk-based vulnerability prioritization with over 14 million assets protected and over 12.7 billion managed vulnerabilities. Using data science and real-world threat intelligence, it has a proven ability to bring data in from a multi-vendor environment and provide a comprehensive view of IT vulnerability risk,&#8221; Rittenhouse wrote in the blog post.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;12 top cybersecurity VCs discuss investing, valuations and no-go zones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/cybersecurity-vc-survey-investing-valuations/embed/#?secret=1O23h7hKUe" data-secret="1O23h7hKUe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The security sphere has been complex for a long time, but with employees moving to work from home because of COVID, it became even more pronounced in the last year. In a world where the threat landscape changes quickly, having a tool that prioritizes what to look at first in its arsenal could be very useful.</p>
<p>Kenna Security CEO Karim Toubba gave a typical executive argument for being acquired: it gives him a much bigger market under Cisco than his company could have built alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our opportunity to change the industry: once the acquisition is complete, we will be one step closer to delivering Kenna’s pioneering Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM) platform to the more than 7,000 customers using Cisco SecureX today. This single action exponentially increases the impact Kenna’s technology will have on the way the world secures networks, endpoints and infrastructures,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/blog/evolving-vulnerability-management-cisco-announces-intent-to-acquire-kenna-security/">in the company blog</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2010, claims to be the pioneer in the RBVM space. It raised over $98 million on a $320 million post-money valuation, according to PitchBook data. Customers include HSBC, Royal Bank of Canada, Mattel and Quest Diagnostics.</p>
<p>For those customers, the product will cease to be standalone at some point as the companies work together to integrate Kenna technology into the SecureX platform. When that is complete, the standalone customers will have to purchase the Cisco solution to continue using the Kenna tech.</p>
<p>Cisco has had a busy week on the acquisition front. It announced its intent to acquire <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/sedona-systems.html">Sedona Systems</a> on Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/cisco-to-acquire-indy-startup-socio-to-bring-hybrid-events-to-webex/">Socio Labs on Wednesday</a> and this announcement today. That&#8217;s a lot of activity for any company in a single week. The deal is expected to close in Cisco Q4 FY 2021. Kenna’s 170 employees will be joining the Security Business Group led by Rittenhouse.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The fully vaxxed and officially fully immune took over the podcast this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> co-hosting the show while the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> is out from Shot No. 2. <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris, </a>as always, were behind the scenes making sure we sound pretty and don&#8217;t fall down too many punny board game rabbit holes after vacation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown of what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/05/13/tesla-and-ethereum-billionaires-spark-shock-300-billion-crypto-price-crash-as-bitcoin-and-dogecoin-suddenly-plummet/?sh=35c7582f34f6">Crypto crashed &#8212;</a> thanks to either<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/elon-musk-bitcoin-crash-tesla-cryptocurrency-b1846650.html"> Elon</a> or the guy who created Ethereum and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/">donated some to relief efforts for COVID-19. </a>We debated how signals gets lost and rediscovered and lost again in this news cycle, and what that means for anyone in tech trying to get a pulse of what&#8217;s actually happening.</li>
<li>One symptom of market craze and disconnected booms? A startup named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/">Caplight that wants more people to buy and sell short positions on private startups. </a></li>
<li>We then pivoted into the last bit of our &#8220;The World Is Melting&#8221; section to talk about home ownership and the slow stink of real estate stocks right now. On top of that, Better.com, a digital mortgage lender, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">decided to SPAC</a> after reportedly tabling an IPO.</li>
<li>A mention of SPACs obviously opened up a can of worms, or should I say, oasis of woods.</li>
<li>The world might be melting, but SoftBank could be having the last word. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/softbank-joins-top-corporate-earners-with-its-37-billion-vision-fund-profit.html">The Japanese conglomerate shut us up</a> with its recent profits &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">proving Danny&#8217;s point in an old EC piece</a><em> (use code EQUITY for a discount).</em></li>
<li>We switched gears and talked about a neat new $20 million fund coming out of the Midwest, Sixty8 Capital, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannegarrett/2021/05/10/the-talent-is-here-black-women-led-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-first-20-million-fund-to-invest-in-underrepresented-midwestern-founders/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">its plan to invest in underrepresented founders</a>.</li>
<li>The show ended as chaotically focused as it began with a round robin of the most interesting funding rounds of the last week, not limited to but including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/blind-raises-37m-to-double-down-on-workplace-gossip-and-career-advice/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Blind&#8217;s $37 million raise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-last-gameboard-raises-4m-to-ship-its-digital-tabletop-gaming-platform/">The Last Gameboard&#8217;s $4 million check</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/just-womens-sports-funding-wnba-uswnt-stars-kevin-durant-2021-5">Just Women&#8217;s Sports</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/morressier-wants-academic-conferences-to-feel-cutting-edge/">Morressier&#8217;s $18 million Series A.   </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While modern machine learning systems act with a semblance of artificial intelligence, the truth is they don&#8217;t &#8220;understand&#8221; any of the data they work with — which in turn means they tend to store even trivial items forever. Facebook researchers have proposed <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-how-to-forget-at-scale">structured forgetfulness</a> as a way for AI to clear the decks a bit, improving their performance and inching that much closer to how a human mind works.</p>
<p>The researchers describe the problem by explaining how humans and AI agents might approach a similar problem.</p>
<p>Say there are 10 doors of various colors. You&#8217;re asked to go through the yellow one, you do so and then a few minutes later have forgotten the colors of the other doors — because it was never important that two were red, one plaid, two walnut, etc., only that they weren&#8217;t yellow and that the one you chose was. Your brain discarded that information almost immediately.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But an AI might very well have kept the colors and locations of the other nine doors in its memory. That&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t understand the problem or the data intuitively — so it keeps all the information it used to make its decision.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an issue when you&#8217;re talking about relatively small amounts of data, but machine learning algorithms, especially during training, now routinely handle millions of data points and ingest terabytes of imagery or language. And because they&#8217;re built to constantly compare new data with their accrued knowledge, failing to forget unimportant things means they&#8217;re bogged down by constant references to pointless or outdated data points.</p>
<p>The solution hit upon by Facebook researchers is essentially — and wouldn&#8217;t we all like to have this ability — to tell itself how long it needs to remember a piece of data when it evaluates it to begin with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151984" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151984" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2151984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif" alt="Animation showing 'memories' of an AI disappearing." width="692" height="368" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Each individual memory is associated with a predicted expiration date, and the scale of the memory depends on the task,&#8221; explained Angela Fan, a Facebook AI researcher who <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/not-all-memories-are-created-equal">worked on the Expire-Span paper</a>. &#8220;The amount of time memories are held depends on the needs of the task — it can be for a few steps or until the task is complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in the case of the doors, the colors of the non-yellow doors are plenty important until you find the yellow one. At that point it&#8217;s safe to forget the rest, though of course depending on how many other doors need to be checked, the memory could be held for various amounts of time. (A more realistic example might be forgetting faces that aren&#8217;t the one the system is looking for, once it finds it.)</p>
<p>Analyzing a long piece of text, the memory of certain words or phrases might matter until the end of a sentence, a paragraph or longer — it depends on whether the agent is trying to determine who&#8217;s speaking, what chapter the sentence belongs to or what genre the story is.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/">Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/embed/#?secret=Le7rbbFP18" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This improves performance because at the end, there&#8217;s simply less information for the model to sort through. Because the system doesn&#8217;t know whether the other doors might be important, that information is kept ready at hand, increasing the size and decreasing the speed of the model.</p>
<p>Fan said the models trained using Expire-Span performed better and were more efficient, taking up less memory and compute time. That&#8217;s important during training and testing, which can take up thousands of hours of processing, meaning even a small improvement is considerable, but also at the end user level, where the same task takes less power and happens faster. Suddenly performing an operation on a photo makes sense to do live rather than after the fact.</p>
<p>Though being able to forget does in some ways bring AI processes closer to human cognition, it&#8217;s still nowhere near the intuitive and subtle ways our minds operate. Of course, being able to pick what to remember and how long is a major advantage over those of us for whom those parameters are chosen seemingly randomly.</p>
