<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest big news, chats about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds, and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and don’t forget to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/do-the-celebrities-help-the-startups-or-do-the-startups-help-the-celebrities/">last Thursday’s episode</a> that dug into the impact of celebrity endorsement, and investment.</p>
<p>This morning we had a lot to get through, so here are the headlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks are set to rise as the COVID-19 vaccine is initially rolled out.</li>
<li>Vista Equity Partners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/vista-acquires-it-education-platform-pluralsight-for-3-5b/">will purchase</a> Pluralsight for $3.5 billion. Good news for edtech? Kinda.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/">Reddit is buying Dubsmash</a>, causing us to ask just what the message board unicorn is building.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ea-to-acquire-codemasters-for-1-2-billion/">EA is buying Codemasters</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/appboxo-gets-1-1-million-seed-to-build-a-mini-app-ecosystem-for-all-developers/">Appboxo has raised $1.1 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/edtech-boom-continues-as-intellectokids-raises-3m-from-allrise-capital-and-others/">IntellectoKids has raised $3 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/cledara-the-saas-purchase-and-management-platform-raises-3-4m-funding/">Cledara has raised $3.4 million</a>.</li>
<li>We were also in love with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/german-bionic-raises-20m-led-by-samsung-for-exoskeleton-tech-to-supercharge-human-labor/">this startup&#8217;s funding news</a>.</li>
<li>And, finally, in light of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/technology/roblox-ipo.html">Roblox IPO delay</a>, we wonder who else might be on track to cut loose their 2020 plans for an early 2021 re-jigger. Not that such a delay is really that bad, but with 2021 expected to be a hot year for debuts, kicking off with delays and pricing worries would be a real bummer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn&#8217;t get to the Google story or the huge hack news. So, there&#8217;s more to read if you are so inclined.</p>
<p>And that is the show! Hugs and good vibes from the Equity crew!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Six years ago, Zoox launched quietly with a mighty mission: build and commercialize just about every aspect of a robotaxi service from the self-driving software stack and on-demand ride-sharing app to the management of the fleet and an unconventional vehicle that would transport passengers.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s finally lifting the veil on its multi-year effort. Zoox, which was acquired earlier this year by Amazon, unveiled the electric, autonomous robotaxi it built from the ground-up — a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. The vehicle can drive bidrectionally and has four-wheel steering, capabilities that Zoox said were included to allow it to maneuver through compact spaces and change directions without the need to reverse. In other words, dense urban environments.</p>
<p>The vehicle has a <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">four-seat, face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter. It&#8217;s also equipped with a 133 kilowatt-hour battery that Zoox said allows it to operate for up to </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">16 continuous hours on a single charge. Zoox didn&#8217;t provide a mileage range for the battery. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are other design goodies packed in and around the vehicle, including an airbag system for bidirectional vehicles and carriage seating that envelops passengers. Zoox said this is equal to five-star crash safety protections for all four seats. The vehicle has cameras, radar and lidar that gives it a 270-degree field of view on all four corners of the vehicle, which Zoox said lets it consistently track objects next to and behind it, including pedestrians, bicyclists and other road users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086621" style="width: 2810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086621" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086621 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg" alt="" width="2800" height="1575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle-Interior-day.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086621" class="wp-caption-text">Zoox L5 Fully Autonomous, All-electric Robotaxi Interior</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox CTO Jesse Levinson said building the vehicle from the ground-up gave the company an opportunity to reimagine passenger safety, shifting from reactive to proactive measures. &#8220;These include new safety features such as our airbag design, redundant hardware throughout the vehicle, a unique sensor architecture, and a custom AI stack that detects and mitigates potential risks,&#8221; Levinson said, adding that the vehicle has passed key Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards crash tests.</p>
<p>What is not yet known is if Zoox has received approval by the FMVSS to operate the vehicle. These federal standards require manufacturers to build vehicles with specific features such as steering wheels. The Zoox vehicle doesn&#8217;t have one since it was designed to drive on its own. Earlier this year, autonomous delivery startup Nuro became the first company to receive a driverless exemption from the federal government.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The exemption granted by the the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is for Nuro’s new low-speed electric vehicle called the R2 that will be used for local delivery service for restaurants, grocery stores and other businesses. While Nuro&#8217;s vehicle doesn&#8217;t have a steering wheel either, it&#8217;s also designed just for delivering goods, not people.</p>
<p>Despite this final and important regulatory hurdle, completing the vehicle is a milestone for the company. Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said it marks an important step on the company&#8217;s journey towards deploying an autonomous ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>Zoox is testing the purpose-built vehicle on private roads, and will then move to public roads, the company said in an email exchange. &#8220;This is an important step, as Zoox wants to ensure that the vehicles on the road have been thoroughly tested, vetted, and are ready for the public to use,&#8221; the spokesperson said in the email. &#8220;Zoox is still on their journey on the path of launching a commercial ride-hailing service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox, which operates as an independent subsidiary of Amazon, is currently testing in Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Foster City. The company intends to handle all aspects of the robotaxi service and could eventually expand to delivering packages, according to an interview Evans had with Bloomberg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Long established as a global financial center, Singapore also looks set to become the &#8220;Silicon Valley of Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Tencent, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Alibaba are <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3101542/tencent-said-join-rivals-alibaba-bytedance-picking-singapore-asia-hub">reportedly planning regional hubs</a> in the city-state, with ByteDance in particular <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/tiktok-owner-bytedance-moving-to-bigger-singapore-office-at-one-raffles-quay-amid">expected to add hundreds of jobs over the next three years</a>. They will join an international coterie of tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Stripe, Salesforce and Grab, that already have headquarters or significant operations, including engineering and R&amp;D centers, in Singapore.</p>
<p class="p1">This means startups will have to compete more aggressively for talent. But having a diverse cluster of big tech companies helps the ecosystem by providing more resources, including mentorship and early funding opportunities, say Singapore-based investors. In the long term, the presence of global tech giants, coupled with homegrown unicorns like Grab, Sea (formerly known as Garena) and Trax, may also mean more exit opportunities for startups.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The Singaporean government continues to create new initiatives that make it attractive to tech companies and entrepreneurs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p class="p1">While the United States-China trade war may have prompted Chinese companies like Tencent and ByteDance to move more of their operations to Singapore, it’s not the only reason, said AppWorks partner Jessica Liu, who oversees the venture firm and accelerator’s programs in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Many already had investments in Southeast Asian companies and were eyeing markets there as well, particularly Indonesia. &#8220;Some of it is probably due to the trade war over the past two years and other difficulties they’ve faced in the States,&#8221; she told Extra Crunch. &#8220;Strategically, they also have to find another big market with long-term potential for growth, and I think that’s why they are targeting Southeast Asia.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p1">Government policy pays off</h2>
<p class="p1">Proximity to important growth markets isn&#8217;t the only reason tech companies find Singapore desirable. Regulations also play a role. Liu said, &#8220;The Singaporean government has already done a good job, from a policy and tax perspective, for startups and big tech companies to set up and incorporate in Singapore,&#8221; making the country an &#8220;intuitive&#8221; choice for regional headquarters.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of what makes Singapore attractive to tech companies today can be credited to government initiatives that have been in play for more than a decade, said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner at early-stage investment firm Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p class="p1">Before Monk’s Hill Ventures, Lim served as chief executive officer of Infocomm Investments from 2010 to 2013. Infocomm Investments is backed by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore, a government agency that is responsible for promoting the IT industry in Singapore.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;One of its explicit mandates was to look at bringing in top-tier tech companies to set up shop in Singapore, and ideally focus on product development activities, in addition to marketing activities like sales,&#8221; said Lim. &#8220;That’s always been a very explicit part of the government’s strategy to grow the tech industry.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Over the past few years, companies like Google and Facebook have set up substantial operations in Singapore, along with fast-growing startups like Twilio, which came in after receiving investment from Infocomm.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;That strategy has been in play for almost 10 years, even longer, and I think we’re seeing the fruits of that now, with ByteDance, as well as Tencent, et cetera,&#8221; Lim said. &#8220;In terms of impact, I would say in general it has been very positive in terms of the vibrancy of the ecosystem, bringing in more depth of talent across multiple functional areas and bringing more richness in the different types of players across different verticals.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Other factors made Singapore an attractive base for tech companies, including the fact it is a primarily English-speaking country, has a large number of international schools and was already filled with other multinational companies.</p>
<p class="p1">Timing was also crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Between 2010 and 2020, Southeast Asia went through a sea change, a lot of mobile first, which made it more meaningful for companies to set up local operations,&#8221; said Lim. &#8220;All those dovetailed nicely during that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Singaporean government continues to create new initiatives that make it attractive to tech companies and entrepreneurs. For example, it recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/singapores-government-launches-blockchain-innovation-program-with-8-9-million-in-funding/"> launched the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme (SBIP)</a>, with the aim of helping companies commercialize blockchain technology.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Competing for the same talent pool</h2>
<p class="p1">All this means that the pool of tech talent in Singapore, which has a population of 5.6 million, is in especially high demand. Moving teams of employees to Singapore can be expensive, said Liu, and as a result, many companies have satellite engineering teams in Vietnam, India and Taiwan, especially for front-end engineers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise recruiting company <a href="https://www.icims.com">iCIMS</a> is announcing that it has acquired <a href="https://www.altrulabs.com">Altru</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/icims" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="icims">iCIMS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> declined to comment on the terms of the deal, but a source with knowledge of the companies told us that the price is a combination of cash and stock, totaling around $60 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, iCIMS offers a &#8220;talent cloud&#8221; used by more than 4,000 employers attract, engage and hire new employees, and to help existing employees continue to develop their careers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Former Marketo chief executive Steve Lucas <a href="https://www.icims.com/company/newsroom/icims-names-steve-lucas-chief-executive-officer/">became CEO in February</a>, and he told me that that the recruiting world is overdue for reinvention. After all, every company says they want to hire the most talented people around, so he wondered, &#8220;Well, okay, if you want that, why do you create such boring content? Why do you take a job that is exciting and should demand amazing human beings and create this super boring job description?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucas sees video as a key piece of the solution, allowing companies to bring more &#8220;authenticity&#8221; to what can be a stuffy and bureaucratic process. Just over a month ago, iCIMS announced another acquisition in this area — <a href="https://www.easyrecrue.com/en/hr-news/icims-acquires-easyrecrue">Paris-based Easyrecrue</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NGuvA4pY8L"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/">Altru raises $1.3M to improve recruiting with employee videos</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Altru raises $1.3M to improve recruiting with employee videos&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/embed/#?secret=NGuvA4pY8L" data-secret="NGuvA4pY8L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lucas said that while Easyrecrue has created tools to enrich video interviews, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/altru" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="altru">Altru <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can be most helpful earlier in the recruiting process, when companies are trying to stay connected with the most promising candidates and get them excited about a potential job.</p>
<p>Altru CEO Alykhan Rehmatullah (who founded the startup with CTO Vincent Polidoro — they&#8217;re both pictured above) told me that while the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/altru-funding/">started out with a focus on recording and sharing employee videos for recruitment</a>, its asynchronous videos are become used more broadly across companies. He suggested that&#8217;s particularly true this year,  while teams are working from home and everyone&#8217;s looking for ways to communicate that are more expressive than Slack and don&#8217;t require putting &#8220;another 30-minute Zoom call on your calendar.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Lucas said that before talking to me, he&#8217;d actually been recording videos on Altru to explain the acquisition to his own team. He praised the platform&#8217;s ease of use, joking, &#8220;If I can use this thing, anybody can use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rehmatullah said the entire Altru team will be joining iCIMS, where he&#8217;ll become vice president of content strategy. The goal is to continue operating Altru as a standalone product while also finding new ways to integrate it into the iCIMS platform.</p>
<p>Altru previously raised a total of $1.3 million from Birchmere Ventures, Active Capital and Techstars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://madewithcollab.com/">Collab</a>, Facebook&#8217;s experimental app for making collaborative music videos, is today launching out of private beta testing with a public release <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473">on the App Store</a>. The app is one of now many projects from Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, which tests out new ideas that could ultimately influence Facebook&#8217;s next steps in social media. Collab itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">first emerged in late May,</a> as the pandemic forced users to stay home and find new ways to entertain themselves online.</p>
<p>For musicians, the pandemic has meant the lack of live concerts, which had been a key way they connected with fans. They, too, turned to online platforms to experiment with live-streamed concerts and jam sessions in order to keep those connections flowing. At the same time, short-form videos took off, led by TikTok, which also includes collaborative features like duets and stitches, which allow users who don&#8217;t know each other to incorporate each other&#8217;s content into their own.</p>
<p>Collab stepped into this space with its combination of short-form video and the collaborative aspects of modern social media, but with a direct focus on music.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the app, a &#8220;collab&#8221; is a selection of three 15-second long independent videos, stacked on top of each other, that play in sync. For example, a collab could consist of a guitarist, drummer and a singer, each playing alongside each other in their respective videos. Users can either create a collab by playing along with someone else&#8217;s video or, if you lack musical experience, you can just swipe on one of the three rows to choose a different video to slot into the mix from those available.</p>
<p>When you first open Collab, you&#8217;re presented with an endless scrolling feed of these &#8220;collabs,&#8221; which you can swipe through to find one you want to join or mix. As you discover musicians you like to play along with, you can favorite them in the app to be notified when they post new clips. This also personalizes the main feed.</p>
<p>Indie pop artist morgxn is one of the musicians who joined Collab during the beta earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, I was dropped by my record label the same day that Billie Eilish [<a href="https://popcravenews.com/37-songs-that-inspired-billie-eilishs-wwafa-wdwg/">posted</a>] about me &#8212; about my song &#8216;Home&#8217; being inspiring to her song &#8216;Bad Guy.&#8217; So I had this catastrophic thing happening as we were entering quarantine, while the internet was giving me this boost of confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgxn decided to release <a href="https://we.tl/t-0Atc0rRGNh">his song &#8220;Wonder&#8221; on Collab</a>, asking fans to come make a video with him by playing along. That song now has 43 million streams. There&#8217;s even a Spanish-language version, thanks to Collab.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything came from this year where everything kind of fell apart, I also was really inspired to find new ways to do everything,&#8221; morgxn says. &#8220;If you leap, you might find something incredibly exciting, new and fresh. That&#8217;s how I ended up on Collab, and I&#8217;m excited.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="width: 886px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2086572-1" width="886" height="1920" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RemixV5__Final.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<p>During the beta, Facebook made improvements to the app&#8217;s audio syncing capabilities and other technical aspects.</p>
<p>The app itself will handle the complexities of audio and video syncing by offering in-app tools that can nudge your clip back into alignment when you&#8217;re off, so the resulting &#8220;collab&#8221; will be perfectly synced. Facebook also tested Collab with dozens of headsets and hardware configurations to optimize Collab for a variety of different setups. Users can now even use external audio interfaces to bring music from electronic instruments, like keyboard, guitars, and drum kits into their recordings.</p>
<p>The app doesn&#8217;t offer a direct integration to Facebook, but the company notes that musicians are often using their bio to post links to their various social media presences, which may include their Facebook or Instagram profiles or pages. However, the videos you create in Collab can be exported to other places through the iOS share share, meaning you can publish to your Instagram Story or even to rival TikTok. The export will be watermarked to allow for attribution as the video is more widely distributed, too.</p>
<p>The mechanics in Collab could allow for different types of mashed up videos in the future &#8212; like videos that include dance or humor, for instance, which have made an appearance during the beta. But for the time being, Facebook is remaining focused on music, says Collab Product Lead, Brittany Mennuti.</p>

<p>Mennuti, who had studied both Fine Arts and Business while in college, leads a small team inside Facebook with other creatives, including artists and musicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that I had to get really embedded in the community of musicians and music enthusiasts to build this product &#8212; and that&#8217;s exactly what we did. We created a Facebook group for our beta testers, and we communicate with them in that group daily, she says. In the group, musicians post questions, suggestion and share their music. &#8220;Aside from helping us figure out their needs, the most beautiful thing about this group is that they&#8217;ve actually connected with one another &#8212; there&#8217;s like a real community blossoming within the beta of people who might not have ever made music together.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it goes public, Facebook&#8217;s goal for Collab is to carve out a niche in the short-form video space that offers something more than a TikTok clone, like Instagram&#8217;s Reels or Snap&#8217;s Spotlight. However, to what extent Collab would live on independently, if it succeeded, rather than being merged into one of Facebook&#8217;s larger products remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Collab is live in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473">App Store in the U.S.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/general-catalysts-katherine-boyle-and-peter-boyce-are-looking-for-obsessive-founders/">General Catalyst&#8217;s Peter Boyce explained</a> how one of the most important things he looks for in a founder is a personal connection to the problem they&#8217;re solving. <a href="http://www.katewestervelt.com/">Kate Westervelt</a> is one such founder.</p>
<p>Westervelt founded <a href="https://www.mom-box.com/">Mombox</a>, a curated kit of postnatal care products focused squarely on the mom rather than the child. The company recently closed a $500k angel round led by Wayfund and TBD Angels, as well as high net-worth individuals from organizations like Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and Drizly.</p>
<p>Westervelt first came up with the idea for Mombox after having her first child and quickly learning that there were several products she&#8217;d need to help her body heal that were difficult to find, especially with a newborn on her hip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086609" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086609" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg 4667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mombox-2043.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086609" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mombox</p></div>The standard Mombox includes organic overnight pads, a peri bottle, perineal ice pack, post-pregnancy panties, and other care products to help soothe the body and mind. Mombox also offers a C-section box and a Deluxe Mombox.</p>
<p>For now, the Mombox is a one-time kit — Westervelt said the vast majority of kits are purchased as gifts — but the company has plans to build out the product to include a kit subscription, content, and a platform to connect new moms with the care providers they may need during the first year of motherhood. Westervelt calls it a 24/7 pocket concierge, which would allow new mothers to ask questions and get connected with lactation consultants, pelvic floor therapists, marital therapists or whomever else they might need during their first year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The myth here, created by a male dominated medical and maternal wellness community, is that postpartum recovery is six to eight weeks long,&#8221; said Westervelt. &#8220;The truth is that the body goes through a process known as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/motherhood-unfiltered/201904/matrescence-the-developmental-transition-motherhood">matrescence</a>, similar to adolescence, where the body and hormones and identity is changing, and that process lasts at least 12 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on to say that there is usually just one check-up with a doctor after giving birth and after that, the mom is on her own. Mombox aims to stay with mom for the first 12 months of motherhood and eventually personalize the Mombox experience based on each mom&#8217;s journey, whether its breastfeeding or bottle, stay-at-home or working mom, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest challenge is that the narrative has always been to put the child&#8217;s care first,&#8221; said Westervelt. &#8220;Mothers are willing to martyr themselves for the care of this infant at the expense of their own wellbeing. The challenge is to teach moms that they&#8217;re the nucleus. If they&#8217;re ok, their babies are ok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westervelt bootstrapped Mombox up until this point (and is the only employee) after first serving as Managing Lifestyle Editor at Wayfair and then as Director of Content Strategy at Purple Carrot. Mombox has spent $0 on marketing up until this point, growing revenue 100 percent year-over-year since inception on word of mouth.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward hiring out a team and testing out new marketing strategies to fuel further growth and eventually build out the full-service platform Westervelt envisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not nearly on the same scale as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gmail-youtube-google-docs-and-other-services-go-down-simultaneously-in-multiple-countries/?tpcc=ECTW2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google&#8217;s outage earlier today</a>, but it turns out that Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook email service has been having problems, too.</p>
<p>Readers are reporting to us, and an update on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> site status for its various Office services <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirms</a>, that some Outlook users may not be able to sign in and use their email on Outlook.com because of a glitch in its Active Directory infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is not clear how many users are affected but it is definitely not all of them. (I logged in with no problem to my account here in England.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="ng-scope">
<div>
<p class="ng-binding ng-scope">&#8220;We believe that a section of infrastructure within our Active Directory (AD) systems is causing impact,&#8221; engineers wrote in a post for Outlook services on its <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status update page</a> that&#8217;s been up for at least an hour now. &#8220;We&#8217;re analyzing the errors being generated to help us confirm this.&#8221; The page indicates that other services like Skype, OneDrive and Teams are all working fine.</p>
<p>While Google&#8217;s outage appeared total but started to get fixed seemingly as suddenly as it arrived (the total outage lasted for around an hour, all told), Microsoft&#8217;s issues appear to have been ongoing for at least six hours, but possibly even longer in terms of reported incidents, according to <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DownDetector</a> statistics. The site noted that most of the issues, over 80%, were at login.</p>
</div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook, which is in essence a combination of its Outlook desktop and web email service with its legacy Hotmail web-only product and has become a central way for consumers to log into all of Microsoft&#8217;s web-based services, was a clear early mover in the world of web-based (and thus cloud-based) email, a market that it used to dominate.</p>
<p>However, the launch of Google&#8217;s Gmail hit a chord with users who liked its fast speed, pared-down interface, and general success in weeding out junk and spam, and it soon overtook its older competitor. In 2019, Outlook was estimated to have about 400 million users, compared to the 1.5 billion or so accounts on Gmail.</p>
<p>That still doesn&#8217;t mean an outage doesn&#8217;t have an impact. Microsoft&#8217;s last outage that affected multiple services was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/microsoft-login-office-outlook-teams-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September</a>, when Outlook, Teams and Office were among the services that crashed due to an authentication glitch. Coincidentally, some believe that authentication is at the heart of Google&#8217;s problems today.</p>
<p>The incidents at Google and Microsoft will undoubtedly get resolved, but they still highlight a critical issue.</p>
<p>They underscore some of the fragility &#8212; and ultimate precariousness &#8212; of having so much of our communications, our data, and our lives tied up in a handful of proprietary cloud-based networks. When they go down, especially at a time when we are living in a virtual way more than ever before because of the health pandemic, the consequences are felt ever more heavily.</p>
<div>
<p>We have contacted Microsoft for comment and will update this post as we learn more.</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given all of the…feedback <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has received, it’s hard to believe the Halo wasn’t widely available until today. Announced in late-August, the product has been offered in “early access” to invited users. That changes today, however, as the product opens to everyone in the U.S.</p>
<p>The band runs $100, a price that includes six months of membership. It was probably inevitable that the company would launch a fitness product, though Amazon’s behind the curve as far as form factors go. Smartwatches have become a dominant force in fitness tracking on the high end. Bands are still a presence on the opposite side of the market, but generally command a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>What makes the Halo different is its use of voice and the amount of data it collects and processes – neither are honestly a surprise, coming Amazon. The former involves processing the wearer’s tone of voice, which has drawn some…mixed feedback. Here’s how Amazon describes that bit,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Tone of voice analysis can help you communicate more thoughtfully with family, friends, colleagues, your favorite food truck proprietor, and everyone in between.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-better-measure-of-health">Body fat scanning</a> is an even bigger question mark. Early reviews have called the technology “invasive,” among other things. It has also drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Senator Amy Klobuchar penned a letter to Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“While new wearable fitness devices make it easier for people to monitor their own health, these devices give companies unprecedented access to personal and private data with limited oversight,”<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/5/35297230-1088-4728-80a6-6a8cd1108a9a/2B62F5B3B4E2A4E04A16A9D01759FF38.121120healthprivacyletter.pdf"> Klobuchar wrote</a>. “More must be done to ensure the privacy and security of health-related consumer devices.”</p>
<p>Amazon has actively pushed back on privacy concerns, highlighting, among other things, that the body scans exist only on the device used to capture them. “Privacy is foundational to how we designed and built Amazon Halo,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/11/amazon-halo-klobuchar-privacy/">told The Washington Post</a>. “Body and Tone are both optional features that are not required to use the product.”</p>
<p>Amazon’s got the dually difficult task of assuring consumer privacy and attempting to set the product apart in a well-saturated market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m glistening. My heart rate is finally slowing a bit as I type this. The slightest hints of my asthma are subsiding. I’m not going to tell you I feel “good,” as relative as that term might be in a year when everything has gone to hell somehow both gradually and all at once over the course of 12 awful months. But I certainly don’t feel “bad,” either.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a kind of serendipity in today’s launch of Fitness+. While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> gets points for general prescience, one assumes the company wasn’t privy to any better information than the rest of us, and certainly couldn’t have predicted how radical a shift the exercise industry would undergo over the past nine months.</p>
<p>Most of the information on COVID-19’s impact on gyms is, at best, either myopic or anecdotal, but there seems little doubt the industry has been — and will continue to be — radically impacted by the pandemic. “Devastated” might be a more accurate term. After all, it’s mid-December as I’m writing this and many are still scared to venture back into a business that routinely ranks among the highest risk for the virus’s spread. As if people needed another excuse to skip daily workouts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What we can say for certain, however, is that Wall Street and Silicon Valley cultures have reacted, big time. In late-June, Lululemon purchased Mirror for a jaw-dropping $500 million. Shortly after, Bank of America started tossing out predictions, noting the guided workout company could generate $700 million and hit 600,000 subscribers by 2023. Peloton stock hit a slight blip with Apple’s Fitness+ launch announcement last week, but otherwise, it’s a been a terrific year from the home treadmill/stationary bike maker.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/embed/#?secret=iynft2r4KZ" data-secret="iynft2r4KZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>None of this is to say, of course, that these companies weren’t already doing gangbusters, but the pandemic has certainly — in the words of an overzealous fitness instructor — kicked it up a notch. Yes, I grimaced a bit as I wrote that last sentence, but ultimately, what is a fitness class if not an exercise in swallowing one’s pride?</p>
<p>My own experience with group workouts is limited. Prior to the pandemic, I went to the gym five to seven days a week. When on a work trip, I would be the weirdo at the hotel gym, trying to figure out how to change the one giant-tube television from Fox News at 6AM. I don’t care what your political leanings are — no Fox and Friends for me before coffee and a run.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, my options have been…limited. In addition to the harrowing COVID fallout in my home of Queens in March/April, I dealt with some of my own health complications that severely limited my workout options. I’ve weaned myself back into a kind of makeshift workout regimen in the intervening few months — first through some YouTube yoga and now through five to 15-mile daily walks.</p>
<p>It’s an improvement. And I’m counting my blessings and all of that, knowing well that as bad as things had and have gotten, they ultimately could be worse. Truth is, though, like many Americans (and non-Americans, no doubt), the cost-benefit analysis of going back to the gym still doesn’t make a heck of a lot of sense for me. Given the space constraints of my New York City apartment, however, neither does a Peloton.</p>
<p>I do, however, have an Apple Watch. And a yoga mat. And just about enough space in my bedroom to make this work. I’ve been at this for a few days — doing a couple of workouts a day, ranging from about 10 to 20 minutes a piece. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/daily-crunch-first-impressions-of-the-airpods-max/">Matthew did last week with his AirPods Max</a> writeup, I’m going to opt not to call this a “review.” It’s not fair to the product and — more to the point — it’s not fair to you, the reader.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086564" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>What I can say definitely, however, is that I do plan to continue using the service beyond these first few days. Perhaps that’s a testament to the product&#8217;s potential. Or maybe it’s just a sign that I’m looking for a way to stop feeling like a wet garbage bag full of room temperature cottage cheese all of the time. The truth, as usual, probably lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Fitness — like anything health related — is a highly personal thing. There has never and likely will never be a kind of one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of working out. And while Fitness+ is the latest, shiny attempt to tackle the issue, that’s certainly the case here as well. The best I can do for you right now is discuss my own personal needs and experiences. Some will likely sound familiar, others not.</p>
<p>My biggest fitness hurdles are: time and space. The time bit should be self-explanatory — and familiar to most. Even during a year-long quarantine, there’s somehow never enough of the stuff. Space is mostly — but not entirely — a side effect of my decision to live in New York City on a journalist’s salary.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of variety. Once I find something I like at a particular restaurant, I will continue to order it until I’m sick of it. And that likely won’t be for a while. That’s usually the case with how I work out as well (likely to the detriment of my overall health). Once I discovered that I could tolerate running (and keep the pounds off doing it), I ran until I messed up both of knees.</p>
<p>As I said above, walking long distances across bridges and into different boroughs has been a small but important respite for me during hell year. In doing that, I’ve pretty consistently closed my Apple Watch rings (&#8220;Stand&#8221; can still be a stickler on work days). But while I generally don’t have an issue hitting those goals, switching up how I can get there has been something of a challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086567" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086567" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086567" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086567" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Fitness+ does offer some key benefits right off the bat. The first — and arguably most important — is convenience. For $10 a month, you get whatever peace of mind comes with knowing that every Monday, Apple is going to drop a new crop of new workout videos for you every week. That content can be accessed across a number of Apple devices. Namely: the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.</p>
<p>Another thing you should probably know about me (you’re learning all sorts of fun stuff today, right?) is that I’m one of those no TV weirdos, and therefore my own experiences are limited to the iPad and iPhone. There are a number of reasons to go for the Apple TV in this setup, but the most important of all, to be honest, is sheer screen real estate. I found the iPad Air’s 11-inch display was totally acceptable in close range, however.</p>
<p>The iPhone was a lot trickier, on the other hand, when it comes to following the trainers. The upshot of both of these, however, is flexibility. That’s a nice feature when it comes to moving between standing and sitting exercises. The other big upshot will come when we all start traveling again. I can certainly see the appeal of busting out one or two of these workouts in my hotel room, instead of gambling that the elliptical machine will be up and running (about 50/50 in my experience).</p>
<p>For now, at least, Fitness+ doesn’t have its own standalone app. Like other premium services before it, Apple’s snuck it into an update of an existing app — a move that ensures the new paid offering is instantly available on millions of devices starting today. In the iPhone app, it appears as one of three tabs. It always felt a little superfluous to have individual apps for Fitness, Health and Watch, but I suppose that now we know why they’ve kept those things separate. Today also marks the arrival of the standard Fitness app for iPadOS, where Fitness+ is more or less the entire experience.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch is required for the Fitness+ experience. There’s apparently a way to circumvent things if, say, you accidentally forgot your Watch at home or your battery dies or what have you. But on the whole, no watch, no Fitness+. Ecosystem’s gonna ecosystem, friend.</p>
<p>The necessity for this particular piece of hardware makes sense when you consider how deeply integrated it is. The Watch really is the core of the Fitness+ experience. It does its usual job collecting your metrics, which are now also displayed for you in real time on screen as you work out. The primary information at the ready is how far you are into the activity bar and your heart rate — the latter in particular seems like an important piece of information for many. And it is pretty fascinating to watch your numbers climb and drop between intervals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086570" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Honestly, the Apple Watch integration is probably the best-executed aspect of the entire undertaking — down to the way the wearable doubles as a start and stop button for the workout. It also ensures a more complete rundown of your workouts at the end of the day. The truth of a wrist-worn monitor — whether Apple wants to admit it or not — is that it can be hit or miss with full body workouts.</p>
<p>That’s a big part of the reason why the device asks you to start or confirm workout types during normal usage. Give the current sensor technology available for these products, there’s a limit to how precisely you can measure movement. If you’re wearing the Watch and doing pre-selected Fitness+ workouts, on the other hand, the system is able to offer a more complete picture. Collected data is also aggregated into a “Burn Bar,” which will show you roughly where you rank compared to others who have done the exercises (I generally found myself somewhere in the middle). This can be toggled off if you’re not feeling competitive.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s really not much in the way of gamification here. The closest Apple’s hand-selected trainers come is the fairly regular encouragement to “close your rings.” It’s tough to strike the balance of motivating without overwhelming. Go too far in either direction and you risk losing people. I’d say on the whole Apple does a decent job striking the balance, down to the fact that there are often three trainers in the videos, each showing you a different level of intensity for the on-screen exercises.</p>
<p>One key thing Apple does lose here, versus both in-person fitness classes and live-streamed ones from the likes of Peloton, is instant feedback. The company has positioned its “on-demand” approach as a way of letting users complete courses at their own pace. In a more ideal world, however, there would be some combination of the two. Apple certainly has the resources to do both — though there’s a fair bit more that goes into live-streaming with real-time bio feedback.</p>
<p>If I had to venture a guess here, I would say that in all likelihood Apple will add live classes at some point. There’s value in having a set appointment you feel obligated to attend. And for all of the Fitness+ trainers’ encouragement that “you’re doing great,” let’s be real: they’re speaking to a camera in a studio for a video that was recorded days — if not weeks — ago.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW I’M DOING!</p>
<p>The variety of exercises on offer is pretty good. I’ve mostly been alternating between Core and HIIT (high intensity interval training). Given that it’s all right there in front of me, I have found myself trying some new stuff. Turns out I still hate dancing in basically all of its forms — but it’s nice to check in every decade or so. The biggest limitation for me (beyond those outlined above) is equipment.</p>
<p>I don’t have a stationary bike or treadmill. I have a kettlebell, but not a complete weight set. I do have a yoga mat, however, which is probably the most common piece of equipment here. Honestly, if you’re thinking of trying Fitness+, I would shell out $25 for a yoga mat. Turns out you can still use it even if you cancel your account. There’s a small description letting you know what equipment is needed below the video. It would be great if Apple added an easie way to filter by equipment, though, given the percentage of workouts that require something.</p>
<p>Ditto for music. Apple really prides itself on the music choices here (and the trainers seems encourage to talk a lot about it). In fact, each course includes an Apple Music playlist of the song choices (ecosystems for the win). I recognize that music choices are every bit as personal as fitness needs, so I know I’m not speaking for everyone when I say the music is, on a whole, mostly bad. As you’d expect.</p>
<p>There are exceptions for different trainers and different exercises, but the selections I mostly encountered in my workouts are more or less the same sort of high energy Top 40 crap you’ve probably already encountered at your gym. If that’s your thing, cool. If not, you’re going to find the alternatives fewer and farther between. I would love if Apple eventually adds an option to toggle off the music or replace it with your own stuff. You can filter by genre within a given exercise category, but for obvious reasons, that&#8217;s going to limit the workout selections in the process.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed a course, a small checkmark will show up in the corner. It sticks around, which is nice if you find something you like, but it would be great if the app more dynamically cycled through things and offered quick reference for what you’ve already done. Again, this is all coming from someone who’s done six or so workouts over three or so days. The app adds customization the more you use it, and I just haven’t been using it long enough.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086571" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086571" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086571" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The overall execution is about as polished as you’d expect from an Apple production, down to the fact that the trainers were taught some sign language for greetings and goodbyes (in addition to closed captioning). Money has been spent on production value and hiring a diverse group of trainers. And certainly you’re getting more consistent quality here than you would just perusing YouTube for random exercises.</p>
<p>Is it worth $10 a month (or $80 a year), though? My main hesitation on that front is that it’s yet another in a seemingly endless pile of monthly fees from the ever-growing subscription economy. It’s significantly cheaper than a gym, obviously. Though the equipment here is very much bring your own, in the case of Apple, and the Watch doesn’t take the place of in-person feedback from classes or even the kind offered on some of the full-body fitness mirrors.</p>
<p>Like I said at the top I plan to keep using the app for the timing being. I’m still wary of the gym and am generally averse to working out in front of others. And thankfully, I live on the first floor, so none of my neighbors are any the wiser about all of the weird jumping around I’ve been doing lately (though my rabbit finds it amusing).</p>
<p>Here in the States, at least, it seems a safe bet we’ve got at least another four, maybe five months of this pandemic left to deal with. For Apple, that means a solid opportunity to get people on board with its new service. For me, it probably means at least that much more time doing squats in front of an iPad &#8212; especially as we&#8217;re heading into some truly cold months here on the eastern seaboard. I&#8217;ll probably check in my progress in a few weeks or months and maybe feel more comfortable calling it a proper review.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> attempted a test flight of its SpaceShipTwo Unity spaceplane on Saturday, but the flight was cut short after the spacecraft detached from its carrier aircraft. A failsafe prevented Unity&#8217;s rocket engines from firing up, because the computer that monitors the rockets somehow lost their connection to the rocket engines themselves, Virgin Galactic revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>The failsafe cut-off meant that both SpaceShipTwo Unity, and the carrier aircraft, along with all pilots on board, returned safely to Earth for a successful landing without incident. But the test flight was meant to go all the way to space, and this would&#8217;ve been a key stage-setting event to clear the way for flying the first actual paying passengers from the company&#8217;s New Mexico spaceport.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has flown to space on two prior occasions, including first in 2018, and then again in 2019. This would&#8217;ve been its first suborbital spaceflight from New Mexico, however, which is a required preparatory step before it can serve commercial customers from it&#8217;s operational base there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic is now conducting post flight analysis and can so far report that the onboard computer which monitors the propulsion system lost connection, triggering a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor,&#8221; Virgin <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/">shared in a blog post</a> detailing what happened during the test. &#8220;This system, like others on the spaceship, is designed such that it defaults to a safe state whenever power or communication with sensors is lost. The pilots in the spaceship, as well as the engineers and pilots in mission control, are well prepared for any off-nominal results, as they plan and rehearse many potential scenarios during pre-flight simulation practice sessions, including a scenario where the rocket motor does not ignite after release from the mothership.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is obviously not an ideal outcome for the publicly-traded space tourism company, and the market&#8217;s response reflects public investor disappointment. Virgin Galactic&#8217;s CEO Michael Colglazer explained that this test&#8217;s conclusion, while far from nominal, shows that its safety measures are working as designed. He added that they&#8217;ll be continuing to progress with their test flight program, albeit with a re-do of this one before continuing on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The hectic M&amp;A cycle we have seen throughout 2020 continued this weekend when <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> announced it was acquiring  <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> for $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>That comes out to $20.26 per share. The company stock closed on Friday at $18.50 per share on a market cap of over $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pluralsight" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pluralsight">Pluralsight, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vista gets an online training company that helps educate IT professionals including developers, operations, data and security with a suite of online courses. As the pandemic has taken hold, it has breathed new life into EdTech, but even before that, there was a market for upskilling IT Pros online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This trend certainly didn&#8217;t escape Monti Saroya, co-head of the Vista Flagship Fund and senior managing director at Vista. &#8220;We have seen firsthand that the demand for skilled software engineers continues to outstrip supply, and we expect this trend to persist as we move into a hybrid online-offline world across all industries and interactions, with business leaders recognizing that technological innovation is critical to business success,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

<p>As is typical for acquired companies, Pluralsight CEO Aaron Skonnard sees this as a way to grow the company more quickly. &#8220;The global Vista ecosystem of leading enterprise software companies provides significant resources and institutional knowledge that will open doors and help fuel our growth. We’re thrilled that we will be able to leverage Vista’s expertise to further strengthen our market leading position,&#8221; Skonnard said in a statement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/a-chat-with-pluralsight-founder-aaron-skonnard-on-the-global-move-to-sharpen-tech-skills-through-online-training/">a 2017 interview</a> with TechCrunch&#8217;s Sarah Buhr, Skonnard described the company as an enterprise SaaS learning platform. It goes beyond simply offering the courses by giving professionals in a given category such as developer or IT operations the ability to measure their skills and abilities agains other pros in that category. He saw this assessment capability as a big differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform is ultimately focused on closing the technology skills gap throughout the world,&#8221; Skonnard told Buhr.</p>
<p>Pluralsight, which was founded in 2004, raised over $190 million before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/pluralsight-prices-its-ipo-at-15-per-share-raising-over-300m/">going public in 2018</a>. The company has 1700 employees and over 17,000 customers. The acquisition is subject to standard regular regulatory oversight, but is expected to close in the first half of next year. Once that happens, the company will go private once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update</strong>: It looks like various <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1338484637459509249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">services</a> are<a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> starting to come back again</a>, but with some glitches (such as the address bar in Gmail not working correctly). Google has not replied to our request for a comment but a few minutes ago it posted the following on its <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cloud Twitter account, citing an authentication system outage due to &#8220;an internal storage quota issue.&#8221; Full statement here:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, at 3.47AM PT Google experienced an authentication system outage for approximately 45 minutes due to an internal storage quota issue. This was resolved at 4:32AM PT, and all services are now restored.</p>
<p>&mdash; Google Cloud (@googlecloud) <a href="https://twitter.com/googlecloud/status/1338493015145504770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In all, it looks like a huge range of Google services were down for about an hour today. That hour that crossed into business operation times in multiple markets, leading to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slight drop in pre-market trading</a> for parent company Alphabet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also an alarming reminder of just how far Google reaches, and how many of our services &#8212; productivity, entertainment, and home/utility &#8212; are tied up with a single, proprietary provider.<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;"> Coincidentally, Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/microsofts-outlook-also-faces-intermittent-outage-amid-crash-across-multiple-google-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiencing some problems, too</a>.</span></p>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Not much more to update yet but we&#8217;re seeing and getting word from others that multiple Google services have gone down. Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Docs, Maps, Adwords and Adsense, Google Pay, Google Home, Nest and Google&#8217;s Chromecast are all experiencing outages, with dozens, even hundreds, of reports we&#8217;ve seen so far coming in from across Europe, the US, Canada, India, South Africa, countries in Central and South America, Australia and likely more.</p>
<p>Downtime site indicators are <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/gmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing big spikes</a> for services dropping starting from around 11.30AM UK time.</p>
<p>Google.com itself appears to still be working, albeit sluggishly. Ditto Chrome.</p>
<p>Some have surmised that it&#8217;s an issue with <a href="http://account.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Accounts</a> &#8212; which is also not working &#8212; or a wider authentication issue. When everything was down, even if you tried to use Google services incognito they were not working.</p>
<p>So far we aren&#8217;t seeing any explanations for what is going on &#8212; please get in touch if you know something, I&#8217;m on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and I also read direct messages and replies. <del>No point in emailing me!</del></p>
<p>Mainly, though, it&#8217;s an unprecedented failure for a system that has grown to be one of biggest traffic and activity drivers on the internet with billions of users across Google&#8217;s different properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everybody thought the deal was done — Take-Two was supposed to acquire <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/codemasters" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="codemasters">Codemasters <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005649/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reaches-Agreement-for-Recommended-Acquisition-of-Codemasters-Group-Holdings-PLC/">nearly $1 billion</a>. Take-Two even reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters. But Electronic Arts crashed the party at the last minute and offered even more money. EA now plans to buy Codemasters for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Sky News <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/games-giant-electronic-arts-gatecrashes-725m-codemasters-takeover-12160582">originally reported</a> that EA was planning a knockout bid. Since then, EA has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201213005036/en/">officially announced</a> that it has reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Codemasters, the British game studio has been around since 1986, making it one of the oldest game studio still operating today. It has developed and published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Codemasters_video_games">dozens of games</a>. In recent years, the company has been focused on racing games across multiple franchises, such as Dirt, Dirt Rally, Formula One, Grid and (of course) Micro Machines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EA is offering to buy Codemasters for £6.04 per share ($7.98) in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>EA has had a tumultuous relationship with racing games. It has created the Need for Speed franchise, which is one of the most popular racing franchises. But is has also neglected racing games in recent years, which led to disappointing games.</p>
<p>Similarly, EA has acquired Criterion Games in 2004 — the game studio behind Burnout games. But Criterion Games now mostly work as a secondary studio on Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront games.</p>
<p>Codemasters will be able to take advantage of EA’s distribution resources, including <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play/">EA Play</a>, EA’s subscription service. It positions EA Play as an interesting subscription if you care about racing games.</p>
<p>Take-Two probably didn’t expect to lose the deal, but the company is going to be fine. Take-Two owns Rockstar Games (GTA, Red Dead), Firaxis Games (Xcom, Civilization), 2K Sports (NBA 2K) and a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive#Company_structure">other studios</a>.</p>
<p>2020 has been an important year of video game consolidation. Microsoft has been leading this trend with the acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-set-to-acquire-bethesda-parent-zenimax-for-7-5b/">ZeniMax Media</a>, the parent company of Bethesda, id Software and Arkane. Microsoft also acquired Double Fine Productions, Obsidian Entertainment and Ninja Theory in the past couple of years.</p>

<p>The platform offers parents of preschool children ‘gamified&#8217; educational content and structured lessons available on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The startup will now launch a Classroom feature with learning tracks in five core Kindergarten and Grade 1 courses, including Math, Phonics, Science, Arts, and Logic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the current B2C model, the founders expect in 2021 to offer primary schools and kindergartens IntellectoKids’ platform as an online supplement to support their offline educational process.</p>
<p>IntellectoKids was founded by Mike Kotlov and Andrey Kondratyuk in 2017, who each have three young children.</p>
<p>Kotlov said: &#8220;On the education scene, preschool education is becoming a highly vibrant market. The pandemic showed that preschool kids can effectively consume educational content online and autonomously. Clearly, there is a growing need for this type of product among parents and businesses now; however, once the pandemic is over the online education is here to stay for sure as it has already become intertwined with offline and benefited the overall educational process.”</p>
<p>IntellectoKids says it has more than 2 million installs across North America and Central &amp; Northern Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exoskeleton technology has been one of the more interesting developments in the world of robotics: instead of building machines that replace humans altogether, build hardware that humans can wear to supercharge their abilities. Today, <a href="https://www.germanbionic.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German Bionic</a>, one of the startups designing exoskeletons specifically aimed at industrial and physical applications &#8212; it describes its Cray X robot as &#8220;the world’s first connected exoskeleton for industrial use,&#8221; that is, to help people lifting and working with heavy objects with more power, precision and safety &#8212; is announcing a funding round that underscores the opportunity ahead.</p>
<p>The Augsburg, Germany-based company has raised $20 million, funding that it plans to use to continue building out its business, as well as its technology, both in terms of the hardware and the cloud-based software platform, German Bionic IO, that works with the exoskeletons to optimize them and help them &#8220;learn&#8221; to work better.</p>
<p>The Cray X currently can compensate up to 30 kg for each lifting movement, the company says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“With our groundbreaking robotic technology that combines human work with the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), we literally strengthen the shop floor workers’ backs in an immediate and sustainable way. Measurable data underscores that this ultimately increases productivity and the efficiency of the work done,” says Armin G. Schmidt, CEO of German Bionic, in a statement. “The market for smart human-machine systems is huge and we are now perfectly positioned to take a major share and substantially improve numerous working lives.”</p>
<p>The Series A is being co-led by Samsung Catalyst Fund, a strategic investment arm from the hardware giant, and German investor MIG AG, one of the original backers of BioNtech, the breakthrough company that&#8217;s developed the first Covid-19 vaccine to be rolled out globally.</p>
<p>Storm Ventures, Benhamou Global Ventures (founded and led by Eric Benhamou, who was the founding CEO of Palm and before that the CEO of 3com), and IT Farm all also participated. Previously, German Bionic had only raised $3.5 million in seed funding (with IT Farm, Atlantic Labs, and individual investors participating).</p>
<p>German Bionic&#8217;s rise comes at an interesting moment in terms of how automation and cloud technology are sweeping the world of work. When people talk about the next generation of industrial work, the focus is usually on more automation and the rise of robots to replace humans in different stages of production.</p>
<p>But at the same time, some robotics technologists have worked on another idea. Since we&#8217;re still probably still a long way away unable to make robots that are just like humans but better in terms of cognition and all movements, instead, create hardware that doesn&#8217;t replace, but augments, live laborers, to help make them stronger while still being able to retain the reliable and fine-tuned expertise of those humans.</p>
<p>The argument for more automation in industrial settings has taken on a more pointed urgency in recent times, with the rise of the Covid-19 global health pandemic: factories have been one of the focus points for outbreaks, and the tendency has been to reduce physical contact and proximity to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Exoskeletons don&#8217;t really address that aspect of Covid-19 &#8212; even if you might require less of them as a result of using exoskeletons, you still require humans to wear them, after all &#8212; but the general focus that automation has had has brought more attention to the opportunity of using them.</p>
<p>And in any case, even putting the pandemic to one side, we are still a long way away from cost-effective robots that completely replace humans in all situations. So, as we roll out vaccinations and develop a better understanding of how the virus operates, this still means a strong market for the exoskeleton concept, which analysts (quoted by German Bionic) predict could be worth as much as $20 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>In that context, it&#8217;s interesting to consider Samsung as an investor: the company itself, as one of the world&#8217;s leading consumer electronics and industrial electronics providers, is a manufacturing powerhouse in its own right. But it also makes equipment for others to use in their industrial work, both as a direct brand and through subsidiaries like <a href="http://harman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harman</a>. It&#8217;s not clear which of these use cases interests Samsung: whether to use the Cray X in its own manufacturing and logistics work, or whether to become a strategic partner in manufacturing these for others. It could easily be both.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to support German Bionic in its continued development of world-leading exoskeleton technology,” says Young Sohn, Corporate President and Chief Strategy Officer for Samsung Electronics and Chairman of the Board, Harman, in a statement. “Exoskeleton technologies have great promise in enhancing human’s health, wellbeing and productivity. We believe that it can be a transformative technology with mass market potential.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">German Bionic describes its Cray X as a &#8220;self-learning power suit&#8221; aimed primarily at reinforcing lifting movements and to safeguard the wearer from making bad calls that could cause injuries. That could apply both to those in factories, or those in warehouses, or even sole trader mechanics working in your local garage. The company is not disclosing a list of customers, except to note that it includes, in the words of a spokesperson, &#8220;a </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">big logistics player, industrial producers and infrastructure hubs.&#8221; One of these, the Stuttgart Airport, is highlighted on its site. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p>“Previously, efficiency gains and health promotion in manual labor were often at odds with one another. German Bionic Systems managed to not only break through this paradigm, but also to make manual labor a part of the digital transformation and elegantly integrate it into the smart factory,” says Michael Motschmann, managing partner with MIG in a statement. “We see immense potential with the company and are particularly happy to be working together with a first-class team of experienced entrepreneurs and engineers.”</p>
<p>Exoskeletons as a concept have been around for over a decade already &#8212; MIT developed its first exoskeleton, aimed to help soldiers carrying heavy loads &#8212; <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/exoskeleton-0919.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2007</a>, but advancements in cloud computing, smaller processors for the hardware itself, and artificial intelligence have really opened up the idea of where and how these might augment humans. In addition to industry, some of the other applications have included helping people with knee injuries (or looking to avoid knee injuries!) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/roam-debuts-a-robotic-exoskeleton-for-skiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ski better</a>, and for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/suitx-is-bringing-down-the-price-of-robotic-exoskeletons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medical purposes</a>, although the recent pandemic <a href="https://www.roamrobotics.com/blog/elevate-covid-19-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has put a strain on some of these use cases</a>, leading to indefinite pauses in production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cledara.com/">Cledara</a>, the SaaS purchase and management platform that helps bring greater viability and control over a company&#8217;s sprawling software subscriptions, has raised $3.4 million in additional funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Nauta Capital, with participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cledara/">existing investor</a> Anthemis. It comes off the back of the startup growing revenues by 20x in 2020 &#8212; including 7x since August, although Cledara isn&#8217;t breaking out specific numbers.</p>
<p>Founded in July 2018 by Cristina Vila, after she experienced the SaaS management problem first-hand while working at London fintech Dopay, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cledara" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cledara">Cledara <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has developed software to let companies track and manage their SaaS usage and spending, including analytics to help understand if it is money well-spent. Vila has since been joined by co-founder and COO Brad van Leeuwen, who was previously an executive at banking platform Railsbank, which is also a Cledara customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another Cledara feature is unlimited virtual debit cards to empower employees and outside teams to purchase appropriate SaaS offerings independently. This includes the option for management to approve every purchase before it happens and access real-time updates on what everyone is buying. Part of Cledara’s revenue comes from interchange fees via said card spend, along with employing a SaaS model itself with paid subscriptions.</p>

<p>Counting over 100 customers overall, other businesses using Cledara include Florence.co.uk, Unmind.com, and Butternut Box. To that end, Cledara claims its customers reduce software spend by up to 30%, while saving “hours” of manual admin work each month on things like chasing SaaS invoices, bookkeeping and “complying with GDPR and outsourcing regulations for regulated fintech”.</p>

<p>The product is available in over 20 countries across Europe, including U.K., France, Ireland, Germany and Spain. Meanwhile, Cledara says it will use the new investment to accelerate product growth and for further international expansion, including plans to enter the U.S.</p>
<p>“The continued acceleration of growth means we really need to grow the team: we&#8217;ve had to slow down customer on-boarding in the past month because of bottlenecks,” says van Leeuwen. “We will be growing the team 4x before mid next year across all parts of the business &#8212; support, success, product, engineering, compliance, marketing and sales. This round brings us the funding to do that, and more”.</p>
<p>More than half of those new hires are likely to be in Barcelona, after Cledara opened a Spain office 4 months ago to ensure it can continue to access talent outside of the U.K. post-Brexit.</p>

<p>The Finnish firm on Monday launched the Nokia PureBook X14 laptop in collaboration with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for the Indian market.</p>
<p>The Nokia PureBook X14, which is priced at Indian rupees 59,990 ($815), features a 14-inch full-HD display and is powered by Intel’s 10th generation quad-core i5 processor with up to 4.2GHz turbo speed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The laptop, which ships pre-installed with Windows 10 Home, sports a 512GB NVMe SSD and 8 GB DD4 RAM. This is the second time Nokia has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/25/nokia-thinking-about-dabbling-in-the-laptop-biz/">explored the laptop category</a>. More than 10 years ago, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/10/review-nokia-booklet-3g/">launched the Booklet 3G</a> &#8212; its first and last netbook.</p>
<p>Other specs of PureBook X14 include: 86% screen-to-body ratio and 178-degree viewing angles, matte black finish, Dolby Atmos-powered speakers, Face Unlock with Windows Hello, Intel UHD 620 Graphics that clocks up to 1.1GHz, Bluetooth 5.1, two USB 3.1 ports, one USB 2.0 port, and one USB Type C port as well as dedicated ports for HDMI and ethernet. The Nokie PureBook X14, which weighs about 1.1kg, will last up to 8 hours on a single charge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086487" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086487" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086487 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="786" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086487" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Nokia / Flipkart</p></div></p>
<p>Flipkart, which has grown its private label and brand ecosystems in recent years, is the design and manufacturing partner for the new laptop. Like it does with Motorola, Flipkart has inked a licensing agreement with the Finnish firm, a representative of Flipkart told TechCrunch. (Think of it as Nokia&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/hmd-raises-100-million-to-bring-even-more-nokia-phones-to-market/">partnership with HMD Global</a> for smartphones.)</p>
<p>The laptop will be exclusively sold through Flipkart in India, which is also the only market for this particular device.</p>
<p>“Launching the Nokia brand into this new product category is testament to our successful collaboration with Flipkart. We are excited to offer consumers in India a Nokia branded laptop which brings innovation to address a gap in the market, as well as the style, performance and reliability that the Nokia brand is known for, said Vipul Mehrotra, VP for Brand Partnerships at Nokia, in a statement.</p>
<p>The Indian laptop market has attracted several new players in recent years, including smartphone giant Xiaomi, which has launched a range of affordable laptops in the country this year. About 3.4 million PCs shipped in India in the quarter that ended in September, delivering a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP46998720">9.2% year-over-year</a> growth, according to marketing research firm IDC. HP, Lenovo, and Dell commanded over 70% of the market in that quarter, IDC estimated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chinese government is moving to curb the power of some of China&#8217;s most influential internet companies. The country&#8217;s top market regulator <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201214_324336.html">announced</a> Monday that it is fining Alibaba and China Literature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/china-literature-makes-stellar-public-debut/">Tencent&#8217;s e-book spinoff</a>, for failing to report their past acquisition deals for clearance.</p>
<p>The cases involve Alibaba&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/alibaba-intime-2-6-billion/">equity investments in major Chinese mall operator Intown</a> and China Literature&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/tencent-spinoff-china-literature-to-buy-new-classics-media-for-2-2b-in-content-consolidation-play/">acquisition of film studio New Classics Media</a>. The firms are each subject to a fine of 500,000 yuan ($76,000), according to the notice. Though a paltry amount compared to the size of the companies&#8217; multi-billion-dollar deals, the penalty is expected to sound an alarm to other industry players, a spokesperson for the market regulator <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201214_324336.html">said</a> at a press conference.</p>

<p>Alibaba has in recent years been expanding into offline retail, in part through aggressive acquisitions. Tencent, which has built up a digital entertainment empire, has similarly invested in outside partners to help broaden its territory.</p>
<p>The companies failed to seek regulatory clearance though neither deal was deemed to be &#8220;excluding or restricting market competition.&#8221; As such, the market authority ordered a fine rather than a breakup in accordance with China&#8217;s anti-trust laws, it said.</p>
<p>China Literature says it is strictly following the regulatory order to work on compliance and clearance requirements. Alibaba cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The merger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/tencent-huya-douyu-merger/">between games streaming giants Huya and Douyu</a>, both Tencent-backed, is also under investigation by the anti-trust regulator.</p>
<p>The Alibaba and China Literature cases mark the first time that China has fined companies structured as &#8220;variable interest entities&#8221; over market concentration violations. The VIE corporate structure is popular among Chinese internet firms for it lets them operate as domestic firms controlled by foreign entities, but the setup is controversial for it has allowed companies to find regulatory loopholes.</p>
<p>The Chinese anti-trust law, which began seeking public comment in January, is currently under revision, the market regulator said at the press event. Last month, the government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">unveiled a set of draft rules</a> specifically targeting monopolistic behavior among internet firms, though regulations are expected to be complicated, as industry experts noted.</p>

Mini-apps, or lightweight apps designed for integration into host apps, allow smartphone users to access several services through one app, saving them data and storage space. They also give host apps more ways to make revenue. But most mini-app ecosystems are currently tied to a specific app or company. <a href="https://appboxo.com/">Appboxo</a>, a Singapore-based startup, wants to make mini-apps more accessible by allowing any developer to turn their app into a &#8220;super app.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/appboxo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="appboxo">Appboxo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today it has closed $1.1 million in seed funding, led by FF APAC Scout, a Founders Fund vehicle; 500 Startups’ Southeast Asia-focused 500 Durians fund; Plug and Play Ventures; and Antler. The new funding will be used on product development and to add more mini-apps to Appboxo’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The startup currently works with about 10 host apps, including Booking.com, Klook and Zalora, and has about 80 mini-apps on its platform. Examples of how host apps have used mini-apps include travel apps that added hotel, restaurant and activities bookings; and mobile wallets that integrated insurance-buying and e-commerce services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Appboxo was founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Kaniyet Rayev and chief technology officer Nursultan Keneshbekov while they were participating in Antler’s Singapore incubator program. Rayev told TechCrunch that the two initially wanted to build an all-in-one travel app, with different travel-related services integrated into one platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we actually started developing it, we realized there is no easy way to plug in third-party services,&#8221; Rayev said. They began thinking of ways for developers to create and offer mini-apps as a plug-and-play solution.</p>

<p>The mini-app economy is currently siloed, with apps or companies like WeChat, ByteDance, Meituan, Paytm, PhonePe, Grab and Go-jek either developing mini-apps for their own use, or running mini-app marketplaces for their users. But last year, the W3C Chinese Web Interest Group started looking at ways to standardize mini-apps. The group, including people from Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Intel, Xiaomi and China Mobile, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">published the first working draft of its white paper</a> in September 2019 about how mini-apps can be created to work across platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really perfect time for us to read that paper, because it was around the time we started our platform,&#8221; said Rayev.</p>
<p>Adding mini-apps can increase engagement because users open apps more frequently if they can access different services through it. It also gives app developers more ways to generate revenue through affiliate partnerships, commissions or transactions fees.</p>
<p>But many native app developers simply don’t have the resources to develop their own mini-apps, too, so Appboxo simplifies the process with an SDK that allows them to integrate any of its platform&#8217;s mini-apps. Another barrier for many app developers is working out business and development partnership deals with mini-apps, so AppBoxo helps guide them through the process, too.</p>
<p>Since Appboxo is based in Singapore, a lot of its current users are in Southeast Asia, and it also plans to target India. While mini-apps are less common in Europe and the United States, where most smartphone owners still use apps with one core offering, Rayev said that is starting to change. For example, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/uber-eats-uber-eats/">announced</a> it was merging its ride-hailing and food delivery service, Uber Eats, into one app last year, while Snap introduced Minis a few months ago.</p>
<p>AppBoxo already has partners in Europe, and &#8220;the whole super app concept is coming to the Western world,&#8221; Rayev added. &#8220;Hopefully we can find some new partners in the rest of the world as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ola" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ola">Ola <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Monday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Tamil Nadu in India to set up what it claims would be the &#8220;world’s largest scooter manufacturing facility&#8221; in the South Indian state as the Indian ride-hailing firm begins a new push with electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The SoftBank-backed Indian ride-hailing firm said it will invest about $327 million in setting up the factory, which it says would create almost 10,000 jobs and have an initial capacity to produce 2 million electric vehicles in a year.</p>
<p>The move comes as Ola plans to launch and expand its two-wheeler electric vehicles in several markets in the next two quarters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ola Electric, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/ola-ev-business-ola-electric-mobility/">spun out of the startup last year</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/ola-electric-acquires-etergo-to-launch-own-line-of-electric-two-wheelers-this-year/">acquired Amsterdam-based Etergo earlier this year</a>. The Dutch has a fleet of scooters that uses swappable, high energy battery that delivers a range of up to 240 km (149 miles). The startup plans to replicate production of similar model of vehicles, the person said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ola launched its two-wheeler business, which like the cabs business sees someone drive a passenger around, in 2016 and has created livelihoods for over 300,000 people in India. One of India&#8217;s most valuable startups, Ola has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/ola-bike-150-cities-towns-india/">big bets on two-wheeler in recent years</a> to expand the reach of its services to smaller cities and towns across the country. (Compared to four-wheeler, two-wheeler and three-wheeler offer a much more affordable ride to customers and zip faster in busy traffic.)</p>
<p>In a statement, Ola said the new factory would improve India’s electric vehicle ecosystem and serve customers in Europe, Asia, and Latin American among other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to announce our plans to set up the world’s largest scooter factory. This is a significant milestone for Ola and a proud moment for our country as we rapidly progress towards realising our vision of moving the world to sustainable mobility solutions across shared and owned mobility. This will be one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world. This factory will showcase India’s skill and talent to produce world class products that will cater to global markets,” said Bhavish Aggarwal, Chairman and Group CEO of Ola, in a statement.</p>
