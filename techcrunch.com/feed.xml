										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of startups remain focused on consumers, knowledge workers and the opportunities to provide services to those that are already operating completely, or at least partially, in digital environments. But today comes news of funding for a startup building a social network for what is probably one of the least digital business sectors of all: independent, small-hold farmers in the developing world.</p>
<p><a href="http://wefarm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wefarm</a>, a social networking platform aimed at independent farmers to help them meet each other, exchange ideas and get advice, and sell or trade equipment and supplies, has raised $11 million funding to continue expanding its business, which now has 2.5 million users.</p>
<p>To put that number and the growth opportunity into some perspective, Wefarm estimates that there are some 400 million small-hold farmers globally, with a large proportion of them in developing markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding, an extension to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Series A</a>, is being led by Octopus Ventures. True Ventures (which led the 2019 round), Rabo Frontier Ventures, LocalGlobe, June Fund and AgFunder also participated. Wefarm has raised $32 million since being founded in 2005.</p>
<p>To date, London-based Wefarm has primarily found traction in countries in East Africa. Its service is available via a website, but most of its users are accessing without any internet use at all, via the company&#8217;s SMS interface. The SMS format has now hosted more than 37 million conversations from farmers engaging in around 400 different types of farming (from livestock or dairy to grains and fruits and vegetables) and $29 million in marketplace sales, the company said.</p>
<p>But rolling out SMS services can be slow, in part because it requires Wefarm to strike local deals with carriers over data usage. (That has also meant that the company has tightly controlled growth: if you go to the site, you&#8217;ll see that you can either join a waitlist or join by way of an invitation from an existing member.)</p>
<p>Kenny Ewan, Wefarm&#8217;s founder and CEO, said this latest tranche of funding in part will be used to roll out an app (currently in beta) that will help it launch in more countries and pick up more farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big step we’re taking is going from SMS a digital, app-based service, which will remove the digital barrier,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We compare it to the shift from sending DVDs in the mail to streaming video online. We feel like the time is right and believe it could take us to the 100 million mark of users.&#8221;</p>
<h2>From pandemics to locust plagues</h2>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s role in helping link up independent farmers &#8212; traditionally and by its nature one of the most analogue of industries &#8212; has taken on an interesting profile particularly in the last year.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a stark light on a number of digital divides in the world, and one of most distinctive has been in the wider world of business. Entrepreneurs, companies and organizations that had digital strategies in place could hit the ground running to adapt to a &#8220;new normal&#8221; with less physical interaction. Those that did not had to scramble to get there to avoid a nosedive in activity.</p>

<p>Wefarm was around for years before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in some regards it has always been championing and giving a digital voice to the underdogs.</p>
<p>The wider agricultural industry &#8212; globally a multi-trillion dollar enterprise, accounting for <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 25% of GDP in some markets</a> &#8212; has undergone some significant digital transformation, but that has been focused on tools and other technology for the agribusiness sector, which includes the giant conglomerates and multinationals like Cargill, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Bayer (Monsanto&#8217;s parent), John Deere and others.</p>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s importance (and often singular presence) as a tool for independent farmers to communicate, trade and generally network with others like them was already playing out before Covid-19. When we covered the company&#8217;s previous raise in 2019 (the first part of its Series A, a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $13 million round</a>) it had already grown to 1.9 million members. And, as it happens, for many of its users, Covid-19 was in some regards the least of their concerns:</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality a lot of people in rural Africa were concerned about the weather, or the effect of a locust plague,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;What we saw was traffic around not Covid, but these topics. They had different preoccupations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the pandemic has had an impact, nevertheless. On the platform itself, as we saw in other e-commerce scenarios, Wefarm emerged as an essential service for trading at a time when in-person meetings were halted. As for Wefarm as a business, Ewan said that it essentially meant that the company&#8217;s country expansion plans had completely halted mainly because business development teams could no longer travel as they had before: another reason why launching an app could be a useful growth tool.</p>
<p>(That lack of travel was also potentially helpful to Wefarm: despite that the company still managed to grow by 600,000 more users, Ewan pointed out, underscoring a clear demand for the service among its target audience.)</p>
<p>Going forward, there are other ways in which Wefarm aims to leverage its user base, its network and the data that it potentially can amass from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the possibility of providing more analytics and data. Our users want that very much,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;We now know more about small scale farmers than any one else, because they talk to us.&#8221; Areas that Wefarm is considering to develop over the next two years are whether it can help provide more insight into more workable business models, pricing models and more data on particular aspects like ripening periods.</p>
<p>“By building a highly engaged community of millions of small-holder farmers, Wefarm has created a powerful platform providing greater access to vital knowledge and information, which allows farmers to unlock greater economic potential from their land,” said Kamran Adle, early stage investor at Octopus Ventures. “In practice that might mean understanding which fertilisers work best, what the market price is for certain goods, or new farming techniques that result in better yields, all of which can make a significant difference to livelihoods. It’s also an enormous market with more than 400 million small-holder farmers globally who collectively spend around $400 billion on farming inputs. There is a huge opportunity for Kenny and the team at Wefarm to achieve incredible scale and we’re excited for the launch of its digital platform which will further accelerate growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based <a href="https://ibex-ai.com/">Ibex Medical Analytics</a>, which has an AI-driven imaging technology to detect cancer cells in biopsies more efficiently, has raised a $38 million Series B financing round led by <a href="https://octopusventures.com/">Octopus Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.83north.com/">83North</a>. Also participating in the round was aMoon, Planven Entrepreneur Ventures and Dell Technologies Capital, the corporate venture arm of Dell Technologies. The company has now raised a total of $52 million since its launch in 2016. Ibex plans to use the investment to further sell into diagnostic labs in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Originally incubated out of the <a href="https://www.kametventures.com/">Kamet Ventures</a> incubator, Ibex’s “Galen” platform mimics the work of a pathologist, allowing them to diagnose cancer more accurately and faster and derive new insights from a biopsy specimen.</p>
<p>Because rates of cancer are on the rise and the medical procedures have become more complex, pathologists have a higher workload. Plus, says Ibex, there is a global shortage of pathologists, which can mean delays to the whole diagnostic process. The company claims pathologists can be 40% more productive using its solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Joseph Mossel, Ibex CEO and Co-founder said: “You can think of it as a pathologist&#8217;s assistant, so it kind of prepares the case in advance, marks the regions of interest, and allows the pathologist to achieve the efficiency gains.”</p>
<p>He said the company has secured the largest pathology network in France, and LD path, which is five pathology labs that service 24 NHS trusts in the UK, among others.</p>
<p>Michael Niddam, of Kamet Ventures said Ibex was an “excellent example of how Kamet works with founders very early on.” Ibex founders Joseph Mossel and Dr. Chaim Linhart had previously joined Kamet as Entrepreneurs in Residence before developing their idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each of the big three cloud vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; has a marketplace where software vendors can sell their wares. It seems like an easy enough proposition to throw your software up there and be done with it, but it turns out that it&#8217;s not quite that simple, requiring a complex set of business and technical tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tackle.io">Tackle</a>, a startup that wants to help ease the process of getting a product onto one of these marketplaces, announced a $35 million Series B today. Andreessen Horowitz led the investment with help from existing investor Bessemer Venture Partners. The company reports it has now raised $48.5 million.</p>
<p>Company founder Dillon Woods says that at previous jobs, he found that it took several months with a couple of engineers dedicated to the task to get a product onto the AWS marketplace, and he noticed that it was a similar set of tasks each time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What I saw [in my previous jobs] was that we were kind of redoing the same work. And I thought everybody out there was probably reinventing the same wheel. And so when I started Tackle, my goal was to create a software platform that would take that time down to one or two days. So it&#8217;s really a no code solution, and it makes it much more of a business decision, rather than this big technical integration project,&#8221; Woods told me.</p>
<p>While you may think it&#8217;s a pretty simple task to put an app on one of these marketplaces, Woods points out that the AWS user guide explaining the ins and outs is a 700 page pdf. He says that it&#8217;s not just the technical complexity of setting up the various API calls to get it connected, there is also the business side of selling in the marketplace, and that requires additional APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not just the initial sale. There could be things later like upgrades, refunds, cancellations &#8212; maybe you need to do overage charges against that same contract. And so there are all of these downstream things that happen that all require API integration, and Tackle takes care of all of that for you,&#8221; Woods explained.</p>
<p>CEO John Jahnke says that the company usually starts with one product in one marketplace, which acts as a kind of proof of concept for the customer, then builds up from there. Once customers see what Tackle can do, they can expand usage.</p>

<p>It seems to be working with the startup reporting that it tripled annual recurring revenue (ARR), although it didn&#8217;t want to share a specific number. It also doubled headcount and the number of customers and was responsible for over $200 million in transactions across the three cloud marketplaces.</p>
<p>Jahnke didn&#8217;t share the exact number of customers, but he said there were currently hundreds on the platform including companies like Snowflake, GitHub, New Relic and PagerDuty.</p>
<p>The company currently has 67 employees spread across 25 states with plans to almost double that by the end of 2021. He says that it&#8217;s essential to put systems in place to build a diverse company now.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we scale through this next 100% increase in headcount is going to define the mix of the company into the future. If we can get this right right now and continue to extend on the foundation for diversity and inclusion that we started and make it a real part of our conversation at some scale, we think we&#8217;ll be set up as we go from 100 employees to 1000 employees over the long period of time to continue to grow and create opportunities for people wherever they are,&#8221; Jahnke said.</p>
<p>Martin Casado, general partner at lead investor a16z, says this type of selling has become essential for businesses and that&#8217;s why he wanted to invest in the company. &#8220;Cloud marketplaces have become a primary channel for selling software quickly and conveniently. Tackle is the leading player for enabling companies to sell software through the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>

This marks YL&#8217;s first return from its third $75 million fund, which it raised in 2017, and the largest return in the firm&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>With this sale, the company&#8217;s third fund still has six portfolio companies remaining. It closed its fourth fund with $120 million in committed capital in the middle of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike YL, which focuses on early-stage companies &#8212; though it also tends to participate in some later-stage rounds &#8212; the investors that are buying its stake specialize in later-stage companies that are often on an IPO path. ICONIQ Growth has invested in the likes of Adyen, CrowdStrike, Datadog and Zoom, for example, and has also regularly partnered with YL Ventures on its later-stage investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition from early-stage to late-stage investors just makes sense as we drive toward IPO, and it allows each investor to focus on what they do best,&#8221; said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO of Axonius. &#8220;We appreciate the guidance and support the <span class="il">YL</span> <span class="il">Ventures</span> team has provided during the early stages of our company and we congratulate them on this successful journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put this sale into perspective for the Silicon Valley- and Tel Aviv-based YL Ventures, it&#8217;s worth noting that it currently manages about $300 million. Its current portfolio includes the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/orca-security-raises-55m-for-its-cloud-native-security-platform/">Orca Security</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hunters-raises-additional-growth-funding-from-snowflake-ventures/">Hunters</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Cycode</a>. This sale is a huge win for the firm.</p>
<p>Its most headline-grabbing exit so far was Twistlock, which was acquired by Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">for $410 million in 2019</a>, but it has also seen exits of its portfolio companies to Microsoft, Proofpoint, CA Technologies and Walmart, among others. The fund participated in Axonius&#8217; $4 million seed round in 2017 up to its $58 Million Series C round a year ago.</p>
<p>It seems like YL Ventures is taking a very pragmatic approach here. It doesn&#8217;t specialize in late-stage firms &#8212; and until recently, Israeli startups always tended to sell long before they got to a late-stage round anyway. And it can generate a nice &#8212; and guaranteed &#8212; return for its own investors, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exit netted $270 million in cash directly to our third fund, which had $75 million total in capital commitments, and this fund still has 6 outstanding portfolio companies remaining,&#8221; Yoav Leitersdorf, YL Ventures&#8217; founder and managing partner, told me. &#8220;Returning multiple times that fund now with a single exit, with the rest of the portfolio companies still there for the upside is the most responsible &#8212; yet highly profitable path &#8212; we could have taken for our fund at this time. And all this while diverting our energies and means more towards our seed-stage companies (where our help is more impactful), and at the same time supporting Axonius by enabling it to bring aboard such excellent late-stage investors as ICONIQ and Alkeon &#8211; a true win-win-win situation for everyone involved!&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that this sale achieved a top-decile return for the firm&#8217;s limited partners and allows it to focus its resources and attention toward the younger companies in its portfolio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based ForSight Robotics announced today that it has raised $10 million for what it has deemed a “mega-seed round.” Led by Eclipse Ventures and Mithril Capital, the round will go toward expanding the company’s headcount and global reach, as it looks to bring its offerings to international markets, pending the sorts of regulatory approvals that go into launching a robotic surgery platform.</p>
<p>The company’s surgical platform is designed specifically for ophthalmological (eye) surgeries &#8212; a category requiring a great deal of precision. It’s also one in great demand. The company <a href="https://bjo.bmj.com/content/104/4/588">cites a recent study</a> from the British Journal of Ophthalmology, putting the number of qualified eye surgeons at around 72 per million people in developed nations and a mere 3.7 surgeons per million in developed countries.</p>
<p>“It’s a proprietary technology that we developed. It includes robotics, visualization and machine learning,” co-founder and CEO Daniel Glozman tells TechCrunch. “Together, this will allow physicians to democratize surgeries. All physicians around the world will be able to perfect this procedure and perform ophthalmic procedures in a more uniform way.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ForSight has an impressive pedigree for an early-stage startup. Notably, Intuitive Surgical and Auris Health co-founder Dr. Fred Moll sits on the company’s the strategic advisory board, along with Mako Surgical&#8217;s Rony Abovitz and Mithril&#8217;s Ajay Royan. Joining them are a half-dozen ophthalmic surgeons rounding out the clinical advisory board.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-medical-and-surgical-robotics/">noted last year</a>, medical and surgical startups have been a hot category for VCs &#8212; particularly in the seed stage, which accounts for about a quarter of total funding. Some 600-700 companies received funding in 2019. ForSight seems to have the pedigree and interest to match. The company’s goal is to offer its technology to a variety of different markets, in order to level the playing field for access to quality eye surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of International Women’s Day, a group of leading VC funds are grouping together to offer remote office hours for 250-plus women founders from across Europe on May 6th this year. Women founders who want to apply can see more information <a href="http://playfaircapital.com/ffoh/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/431a53c299bd4e1d9a874de6caddb5b5?v=d9b79d9024ab483289637e997290d1a8">apply for the opportunity here</a>.</p>
<p>The initiative aims to dispense with the need for “warm introductions”. Each founder will have the opportunity to meet four investors during one hour of remote office hours to discuss their tech business idea, ask for advice, pitch for investment, or find a mentor.</p>
<p>The event is being held jointly by Playfair Capital, Tech Nation and Google for Startups. Participants include Atomico, Creandum, Dawn, Balderton, EQT, Notion, LocalGlobe, Partech and Sequoia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesman for Playfair said the previous four editions saw a total of 2,000 individual mentoring sessions with 490 founders and 105 investors taking part. To date, 18% of founders went on to raise funding after attending an event, including the founders of Organise, SideQuest, Paid, Freyda and Juno.</p>
<p>Playfair says the event will use “AI matching technology” between founders and investors to further optimize funding outcomes from the event.</p>
<p>Chris Smith, managing partner at Playfair Capital, commented: “The support from the ecosystem has been incredible and we are hugely grateful to all the investors who have thrown their weight behind this event. Starting to hear some of the success stories from previous events is incredibly exciting and early proof that by collaborating at scale and taking a long-term view we can really make an impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several months, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei has turned his concept for “Nothing” into one of the buzziest hardware companies in recent memory. It’s an impressive feat for a company that has offered close to zero information about its upcoming offerings. The company has raised around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nothing-4537">$22 million,</a> including a $15 million Series A last month, led by GV.</p>
<p>Nothing recently announced that it will be releasing its first product &#8212; wireless earbuds &#8212; over the summer. It’s a familiar and saturated category for a self-styled boundary-busting startup. Of course, plenty said that about smartphones, prior to the launch of the OnePlus One in 2014, and they seem to be doing pretty okay for themselves.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It all starts with design, the soul of a product: <a href="https://t.co/n2lPLdCAP4">https://t.co/n2lPLdCAP4</a> <a href="https://t.co/i9YbsNUuJN">pic.twitter.com/i9YbsNUuJN</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Carl Pei (@getpeid) <a href="https://twitter.com/getpeid/status/1369242419540209665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a blog post today, Pei breaks down a bit more of Nothing’s philosophy, along with “Concept 1,” a precursor to the forthcoming unveiling of the company’s first product &#8212; call it next to Nothing, if you must. While the post uses a similarly hyperbolic language as Apple to outline its plans, ultimately Pei points at an approach that is, in some ways a kind of antithesis to Cupertino.</p>
<p>The product is built with a semi-transparent design, as part of an approach that features, “No screens, no dedicated devices, just barely-noticeable technology that empowers us to be more human.” If the screen-less bit is to be believed, in spite of the company’s acquisition of Essential IP, it doesn’t seem that Nothing is going to be launching a phone anytime soon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6fhIySTrXg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/where-are-wearables-going-in-2020/">Where are wearables going in 2020?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where are wearables going in 2020?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/where-are-wearables-going-in-2020/embed/#?secret=6fhIySTrXg" data-secret="6fhIySTrXg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another interesting piece of the puzzle is inspiration from familiar objects. “Concept 1 takes inspiration from a grandmother’s tobacco pipe.” The company announced in late-February that it would be teaming with Teenage Engineering in a partnership that makes the design house’s CEO Jesper Kouthoofd the hardware company’s design lead.</p>
<p>Nothing certainly gets credit for getting the most out of the pre-release hype cycle. Between some solid funding and all of the fan goodwill Pei built up during his time at OnePlus, the company’s first release is shaping up to be one of the more eagerly anticipated hardware announcements of the year &#8212; which is no small feat for a pair of wireless earbuds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://plana.earth">Plan A</a>, a Berlin-based automated SaaS B2B startup, has raised $3 million for its platform that lets companies measure, monitor, reduce and report their environmental footprint thus improving their ESG ratings. French VC <a href="https://demeter-im.com/en/home/">Demeter</a> led the round, with German VC <a href="https://www.coparion.vc/en">Coparion</a> and Softbank joined the round as a strategic investor. The cash will be used to enhance Plans A&#8217;s carbon emission and ESG management software for enterprise customers in Europe, and for international expansion.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the market for emission management solutions at between $10 billion and $26 billion in the next five years. The US Green Deal and new “EU taxonomy for sustainable activities” is putting pressure on businesses to manage their carbon emissions, leading to the ride of platforms like Plan A. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emitwise">Emitwise</a> in the UK has raised $3.4M and there is also while <a href="https://www.watershedclimate.com/">Watershed</a>. However, Plan A says its platform is more comprehensive than other players because of its ongoing automation and monitoring of a company&#8217;s carbon output.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Plan A has managed to garner customers including Société Générale, GANNI, AlbionVC, BMW Foundation, BCG Digital Ventures and football club Werder Bremen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lubomila Jordanova, co-founder and CEO of Plan A, said: &#8220;Plan A&#8217;s technology has transformed companies and enabled them to turn sustainability into a competitive advantage. We have been working for multiple years on developing the best in class technology, and this investment will allow us to further tailor our carbon and ESG management platform to the needs of enterprises worldwide.”</p>
<p>Olivier Bordelanne, partner at Demeter: “There is a high demand for B2B monitoring services and platforms providing data-based insights on companies’ sustainability indicators or climate risk exposures. Among the many companies offering carbon footprint measurements that we have studied recently, Plan A and its team stood out by positioning themselves as the one-stop shop to help businesses calculate, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint via mitigation and offsetting actions.”</p>
<p>Alexander Lüttge, Partner at Coparion, said: &#8220;Plan A offers companies an easy-to-integrate and easy-to-use SaaS solution for carbon footprint transparency, mitigation and offsetting. In our view, their solution is not only the most versatile product for automated emissions data collection in the market, it also creates transparency in emission and cost structures, as well as a significant value-add for companies through the introduction of automated business process optimization.”</p>
<p>Jordanova says competitors tend to calculate carbon footprints on a one-off basis, help with offsetting and then give certificates for the offsetting without supporting doing any further work. “We offer all of those services, but also enable the company to reduce its carbon footprint and learn how to implement sustainability on an ongoing basis,” she told me.</p>
<p>Plan A is in a good place to benefit from new regulatory environments. The new US administration and the EU have been significantly shifting their agenda, requiring a lot more transparency on reporting about emissions. In the Netherlands, more than 90 banks signed an agreement to create more transparency on CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, money is being divested from fossil fuels and diverted into ESG investments. But of course, companies wanting to get hold of that cash have to be able to prove their emissions. That&#8217;s where Plan A comes in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Nordic countries make up just 4% of Europe&#8217;s total population, but they account for a significant amount of venture capital investment.</p>
<p>That said, Norway&#8217;s VC community has been somewhat dormant for a while. The country makes far too much money from oil, giving it one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and a large system of socialized support. Not a bad thing, but as a result, there are few &#8220;hungry&#8221; tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>High-profile players like Northzone and Creandum did well with early entries into Spotify and Klarna, among others, and now Norway is catching up with the rest of the European hubs. Among the trends our survey respondents identified were e-commerce, blockchain and crypto, healthtech, energy, mobility and climate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investments highlighted included Fairown, Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite, Pexip, PortalOne, Dignio, Speiz, Plaace, Glint Solar, variable.co and Nomono. Local investors tend to invest 50% to 90% of their fund into local startups, “but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries,” said one.</p>

<p>On the horizon, there is hope for an increased focus on mental health and wellness from organizations, the press and the government; many also celebrated the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, bitcoin’s rise and a new occupant in the White House.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are coming from portfolio revenue growth, exits and IPOs. One investors we spoke to said Norway is &#8220;becoming a major hub, with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Sean Percival, managing partner, Spring Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
E-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Fairown.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Martech.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Not just COVID-proof but services that thrive in COVID times.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
In Norway, sustainability-focused companies. Lots of good ideas but little revenue growth proven so far.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50% Norway, 50% Nordic/Baltic.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway does video tech well.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Strong B2B, weak B2C, lots of SDG focus.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We are not so hard hit in Norway, so Oslo will likely not see much exodus. It’s still the best place to build a company in this country. Although personally I moved to a small village and don’t see myself moving back to Oslo.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
E-commerce is booming here post-COVID, where before it was rather weak.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our portfolio is heavy on SaaS, which has weathered things well. So for our founders, it’s mostly about keeping churn-and-burn rates low to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
In some cases yes, including our e-commerce SaaS companies and my recent Bitcoin exchange investment (MiraiEx).</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Bitcoin’s rise and new open banking solutions have shown the world’s financial engines are still pushing forward. Everything is being built with less friction these days. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know. Iterate is a cool company builder company flying under the radar. Just had their first big investment success/cash out with a company called Porterbuddy.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Norway is slowing, becoming a major hub with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days (recent investments from SoftBank and Founders fund, for example).</p>
<h2>Espen Malmo, founding partner, Skyfall Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Skyfall focuses on software companies, marketplaces and hardware companies with a recurring software revenue bundle. We are really excited about the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Our team has been involved and invested in crypto since 2012, so we’ve been excited about the industry for a long time. We have invested in two great companies in the sector, the blockchain analytics tool Nansen.ai and the cryptocurrency exchange MiraiEx. We also love embedded commerce and social commerce, which we think will boost the more independent long tail of e-commerce in the years to come. Our portfolio company Outshifter is positioned well to utilize this trend.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It is always hard to pick favorites since we are excited about all our investments, but Nomono is one that really excites us. Nomono is a software and hardware solution to capture and intelligently process voice recordings and spatial audio. The solution enables podcasters to edit their recordings with the click of a button, as a sort of digital audio technician in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
This is super hard to pinpoint and it is really challenging to label an industry as overlooked. Bioinformatics is maybe a little bit overlooked in Norway, but I don’t feel that is the case globally. Also, I think the pure B2B SaaS focus of a lot of VC funds makes it harder than necessary to get funding for hardware companies and companies with a rundle business model, even though hardware revenues bundled with recurring software revenues can create extraordinary outcomes due to high order values and strong lock-in effects.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We invest in strong technical founders solving big problems in markets ripe for change. We usually prefer that the company has a prototype or beta of their solution and some initial market traction.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Both micromobility and telemedicine seem very crowded at this point, and we believe the current market leaders in these sectors will become the winners. I think it will be very hard to enter this space as a new startup at this moment in time.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We have a Nordic investment mandate, but we primarily focus on Norway as we are a Norwegian pre-seed/seed fund and have our competitive insight, network and brand here in Norway. So more than 50% in Norway, but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway has a great track record within the video conferencing and audio industry. After Cisco bought Tandberg, a world-leading video conferencing company, for $3.3 billion in 2010, Video Valley (the area of Lysaker right outside of Oslo) has churned out a lot of successful companies within the space. For example, Acano (acquired by Cisco for $700 million), Pexip (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $1.4 billion) and Huddly (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $0.5 billion). From our own portfolio, both Nomono and Oivi are started by serial entrepreneurs with track records from successful Video Valley companies. Also, Norway is by far the leading country globally in adoption of electric vehicles per capita, and today over 50% of all new cars bought are electrical. This means that Norway is a great playing field for startups piggybacking on the EV revolution and also the green revolution in general. The EV home charger Easee is a company to watch.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Norway is a country where you get access to a highly educated and technically skilled workforce that is proficient in English, and the valuation of the companies is well below the levels you see in the U.S., or even in Sweden. I think Norway is a country to watch, but I obviously also believe that all the Nordic countries will continue to punch well above their “weight class” in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes, the acceptance of working remotely will democratize the startup ecosystem globally. We should see a relative decrease in growth in the traditional hubs of Silicon Valley/SF, Beijing, London, Berlin and so on, compared to a relative increase in companies formed and managed “in the cloud.” We already have one such company in our portfolio, Nansen.ai, which truly is distributed across the world, “in the cloud,” and has been so from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We do not invest in sectors that have been hit directly by the pandemic, so we have been lucky in that way.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
No, we have in many ways been affected positively by COVID-19 as we have major investments in companies that are working with remote work, home delivery, e-commerce, cryptocurrencies and so on. In general, technology looks like the winning category during this pandemic, and I believe that will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
As answered above, a lot of our companies are actually performing better than usual amid COVID.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The decline in infections locally and the rollout of the COVID vaccines. Also, Trump leaving the Oval Office. I don’t think I would have managed four more years with him in the spotlight, inciting hatred and nonsense on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Yes, Johan Brand, co-founder of Kahoot and now an angel investor.</p>

<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Increase but maybe not a surge.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
More international competition for investment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Vaccine news.</p>
<h2>Anne Solhaug Tutar, partner, Antler</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We focus on technology companies and are industry agnostic in general, but in Oslo we have a particular focus on startups within the energy, property and mobility sector.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Speiz, Plaace and Glint Solar are a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Absolutely! We love any company that removes friction and focuses on solving real problems. Very often we see that the best companies are started by founders that have directly been impacted by an inefficiency or problem themselves, and later dedicate their lives to fixing it. Those founders will go above and beyond, and work relentlessly to understand their customers&#8217; needs. We will see a lot of new opportunities from decentralized finance and a shift to a truly global economy where borders and barriers will be surpassed with smart technology.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
The most important factor for any investment we make: a very strong co-founder team. Beyond that, a thoroughly validated business idea and model, a concept that has the potential to scale, traction; rapid growth week over week and founders solving a real problem and not a made-up problem.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We have a decade behind us of incremental innovations. In the next 10 to 20 years, we will see huge leaps and groundbreaking new technologies. Lots of current small improvement solutions will be replaced by technologies that are dramatically changing the way we live, work, collaborate and act.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We can invest anywhere, but the Oslo branch typically invests in locally established companies. I&#8217;d say 90%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Our focus in Norway says a lot about the industries we think have potential for disruption and where Norway holds a particularly strong position; energy, property and mobility.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Compared to other locations, we see that startups based out of Oslo are typically cheaper than in other parts of the world. Investors that are able to identify the right founders can make great investments in Norway. At the same time, Norwegian founders would benefit from more investors with an international focus. The ecosystem of investors and accelerators is rapidly growing in Oslo, and with more and more successful local startups we have a great environment set up for breeding more great companies going forward. We&#8217;re very bullish on what will come out of Oslo over the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Generally we experience two simultaneous trends: More talent being freed up from their previous engagements and more uncertainty, with founders being more on the fence about making the leap. We haven&#8217;t made observations of this being connected to specific cities or areas yet.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s wise to develop completely new businesses based on opportunities from COVID only; rather, COVID can, timing-wise, really spark the launch or growth for some and significantly slow down the growth pace for others.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We invest as per normal and see that there is still a lot of capital ready to be deployed in Norway. Our companies have received a lot of soft funding from government initiatives, which is a huge and highly appreciated help to our portfolio companies. For our startups, and most others, the advice is always to keep the burn rate at manageable levels during this time of extra uncertainty, and plan the fundraising strategy accordingly. Otherwise, it&#8217;s never been more important to be lean and agile. The founders that are able to navigate well in a context with lots of uncertainty can do really well in the current climate!</p>
<h2>Daniel Holth Larsen, principal, Investinor</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Resource efficiency, healthier lifestyles, internet of behaviors, how we work and learn.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Dignio (SaaS/medtech).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Forestry technology; a lot of focus on agriculture, but not forestry. Massive market opportunity, well positioned for SDGs, and driven by megatrends (building with wood, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
In general: Proven scalability in a massive global market opportunity, with a (both) nice and savvy founding team.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I think the consumer fintech space will get hard for startups in the coming years. Banks and institutions have competitive advantages through their large customer bases and access to resources and are investing heavily in the space (both through M&amp;A, but more importantly with in-house initiatives and projects).</li>
<li>Not one particular product per se, but I&#8217;m concerned about nice-to-have enterprise products that are not embedded and adapted in several departments of the customer (i.e., a marketing tool solely used by the marketing team at an organization, or a procurement tool used exclusively by procurement). I think many of these services will have a hard time in the tailwinds of COVID, and I think it is essential to get noticed by C-suites and other departments to survive in the longer run (regardless of your size and number of customers).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%. We are the largest and most active player in Norway by far. In 2020, we did 16 new direct investments, more than 60 follow-up investments, four IPOs, six investments in other venture funds, two complete exits.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The Norwegian ecosystem will continue to thrive and be more and more relevant internationally in regards to software, particularly B2B software. This is driven by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leading technological adaption and usage by the government, institutions and business.</li>
<li>Low risk in career changes: talent fluctuating from leading companies to startups.</li>
<li>Leading support and growth financing initiatives: Innovation Norway, funds, etc.</li>
<li>Great global market access: EU networks, foreign investments, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we especially have advantages in subsectors like proptech, energy, healthcare and education. I&#8217;m particularly excited about Kahoot, Cognite, Dignio (portfolio), Xeneta (portfolio), Gelato, Play Magnus (portfolio) and reMarkable.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Transparent way of doing business: honest, close to zero corruption;</li>
<li>High grade of innovation and many opportunities;</li>
<li>Happy population = happy founders and FTEs, and high productivity;</li>
<li>Favorable policies and regulation (policies and legal proceedings, IPOs, etc.);</li>
<li>No language barriers;</li>
<li>Significant support from government, institutions and local business.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Maybe, maybe not. I still think cities will be the most prominent location for startups as (1) Big business is not rural, and startup founders typically come from banks, consultancies, corporations, etc. and also recruit from the likes of it; and (2) Network access and information is more vast in cities, and even though people are currently staying at home, geographical proximity remains a key factor.<br />
This might happen in the longer run as more corporations recruit more people remotely, but I don&#8217;t see this happening the next following years as a consequence of our situation today. I think it will take more time.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Oil and gas; we have not made any new investments the last three years, but still have some companies in our portfolio (mostly specific technologies for the O&amp;G industries). Its attractiveness was obviously declining pre-COVID as well, but the crisis has only made the sustainable shift stronger. I don&#8217;t see it rebounding to its previous levels. I think startups have opportunities in business partnerships cross-industry, and we are seeing many examples of that now. I also think that software companies that are thriving in the current market have a clear upper hand in building sustainable long-term cultures in their organizations and attracting talent from those other industries affected (travel, aviation, O&amp;G, retail, hotels and accommodation, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Hasn&#8217;t impacted it in a big way as most of our companies are performing well. Founders are primarily concerned with the mental health of their employees. My advice: CEOs should especially spend a lot of time on vision and goals, culture, teamwork and collectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, last year was a record year for us both in terms of exits, IPOs and gross IRR in the portfolio. More than 80% of invested capital is in software, hardware and healthcare, and most of our companies are thriving. We see some, but very few, being negatively affected in a big way.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing well personally, but I have enjoyed seeing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our fantastic team members and founders getting the recognition they deserve.</li>
<li>Stagnating unemployment, people getting back to work.</li>
<li>Increased focus on mental health and wellbeing from organizations, the press and government.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Some:<br />
Kremena Tosheva (SNÖ Ventures, investor), Karen Dolva (No Isolation, founder CEO), Frida Rustøen (Idékapital, investor), Ann-Tove Kongsnes (Investinor, investor), Trond Riiber Knudsen (TRK, investor), Patrick Sandahl (Investinor, investor), Bente Sollid Storehaug (chairperson), Birger Magnus (chairperson), Erik Langaker (chairperson, investor), Anders Kvåle (Arkwright, entrepreneur, investor), Mathilde Tuv Kverneland (Arkwright X, investor), Dilan Mizrakli Landgraff (Antler, investor), Jacob Tveraabak (entrepreneur, investor), Remi Dramstad (Selmer, lawyer), Martin Schütt (Askeladden, founder/investor), Christian Sagstad (Thommessen, lawyer), Jan Grønbech (growth expert), Nils Thommessen (ex-lawyer, investor and board person), Eilert Hanoa (CEO of Kahoot, investor), Tom Even Mortensen (investor, growth expert), Birgitte Villmo (Investinor, investor), Bente Loe (Alliance Ventures, investor).</p>
<h2>Magne Uppman, managing partner, SNÖ Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We invest across all digital tech, but some of the areas we have been looking more into lately include health tech, future of work, event and creative tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment was a follow-on investment in PortalOne, the world’s first hybrid games company. PortalOne converges gaming, shows and the broader entertainment industry into one platform in a really fun and engaging way. It is like nothing you have ever seen before. Spun out of Oslo, they are soon ready to launch in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
One space that continues to evolve is the integration of social into various sectors &#8212; e.g., social fitness, social shopping, etc. And particularly, how we can recreate the connections that we make in the physical world in the digital version, leveraging the unique accessibility and reach that the digital platform offers.<br />
We also think there are significant advancements to be made within the privacy sector against a backdrop of increased data vulnerability and third-party access to information.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Brilliant and ambitious founder teams. And being in Norway, we want them to target a much larger and hopefully also global market pretty soon after launch. Norway and the Nordics are perfect testing pits, with a digitally advanced, high-trust population, but too small a market for most tech companies that want to become big.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We believe that most areas pretty fast become crowded, and try to avoid companies that do only incremental improvements in oversaturated areas. But we don’t necessarily avoid competition if the businesses have a transformative technology and see solutions or have secrets that others have not yet seen.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
So far we’ve been focused on Norwegian companies only, but with our upcoming fund, we will be pan-Nordic. We expect that about 50% of our investments will be Norwegian, whereas the other 50% will be spread across Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We see a good variety of exciting companies from Oslo and Norway. Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite and Pexip have been leading the way lately, with new ones like Memory, Tibber, PortalOne, reMarkable and many others coming right behind. We also believe that Norway’s strong roots with industrial companies now seem to move into tech, for example with a highly skilled workforce moving over from the oil and gas industry, as well as really exciting companies coming out of this area &#8212; Cognite being a strong example. Norway also has some unique strengths in ocean tech, renewable energy, agriculture and shipping, all fields that we believe will produce exciting startups built around tech advancements.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem. They should know that the Nordics are fragmented, so it’s not enough to know Stockholm; they should also invest time in the other Nordic hubs in order to succeed with a Nordic investment strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The trend of remote work will increase. We have portfolio companies that don’t even have an office today; Confrere, for instance, which offers a video meeting and conferencing platform currently focused primarily on the healthcare sector, has all their employees working remote. But we also see a strong advantage of companies being tightly connected to a startup hub, there is so much learning, inspiration and network to be shared. Hopefully we’ll see even more minihubs being built around the country, and them connecting tightly to each other. There is a lot of potential in more and better collaboration between the different hubs, locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Some of the industry segments that look weaker are business travel, retail and hospitality. Exciting opportunities exist within event, games, work tools and efficiency, health tech and sustainability. One particularly interesting challenge is to understand and anticipate which of the trends that have arisen during these times will be temporary and which will be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Some areas have developed fast, and that impacts which areas we focus on. The biggest worries on the portfolio side have been (1) that their B2B sales will be affected and (2) that the investment climate will be more challenging. Our advice has been to secure a long runway for some companies, whereas other companies have accelerated because of the shifts caused by COVID-19 and need to run even faster.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, the first two months were hard for some of the portfolio companies, but after that things recovered and they mostly are back at the revenue growth that they planned for before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
At SNÖ we often draw the comparison between being a founder and the proud heritage we have in Norway with polar explorers and their great expeditions. What our founders have shown the last year, through these uncertain times, gives me good hope that this comparison is valid like never before. Entrepreneurs are the polar explorers of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
There are many in the Oslo scene that have contributed a lot during the last few years; Rolf Assev, Alexander Woxen, Per Einar Dybvik, Tor Bækkelund, Kjetil Holmefjord at StartupLab, Ingar Bentsen and Hans Christian Bjørne at TheFactory, Anniken Fjelberg at 657, Anders Mjåset at Mesh, Heidi Aven at SHE, Knut Wien and Maja Adriaensen at Startup Norway, Lucas H. Weldeghebriel and Per-Ivar Nikolaisen at Shifter. And many more. All great people who deserve praise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm said on Tuesday it is turning NFC-enabled Android smartphones into point-of-sale machines, as it looks to win more merchants in one of the world&#8217;s largest mobile payments markets.</p>
<p>A Paytm merchant partner will now be able to enable card acceptance feature on their NFC-enabled smartphone from the Paytm Business app, the Indian startup said. Once activated, they will be able to process a transaction by tapping a plastic card to their phone.</p>
<p>Paytm Smart POS supports Visa, Mastercard, and Rupay, the startup said, whereas the amount limit on a single transaction is set to 5000 Indian rupees, or about $69. (More than 90% of transactions in India carry a value equal to or smaller than $69, industry estimates say.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Current batch of payment devices in the market haven’t proven very successful in reaching Indian small and medium sized businesses, most of which remain offline, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm, at a virtual press conference today.</p>
<p>To win these merchants, Paytm has in recent years rolled out QR codes that work across several payment networks, and launched jukeboxes and other gadgets to make it easier for merchants to accept payments digitally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="493" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=768,370 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=680,327 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With today’s move, said Sharma, “the obligation of buying a POS machine, too, is no longer needed.” The startup said that most new Android smartphone models support the NFC feature.</p>
<p>Paytm also unveiled the newer generation of jukebox POS that looks similar to a QR placard. &#8220;The reason why merchants haven&#8217;t actively adopted many of the existing POS machines is that they are not comfortable using them,&#8221; said Dilip Asbe, head of payments body NPCI, at the virtual conference.</p>
<p>The Indian startup, which processed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/paytm-claims-top-spot-in-india-mobile-payments-market-with-1-2-billion-monthly-transactions/">more than 1.2 billion transactions last month</a> and claimed top spot in the local mobile payments market, said it will charge a small subscription fee to merchant partners for accessing either of the aforementioned payments services.</p>
<p>The move pits Paytm against Sequoia Capital-backed Pine Labs, a market leader in the POS category but a significantly smaller startup, and also demonstrates just how aggressively Paytm and other giant payment firms are expanding to cater to merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the way, mobile phones saw an evolution from featurephone to smartphone, we believe the merchant PoS market in India is at an inflexion point to evolve from the traditional (aka dumb-PoS) to Smart-PoS. Unlike traditional PoS, which only allows transactions from debit/credit-card, some of the features of a Smart-PoS are: GST compliant bill, scanner/printer, takes all payments including UPI, is Bluetooth enabled and could be customized for different merchants as per their needs. While currently the Fintech companies are offering these devices, we expect banks to catch-up eventually,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent note to clients.</p>

<p>&#8220;Microinfluencers&#8221; are gaining clout among marketers. Though they may have as little as a thousand followers, microinfluencers tend to focus on specific content and be seen as more engaging and trustworthy by their audience, said Allan Ko, founder and chief executive officer of Influenxio. The Taipei-based startup, which connects brands with Instagram microinfluencers through its online platform, announced today that it has closed $2 million in pre-Series A funding led by DCM Ventures, and is launching a new subscription plan.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Influenxio has now raised over $3 million in total, including from seed investor SparkLabs Taipei. It currently operates in Taiwan and Japan, where it has databases of 100,000 and 250,000 Instagram creators, respectively. So far, over 6,000 brands have registered on Influenxio&#8217;s platform, and it has been used to run over 1,000 campaigns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Influenxio plans to use its new funding for hiring and product development. Influenxio&#8217;s new subscription plan is a relatively novel model for the field, so one of the startup&#8217;s goals is to prove that it works, Ko told TechCrunch. The company also plans to build out its Japanese platform and expand into more countries.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122728" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122728" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122728" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?w=680" alt="A screenshot of Influenxio's platform" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122728" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of Influenxio&#8217;s platform</p></div></p>
<p>Influenxio analyzes past campaigns, performance data and client reviews to improve its algorithms. Since the entire campaign creation process&#8211;from finding influencers to paying them&#8211;is performed through Influenxio, this allows it to gather a wide range of data to refine its technology, Ko told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Influencers typically make about $35 to $40 USD for each campaign they participate in, and most of the brands the company works with focus on food (like restaurants), fashion, beauty or lifestyle services.</p>
<p>Before launching Influenxio, Ko spent 15 years working in the digital marketing field, serving as an account manager at Yahoo! and Microsoft, and then head of Hong Kong and Taiwan for Google&#8217;s online partnerships group. He wanted to create a startup that would combine what he had learned about digital marketing and make accessible to more businesses.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DCM is poised to make roughly $1 billion off its $26 million bet on Bill.com&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/dcm-has-already-made-nearly-1-billion-off-its-26-4-million-bet-on-bill-com/embed/#?secret=Sn8pbTnpwi" data-secret="Sn8pbTnpwi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Large brands have used Influenxio to quickly generate marketing campaigns for special occasions like Mother&#8217;s Day or Christmas. For example, one advertiser in Taiwan used Influenxio to hire almost 200 influencers in one week, who were asked to test and post about their products, and some of Influenxio’s highest profile clients include Shiseido, Shopee, iHerb and KKBox.</p>
<p>But the majority of Influenxio&#8217;s clients (about 80% to 90%) are small- to medium-sized businesses, and Ko said they usually create multiple campaigns to build brand awareness over time, working with a few influencers a month.</p>
<p>Influenxio&#8217;s new subscription plan, which costs less than $100 USD a month and is launching first in Taiwan before rolling out to other markets, was created for them. &#8220;The first year we launched the platform, we found small businesses want experts and advice,&#8221; said Ko. Many don’t have marketing managers, so Influenxio&#8217;s subscription plan automatically matches them with new influencers each month and provides them with analytics so they can see how well campaigns are performing.</p>
<p>Influenxio is among a growing number of startups that are tapping into the &#8220;microinfluencer economy,&#8221; with others including AspireIQ, Upfluence and Grin.</p>
<p>Ko said Influenxio&#8217;s biggest difference is its focus on small businesses, and serving as a one-stop marketplace for influencer campaigns. &#8220;The important thing for our platform is that it needs to be very easy and simple,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We spent a lot of time on the execution and details to make it smoother on the advertiser side. For the influencer side, we try to make it more convenient. For example, the way they receive money, our goal is to also make it easy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kia started the year by dropping &#8220;motor company&#8221; from its corporate name and revealing a new logo and slogan as part of Plan S, a strategy to shift its business away from internal combustion engines and towards EVs, mobility services and autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>Now, the South Korean automaker is starting to share more details of the first vehicle that will come out of <a href="https://press.kia.com/eu/en/home/media-resouces/press-releases/2020/Plan_S.html">Plan S</a>. Kia released Tuesday several teaser images of the EV6, its first dedicated battery-electric vehicle built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP platform. This platform is shared with Hyundai and is the underlying foundation of the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 compact crossover.</p>
<p>These are teasers and so the vehicle isn&#8217;t shown in full. But even with the limited view enough design features are visible to begin to understand what Kia&#8217;s design language means for the EV6 and its other future electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EV6 is a four-door crossover, which isn&#8217;t a surprise considering the popularity of such vehicles in the U.S. The low front end moves up into a roofline that is reminiscent of a coupe. The LED headlights have a segmented pattern and the traditional grille found on internal combustion engine vehicles is gone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122721" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122721" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2122721 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg" alt="Kia teases EV6" width="1350" height="759" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_its_first_dedicated_EV.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122721" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Kia</p></div></p>
<p>The company also revealed a new naming scheme to help consumers easily identify the EVs in its lineup. Kia said its new dedicated battery electric vehicles will all start with the &#8220;EV&#8221; prefix. A number will follow &#8220;EV&#8221; to indicate the vehicle&#8217;s position the line-up. That puts the EV6 somewhere in the middle of its upcoming lineup.</p>
<p>Kia said the EV6 will make its world premiere during the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to design the physical experience of our brand and to create bold, original and inventive electric vehicles,&#8221; Karim Habib, senior vice president and head of Kia Global Design Center, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kia&#8217;s strategy is more ambitious though than creating bold, original and inventive electric vehicles. The company said last year that it wanted to become a pioneer in the age of EVs, a brand beloved by the millennial generation and Z generation and a symbol of challenge and innovation. Kia has placed sales and product goals behind those aspirational objectives, including the launch of 11 EVs by 2025 that will give it a 6.6% global EV market share, selling 500,000 electric vehicles annually by 2026, and offering customized purpose-built electric vehicles for corporate customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122722" style="width: 1360px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122722" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2122722 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="759" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kia_teases_EV6_EV.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122722" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Kia</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also putting some capital behind the effort, to the tune of 29 trillion won (US $25 billion) by the end of 2025.  Kia said its targeting a 6% operating profit margin and 10.6% return on equity (ROE) ratio during this time period.</p>
<p>The EV6 is the first product of Plan S, a vehicle that will show investors and consumers if Kia&#8217;s grand plans are achievable. In other words, the EV6 is important for Kia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, the developer of popular gaming title PUBG Mobile, has invested $22.4 million in Indian esports firm Nodwin Gaming, the two firms said Tuesday as the South Korean firm looks to maintain some presence in what was once its key overseas market.</p>
<p><a href="http://nodwingaming.com">Nodwin Gaming</a>, a subsidiary of local gaming giant Nazara, has established itself as one of the largest esports firms in India.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm today works with several firms including Blizzard Entertainment, Valve, Riot Games, ESL to help them host events, provide commentary, produce and license content, and amass brands and sponsors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nodwin, which recently expanded to Africa, will deploy the fresh capital to accelerate its growth in international markets, it said.</p>
<p>Krafton and Nodwin have been engaging with one another for some time. The two firms last week announced that they will be collaborating to hold two PUBG Mobile events in Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Esports will be a key pillar to the growth of sports entertainment in the future. It sits at a wonderful intersection of sports, entertainment and technology where nations such as India can pave the path. With Krafton coming on board, we have an endorsement from the mecca of gaming and esports &#8212; South Korea &#8212; on what we are building from India for the world based on our competence in mobile first markets,&#8221; said Akshat Rathee, co-founder and managing director of Nodwin Gaming, in a statement.</p>
<p>India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned PUBG Mobile</a> and hundreds of other apps with affiliation to China last year citing cybersecurity concerns. Krafton has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">attempting to bring PUBG Mobile back in India</a>, but hasn’t had any luck yet.</p>
<p>To assuage New Delhi’s concerns about users’ security, Krafton said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with Chinese publisher Tencent</a>. (It also inked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/pubg-mobile-plots-return-to-india-following-ban/">global cloud deal with Microsoft</a>.) Sean Hyunil Sohn, the head of Corporate Development at Krafton, said earlier this month at a gaming conference that the firm “<a href="https://in.ign.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-mobile-iphone/155759/news/pubg-mobile-india-release-date-krafton-will-work-hard-to-make-it-happen">will work hard</a>” to bring PUBG Mobile back in India, but didn’t elaborate.</p>
<p>“Krafton is excited to partner with Nodwin Gaming to help foster the promising esports ecosystem and engage with our fans and players in India,” said Changhan Kim, chief executive of Krafton in a statement.</p>
<p>“Taking the momentum from this partnership, we will explore additional investment opportunities in the region to uphold our commitment and dedication in cultivating the local video game, esports, entertainment, and tech industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released a set of security updates for iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. There are no new features — but these are updates you will still want to install.</p>
<p>As part of these security fixes, iPhones and iPads will <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212221">update to iOS and iPadOS 14.4.1</a>, watchOS users <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212222">will update to 7.3.2</a> and macOS Big Sur <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212220">will update to 11.2.3</a>. Those on older versions of macOS can install the latest version of Safari, bumping <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212223">the version to 14.0.3</a>.</p>
<p>Apple says these are &#8220;important&#8221; security updates and are &#8220;recommended for all users.&#8221;</p>
<p>These patches fix the same vulnerability — a memory corruption bug in WebKit, the engine that powers Apple&#8217;s Safari browser. The bug can be triggered by visiting a malicious web page containing code that can exploit the vulnerability. Once exploited, an attacker can run malicious code on the affected Apple device.</p>
<p>The bugs were reported by Google and Microsoft, but are not believed to be actively exploited by malicious hackers unlike recent security flaws.</p>
<p>Last month, Apple pushed out iOS 14.4 to fix three WebKit vulnerabilities that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">were being &#8220;actively exploited.&#8221;</a> The vulnerabilities were chained together to break into the underlying iPhone software.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter from TechCrunch all about space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Mondays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes even the biggest successes look like failures on video. That&#8217;s the theme of this week, because the biggest news by far was SpaceX&#8217;s test launch of its latest Starship prototype in South Texas.</p>
<h3>It looked fake &#8212; but the fireball proved it wasn&#8217;t</h3>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s test flight was a launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/spacexs-starship-prototype-flies-to-32000-feet-and-sticks-the-landing-in-third-flight-test/">10th Starship prototype, to a height of around 32,000 feet</a>, at which point it used its Raptor engines to flip into a flop maneuver and then fall back to Earth in a roughly horizontal orientation, before re-lighting its engines very near the ground and flipping back vertical for a soft landing. All of which actually happened as described, for the first time, causing many TC readers to suggest it was an elaborate CG fake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t &#8212; after SpaceX cameras cut away, but while others were luckily still filming, the SN10 prototype met the same fiery end as the last two SpaceX rockets that did the high-flying act. The explosion that totally destroyed the rocket happened a few minutes after it sat stationary post-landing, and while it maybe didn&#8217;t provide the best optics, the real takeaway is that SpaceX proved the crazy landing maneuver Starship will use for reusability actually works in real-world conditions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2066317" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2066317" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2066317" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2066317" class="wp-caption-text">Starlink&#8217;s UT antenna for residential customers.</p></div></p>
<p>SpaceX kinda needs the Starship to start working more and more often, because the big new rocket has a lot of work to do. As the space company continues to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/spacex-launches-60-new-starlink-satellites-while-starship-moves-closer-to-being-able-to-launch-up-to-400-at-a-time/">Starlink satellites, including 60 more this past week</a>, it really wants to be launching up to 400 at a time using Starship&#8217;s generous cargo compartment. And there are humans waiting in the wings for a Starship ride, too: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who bought out an entire Starship mission for a trip around the moon and back in 2023, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spacexs-first-paying-moon-flight-customer-wants-to-give-away-eight-seats-aboard-his-spaceship/">opened applications for eight other passengers who will join him &#8212; at his expense</a>.</p>

<h3>The SPAC man closes out his personal stake</h3>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, the chairman of Virgin Galactic, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/virgin-galactic-chairman-chamath-palihapitiya-sells-off-remaining-personal-stake-in-the-space-company/">sold his entire personal stake in the company</a> after ushering it into the public markets last year via a SPAC merger with his Social Capital Hedosophia. Palihapitiya still retains a 6.2% ownership stake via that vehicle, in partnership with Ian Osborne, but his own independent holdings are now at zero.</p>

<p>Palihapitiya says he &#8220;remains as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic&#8217;s team, mission and prospects,&#8221; and that the only reason he liquidated his position was to provide funds for a climate-focused investment he&#8217;ll be taking the lid off soon. Public market investors seem not to have retained the same confidence, however, with price down consistently since news of the chairman&#8217;s sale came out last week.</p>
<h3>Early Stage</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Early Stage</a> is the premier “how-to” event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, a well-known no-code automation tool, has purchased <a href="https://www.makerpad.co/">Makerpad</a>, a no-code education service and community. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered Zapier often during its life, including its first, and only, fundraising event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/zapier-raises-1-2m-seed-round/">a $1.2 million round</a> back in 2012 that tapped Bessemer, DFJ and others. Since then the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/zapier-launches-250month-team-accounts/">added more expensive tiers to its service</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/zapier-makes-it-easier-for-teams-to-collaborate-on-their-app-workflows/">built out team-focused features</a>, and recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/zapier-ceo-wade-foster-on-scaling-a-remote-team-up-to-300-employees/">talked to Extra Crunch</a> about how it scaled its remote-only team.</p>
<p>In an interview Monday, Zapier CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/wadefoster?lang=en">Wade Foster</a> told TechCrunch that his company now has 400 workers and crossed the $100 million ARR mark last summer.</p>
<p>The Makerpad deal is its first acquisition. TechCrunch asked Makerpad founder <a href="https://twitter.com/bentossell">Ben Tossell</a> about the structure of the deal, who said via email that his company will operate as a &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; entity from its new parent company.</p>
<p>The deal doesn&#8217;t seem prepped to upend what the smaller startup was working on before it was signed. &#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; Tossell wrote, &#8220;Makerpad&#8217;s vision is to educate as many people as possible on the possibilities of building without writing code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foster seems content with that focus, describing to TechCrunch how he intends to let Makerpad operate largely independently, albeit inside a set of editorial guidelines.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked the Makerpad founder why this was the right time to sell his business. He said that the pairing would help his team take the no-code world farther than it could alone, also noting that the deal was a &#8220;no-brainer&#8221; over &#8220;alternative routes such as VC funding.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tracking the growth of low-code, no-code startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/embed/#?secret=c4sAZJYuus" data-secret="c4sAZJYuus" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The acquisition was partially driven by a single tweet. <a href="https://twitter.com/smalter/status/1305964910866771969">This one</a>, in fact. According to Tossell, the CEO of Zapier reached out after reading it, leading to conversations and a deal. Foster expanded on the story during a call, saying that he had long followed Tossell&#8217;s work and that the two had met previously at dinners. The tweet wound up in his Slack, he said, so he reached out to the Makerpad founder, and from there it was a pretty quick ramp to a deal.</p>
<p>The two companies have seen rapid growth in recent quarters. Foster detailed to TechCrunch how small businesses have become increasingly reliant on his company&#8217;s service in the post-COVID world, with Zapier seeing strong SMB adoption after the pandemic hit. Given the digital transformation&#8217;s acceleration, that&#8217;s a trend that likely won&#8217;t slow soon. And Tossell told TechCrunch that no-code has already &#8220;grown bigger than [he] had imagined it could,&#8221; with his company seeing users expanding 4x in just under the last year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=34BLMCvUwu" data-secret="34BLMCvUwu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zapier, perhaps one of the largest success stories in the broad swath of technology products that we might call the no-code world, now has an attached community that could help directly add users to its service, and perhaps indirectly by making the aggregate pool of no-coders larger over time.</p>
<p>The no-code space has been active in recent months, as has its sibling niche, the low-code market. The latter has seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">recent rounds in the nine figures</a>, as some corporations turn to low-code tools to help them more quickly build internal software. The no-code world has its own successes, like Zapier&#8217;s nine-figure revenues.</p>
<p>Foster was neutral on more acquisitions, neither closing the door on them when TechCrunch asked, but not opening it any wider at the same time. On the SPAC question, however, the CEO was a bit clearer. That&#8217;s a no.</p>
<p>After having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">spoken to a grip of no-code</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/">and low-code founders</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/">and investors</a> in recent months, it seems clear that the broader business market is coming around to low-code services and that smaller companies have been quick adopters of no-code tooling. As low-code tools become increasingly abstracted from coding, and no-code tools add functionality, perhaps we&#8217;ll see the two related categories merge.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Americans are bored, housebound and screened out. This has created a golden opportunity for audio as consumers turn to podcasts, voice assistants and smart speakers — often at the same time.</p>
<p>Roughly 128 million Americans use a voice assistant <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/voice-assistant-and-smart-speaker-users-2020">at least once a month</a>. Smartphones account for most voice assistants, but there are also <a href="https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615316037338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7XyfWLp9_d5MaFpOP3194pzC8zw">nearly 160 million smart speakers in American homes.</a></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Hundreds of hardware and software makers are not easily ceding control of their users to the tech giants, and instead are seeking to introduce their own solutions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>One of the hottest forms of audio content is, of course, podcasts. Listeners have never had so many choices for smart and compelling podcast content, with new exciting shows emerging daily. On the consumption side, monthly podcast listeners <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2020/">topped 100 million</a> for the first time in 2020, a 40% increase in just two years.</p>
<p>Listeners get their podcasts from dedicated podcast apps (such as Stitcher), publisher apps (like NPR’s), music apps (such as Spotify), or their default phone app or voice assistant. With more than <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/">1.7 million podcasts</a> being produced today, even the most dedicated podcast listeners can’t listen to every episode in their queue.</p>
<p>This is where voice assistants come in.</p>
<p>The major voice assistants — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung — dominate, but they face increasing competition for users from white-label voice assistants. This has become a battle that will be decided by whichever company can provide the best quality of service.</p>
<p>That’s why the voice assistant that can personalize podcasts and help listeners search, sample and discover content through shareable bite-sized pieces will win the voice wars.</p>
<h2>A familiar battle over users</h2>
<p>Early consumer electronics battles for users were waged over the operating system — Windows vs. Mac. Voice is another form of operating system and the battle over voice is no less fierce.</p>
<p>Apple’s Siri was the first modern virtual assistant to reach the masses. Amazon and Google have also heavily invested — <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/why-tech-giants-are-so-desperate-to-provide-your-voice-assistant">often at a loss</a> — to own voice activation for users, grab market share and protect their turf (e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google).</p>
<p>Amazon took <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-opens-its-voice-assistant-to-developers-as-it-pursues-alexa-and-siri-1541151843">24% of the virtual assistant market in 2018</a>, followed by Apple (22%), Google (20%), Microsoft’s Cortana (10%) (largely confined to desktop) and Samsung’s Bixby (6%).</p>
<p>These five major brands were early pioneers, but the next phase of the voice wars will be white-labeled, with voice assistants incorporated into all devices and brands.</p>
<h2>The rise of white-label voice assistants</h2>
<p>Unable to develop their own voice assistants, hundreds of device manufacturers must resort to Google or Alexa if they want to add voice functionality to their products. But in a way, this is a Trojan horse: Adding Google or Alexa voice enhances products but undermines user relationships.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As an early-stage founder, how do you identify the right investors? Or know how to hire the best possible team to set up your company for growth? Should you bootstrap, and if so, how do you do it successfully? How do you nail virtual pitch meetings?

<p>At the virtual event, we’re bringing together some of the most seasoned operators in the fields of legal, recruiting, product, data security and sales to help you find your way through a tactical quagmire to the bright light of success at the end of the tunnel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the show will cover more than operational challenges. We also have many, many sessions around fundraising, from how to think about raising your Series A to how to get an investors attention.<br />
If you’re in the midst of building a company, this show is worth making time for. Plus, audience members will be able to ask expert speakers their own questions to in each and every breakout session.</p>

He will provide insights on how to network, craft a great pitch and target the best investors for your success.</p>
<h2>How to Nail Your Virtual Pitch Meeting (Melissa Bradley — Ureeka)</h2>
<p>The rules of the pitch meeting have changed. Instead of traveling across the country, wasting time in planes, trains and automobiles, founders can take upward of 30 meetings in a day from the comfort of their home.

<h2>10 Things NOT To Do When You Are Starting a Company (Leah Solivan — Fuel Capital)</h2>

<h2>How to Build Your Early Team for Future Growth (Sarah Smith — Bain Capital Ventures)</h2>

Hear Bain Capital Ventures partner Sarah Smith talk through how to recruit a top-notch early team that sets your startup up for future growth.</p>
<h2>Contracts, Cap Tables and other Legal Questions (Dawn Belt — Fenwick)</h2>
<p>No matter the industry, your startup requires legal help. Whether it&#8217;s building out the cap table, writing up contracts, understanding the laws around hiring or simply feeling secure with a TOS. Whatever the question, Fenwick partner Dawn Belt has the answer.</p>
<h2>Finance for Founders (Alexa von Tobel — Inspired Capital)</h2>
<p>As a founder, you not only have to master your company&#8217;s finances, you also have to tackle your own personal finances.

<h2>Building and Leading a Sales Team (Ryan Azus — Zoom)</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, even the very best products don&#8217;t sell themselves. Salespeople do. Hear from Zoom&#8217;s chief revenue officer, at the helm of the company&#8217;s sales team during the biggest period of growth of any software company ever, lay out how to build a stellar sales team.</p>
<h2>The All-22 View (Eghosa Omoigui — EchoVC Partners)</h2>
<p>Improving line of sight and dynamic field of play aperture is rarely discussed but hugely important. Great founders, operators and investors have an understanding of playbooks on both sides of the ball. We&#8217;ll talk through lessons and some ideas on how to build muscle memory and skillsets so that founders never lose perspective when it&#8217;s time to make a big decision.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll also have some great sessions from our partners too!</p>

<p>How do venture capital investors value formal intellectual property (IP) rights in connection with a decision to fund a technology or life sciences startup? How do they conduct IP due diligence?

<h2>An M&amp;A Playbook for Startup Founders: Lessons from Google and Microsoft (brought to you by <a href="http://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>)</h2>

<h2>Why Founders Should Adopt OKRs Now? (brought to you by <a href="https://dell.to/TechCrunch">Dell for Entrepreneurs</a>)</h2>
<p>Execution is key to a startup&#8217;s survival and growth especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology products. Being in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and employees, a founder needs to balance priorities, align teams and create a visionary product that works. Moreover, in this age of hyperfeedback loops and changing business models, the founder has to be agile enough to absorb and quickly react to changes in the product roadmap and consumer needs. OKRs — a toolkit used mostly by engineering and product teams is more than relevant now for founders of all kinds to embrace. Join the session to learn the history of OKRs, what they are about and witness case studies of successful real-life adoption.</p>
<h2>Naming and Protecting Your Company’s Intellectual Property (brought to you by <a href="http://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>)</h2>
<p>You have an idea for a game-changing product or service — what do you call it? Once you’ve picked a name, how do you make sure nobody else is using it? Is the domain and Twitter handle available? Brainbase makes it easy for anyone to file a trademark without a lawyer and instantly own your brand across all channels. In this session, Brainbase co-founder and CEO Nate Cavanaugh will explain the importance of owning your company’s trademark, both for brand protection and for fundraising due diligence.</p>
<h2>Nailing the Little Things: How Startups Can Achieve Operational Excellence from &#8220;Day One&#8221; (brought to you by <a href="https://www.bcapgroup.com/">B Capital Group</a>)</h2>
<p>The early days of launching a company can be a whirlwind for founding teams as unexpected challenges and opportunities require flexibility, agility and speed. But implementing a few key operating best practices and processes early can be a crucial part of a startup&#8217;s success or failure when it prepares for rapid growth. Join partners from B Capital Group, a multistage global investor, to learn about the most important things you can do to set your startup up for success early in your journey, and what will be most important to investors as you raise your Seed, A and B funding rounds. Speakers include Howard Morgan, chairman of B Capital Group and co-founder of First Round Capital, and partners Karen Page (formerly of Box) and Gabe Greenbaum (formerly of Pritzker Group).</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Obviously, we venture beyond electrification into autonomous vehicles and connectivity. There will be a lot of value creation once OEMs are able to surface their APIs."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since <a href="https://www.inmotionventures.com/">InMotion Ventures</a>, the independent investment and incubation initiative set up by <a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/">Jaguar Land Rover</a>, launched in 2016 the firm has focused on backing companies across the mobility space broadly. Its 15 active investments run the gamut from autonomous vehicles, to car insurance tech, to ride-sharing, and travel planning, but increasingly the firm is focusing its efforts on vehicle electrification and sustainable supply chains.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As the mobility market moves to embrace electrification, InMotion wants to make sure its portfolio is in the mix.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s evident from its most recent investment in <a href="https://www.circulor.com/">Circulor</a>, a company that monitors supply chains from raw material inputs to finished outputs with an eye toward sustainable sourcing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an OEM nowadays it’s increasingly important to have increasing transparency and visibility into how all of those materials have been sourced,&#8221; said the firm&#8217;s managing director, Sebastian Peck. Circulor already has a strong footprint in the automotive industry, Peck said, and is working with a major oil company on tracing the share of recycled plastics that have come from that provider. &#8220;It has applications across any industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jaguar Land Rover is also using Circulor&#8217;s technology to track a material that&#8217;s being used in the interior of one of the company&#8217;s vehicles, Peck said. The stealthy project hasn&#8217;t been publicly revealed yet, but the company has worked with a university and supplier to trace the material from its point of origin to the finished product.</p>
<p>Sustainable supply chains aren&#8217;t the only priorities Peck laid out in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As the mobility market moves to embrace electrification, InMotion wants to make sure its portfolio is in the mix and Peck said it would be looking to make investments in a number of different areas around electric vehicles and batteries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have looked at a number of companies who are developing new battery chemistries. We haven’t made an investment yet,&#8221; Peck said. &#8220;We don’t have a deep enough insight into the IP portfolios of the big battery suppliers to really be able to reliably benchmark those new chemistries. We have not had enough conviction to make an investment or back a particular company. From a value chain it is two or three steps away from us. It’s a space we’re looking at.&#8221;</span></p>
