										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI is fundamental to many products and services today, but its hunger for data and computing cycles is bottomless. <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">Lightmatter</a> plans to leapfrog Moore&#8217;s law with its ultra-fast photonic chips specialized for AI work, and with a new $80M round the company is poised to take its light-powered computing to market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/">We first covered Lightmatter in 2018</a>, when the founders were fresh out of MIT and had raised $11M to prove that their idea of photonic computing was as valuable as they claimed. They spent the next three years and change building and refining the tech — and running into all the hurdles that hardware startups and technical founders tend to find.</p>
<p>For a full breakdown of what the company&#8217;s tech does, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/">read that feature</a> — the essentials haven&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightmatter aims to reinvent AI-specific chips with photonic computing and $11M in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/embed/#?secret=dEvauhgfo6" data-secret="dEvauhgfo6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a nutshell, Lightmatter&#8217;s chips perform certain complex calculations fundamental to machine learning in a flash — literally. Instead of using charge, logic gates, and transistors to record and manipulate data, the chips use photonic circuits that perform the calculations by manipulating the path of light. It&#8217;s been possible for years, but until recently getting it to work at scale, and for a practical, indeed a highly valuable purpose has not.</p>
<h2>Prototype to product</h2>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t entirely clear in 2018 when Lightmatter was getting off the ground whether this tech would be something they could sell to replace more traditional compute clusters like the thousands of custom units companies like Google and Amazon use to train their AIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew in principle the tech should be great, but there were a lot of details we needed to figure out,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Nick Harris told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;Lots of hard theoretical computer science and chip design challenges we needed to overcome&#8230; and COVID was a beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>With suppliers out of commission and many in the industry pausing partnerships, delaying projects, and other things, the pandemic put Lightmatter months behind schedule, but they came out the other side stronger. Harris said that the challenges of building a chip company from the ground up were substantial, if not unexpected.</p>

<p>&#8220;In general what we&#8217;re doing is pretty crazy,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;We&#8217;re building computers from nothing. We design the chip, the chip package, the card the chip package sits on, the system the cards go in, and the software that runs on it&#8230;. we&#8217;ve had to build a company that straddles all this expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>That company has grown from its handful of founders to more than 70 employees in Mountain View and Boston, and the growth will continue as it brings its new product to market.</p>
<p>Where a few years ago Lightmatter&#8217;s product was more of a well-informed twinkle in the eye, now it has taken a more solid form in the Envise, which they call a &#8216;general purpose photonic AI accelerator.&#8221; It&#8217;s a server unit designed to fit into normal datacenter racks but equipped with multiple photonic computing units, which can perform neural network inference processes at mind-boggling speeds. (It&#8217;s limited to certain types of calculations, namely linear algebra for now, and not complex logic, but this type of math happens to be a major component of machine learning processes.)</p>
<p>Harris was reticent to provide exact numbers on performance improvements, but more because those improvements are increasing than that they&#8217;re not impressive enough. The website suggests it&#8217;s 5x faster than an NVIDIA A100 unit on a large transformer model like BERT, while using about 15 percent of the energy. That makes the platform doubly attractive to deep-pocketed AI giants like Google and Amazon, which constantly require both more computing power and who pay through the nose for the energy required to use it. Either better performance or lower energy cost would be great — both together is irresistible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Lightmatter&#8217;s initial plan to test these units with its most likely customers by the end of 2021, refining it and bringing it up to production levels so it can be sold widely. But Harris emphasized this was essentially the Model T of their new approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re right, we just invented the next transistor,&#8221; he said, and for the purposes of large-scale computing, the claim is not without merit. You&#8217;re not going to have a miniature photonic computer in your hand any time soon, but in datacenters, where as much as 10 percent of the world&#8217;s power is predicted to go by 2030, &#8220;they really have unlimited appetite.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The color of math</h2>

<p>There are two main ways by which Lightmatter plans to improve the capabilities of its photonic computers. The first, and most insane sounding, is processing in different colors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so wild when you think about how these computers actually work. Transistors, which have been at the heart of computing for decades, use electricity to perform logic operations, opening and closing gates and so on. At a macro scale you can have different frequencies of electricity that can be manipulated like waveforms, but at this smaller scale it doesn&#8217;t work like that. You just have one form of currency, electrons, and gates are either open or closed.</p>
<p>In Lightmatter&#8217;s devices, however, light passes through waveguides that perform the calculations as it goes, simplifying (in some ways) and speeding up the process. And light, as we all learned in science class, comes in a variety of wavelengths — all of which can be <em>used independently and simultaneously on the same hardware.</em></p>
<p>The same optical magic that lets a signal sent from a blue laser be processed at the speed of light works for a red or a green laser with minimal modification. And if the light waves don&#8217;t interfere with one another, they can travel through the same optical components at the same time without losing any coherence.</p>
<p>That means that if a Lightmatter chip can do, say, a million calculations a second using a red laser source, adding another color doubles that to two million, adding another makes three — with very little in the way of modification needed. The chief obstacle is getting lasers that are up to the task, Harris said. Being able to take roughly the same hardware and near-instantly double, triple, or 20x the performance makes for a nice roadmap.</p>
<p>It also leads to the second challenge the company is working on clearing away, namely <em>interconnect</em>. Any supercomputer is composed of many small individual computers, thousands and thousands of them, working in perfect synchrony. In order for them to do so, they need to communicate constantly to make sure each core knows what other cores are doing, and otherwise coordinate the immensely complex computing problems supercomputing is designed to take on. (Intel talks about this &#8220;concurrency&#8221; problem building an exa-scale supercomputer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/intel-and-argonne-national-lab-on-exascale-and-their-new-aurora-supercomputer/">here</a>.)</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve learned along the way is, how do you get these chips to talk to each other when they get to the point where they&#8217;re so fast that they&#8217;re just sitting there waiting most of the time?&#8221; said Harris. The Lightmatter chips are doing work so quickly that they can&#8217;t rely on traditional computing cores to coordinate between them.</p>
<p>A photonic problem, it seems, requires a photonic solution: a wafer-scale interconnect board that uses waveguides instead of fiber optics to transfer data between the different cores. Fiber connections aren&#8217;t exactly slow, of course, but they aren&#8217;t infinitely fast, and the fibers themselves are actually fairly bulky at the scales chips are designed, limiting the number of channels you can have between cores.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the optics, the waveguides, into the chip itself; we can fit 40 waveguides into the space of a single optical fiber,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;That means you have way more lanes operating in parallel — it gets you to absurdly high interconnect speeds.&#8221; (Chip and server fiends can find that specs <a href="https://lightmatter.co/products/passage/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The optical interconnect board is called Passage, and will be part of a future generation of its Envise products — but as with the color calculation, it&#8217;s for a future generation. 5-10x performance at a fraction of the power will have to satisfy their potential customers for the present.</p>
<h2>Putting that $80M to work</h2>
<p>Those customers, initially the &#8220;hyper-scale&#8221; data handlers that already own datacenters and supercomputers that they&#8217;re maxing out, will be getting the first test chips later this year. That&#8217;s where the B round is primarily going, Harris said: &#8220;We&#8217;re funding our early access program.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means both building hardware to ship (very expensive per unit before economies of scale kick in, not to mention the present difficulties with suppliers) and building the go-to-market team. Servicing, support, and the immense amount of software that goes along with something like this — there&#8217;s a lot of hiring going on.</p>
<p>The round itself was led by Viking Global Investors, with participation from HP Enterprise, Lockheed Martin, SIP Global Partners, and previous investors GV, Matrix Partners and Spark Capital. It brings their total raised to about $113 million; There was the initial $11M A round, then GV hopping on with a $22M A-1, then this $80M.</p>
<p>Although there are other companies pursuing photonic computing and its potential applications in neural networks especially, Harris didn&#8217;t seem to feel that they were nipping at Lightmatter&#8217;s heels. Few if any seem close to shipping a product, and at any rate this is a market that is in the middle of its hockey stick moment. He pointed to an OpenAI study indicating that the demand for AI-related computing is increasing far faster than existing technology can provide it, except with ever larger datacenters.</p>
<p>The next decade will bring economic and political pressure to rein in that power consumption, just as we&#8217;ve seen with the cryptocurrency world, and Lightmatter is poised and ready to provide an efficient, powerful alternative to the usual GPU-based fare.</p>
<p>As Harris suggested hopefully earlier, what his company has made is potentially transformative in the industry and if so there&#8217;s no hurry — if there&#8217;s a gold rush, they&#8217;ve already staked their claim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m going to be honest with you: It was kind of a slow week for robotics news. Honestly, that’s the first time I can say that since I started doing this thing weekly (happy 10 weeks to us, by the way). Of course, this stuff always ebbs and flows to a certain extent &#8212; even during what’s been a particularly active stretch in robotics investments.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, the $56 million Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/path-robotics-raises-56m-series-b-for-automated-welding/"> for Path Robotics</a> is the big news of the week. And, indeed, it’s a sizeable round for the Columbus, Ohio-based company. It’s certainly cool seeing a big win for robots in the Midwest &#8212; particularly ones that fit pretty nicely into the manufacturing mold.</p>
<p>The company specializes in welding robotics &#8212; one in a long list of manufacturing jobs with a shortage of available workers. The company cites the American Welding Society, which puts the shortage potentially as high as 400,000 by the year 2024. Interest is also being driven by the pandemic, as more companies are looking for ways to move some of the process back to U.S. shores.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Speaking of manufacturing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/symbio-is-working-with-toyota-and-nissan-to-increase-robotic-assembly-efficiency/">I spoke to a company</a> called Symbio Robotics, way back in February. The big news then was that the Bay Area-based startup with partnering with Nissan and Toyota. Now it adds yet another massive automotive name to the list <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005302/en/Symbio-Robotics---The-Tech-Behind-Ford-Motor-Company%E2%80%99s-AI-enabled-Assembly-Line">with the addition of Ford</a>. The U.S. car giant has been making a lot of investments in robotics across the board in recent years.</p>
<p>“As the mobility landscape continues to rapidly change there is an increasing demand for much faster product life cycles,” Ford’s Advanced Controls and Digital Factory Manager Harry Kekedjian said in a release. “Using the Symbio technology, we’ve observed a 15% improvement in cycle time and greater than 50% reduction in adapting to new products over the previous manufacturing method.”</p>

<p>We haven’t written a ton about Miso Robotics lately &#8212; at least not since the company announced a partnership with Harold and Kumar’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/white-castle-rolls-out-more-robots-from-miso-robotics-to-cook-in-its-kitchens/">old haunt back in October</a>.

This week, the company announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miso-robotics-announces-cookright-software-as-a-standalone-offering-to-increase-accuracy-in-kitchens-301282845.html">CookRight software platform</a>, which combines a touchscreen tablet with thermal imaging &#8212; basically it sends similar food prep instructions as the ones it would deliver to Flippy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ace.games">Ace Games</a>, a Turkish mobile gaming company founded by a former Peak Games co-founder, has raised a $7 million Seed funding round led by Actera Group. Co-investment has come from San Francisco’s NFX. Former gaming entrepreneurs Kristian Segerstrale, Alexis Bonte, and Kaan Gunay also participated. Firat Ileri is previous investors from the pre-seed round.</p>
<p>The company runs two studios, one focused on casual and one on &#8216;hyper-casual&#8217; games.</p>
<p>Co-founded by CEO Hakan Bas, the former Co-Founder, and COO at Peak Games, Ace Games has had some success on the US iOS Store with its hyper-casual title, ‘Mix and Drink.’</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Bas said: “Ace’s main focus is actually the casual ‘hybrid puzzle’ game that we have been working on for a while now. However, our hyper-casual studio assists the main studio in many aspects like training talent, coming up with creative game mechanics and marketing ideas, generating cash, and creating user base.” Ace’s casual title is to be released late-summer this year and the global launch is expected in early 2022.</p>
<p>Peak Games, Gram Games and Rollic Games were all acquired by Zynga, showing that Turkey is capable of producing decent exits for gaming startups.</p>
<p>VCs such as Index, Balderton, Makers and Griffin have all made M&amp;A  deals with Dream Games, Bigger Games and Spyke Games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For every crypto-skeptic that see NFTs as yet another hype bubble, there&#8217;s an acolyte who sees NFTs as the key to unlocking the future of the creative web.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitski.com/">Bitski</a>, an SF-based startup that builds custom NFT storefronts for brands and creators, is banking on the latter and they have new investors betting the same. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $19 million in a Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. The firm joins a host of creators and celebrities including Jay Z, MrBeast, Serena Willliams and 3LAU in backing the startup.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The NFT space has gotten awfully crowded lately, riding a wave of investor hype and billions of dollars worth of transactions in the past several months. While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">high-dollar artwork sold by artists like Beeple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">exclusive crypto communities like CryptoPunks</a> have been hotbeds of activity, founders like those behind Bitski believe that these blockchain-backed digital goods are going to inspire a massive transformation in how artists, influencers and brands monetize their online popularity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bitski is aiming to allow mainstream brands and celebrities to bypass the crypto complexity of early marketplaces, hoping to give customers like early partner Adidas an on-ramp to the NFT world that&#8217;s more approachable to consumers who understand digital items but might not have fully bought into crypto. The startup sells creators a variety of subscription plans to power custom NFT storefronts that they can sell through as their own channel rather than pushing users to wide-ranging marketplaces. </span></p>
<p>There are plenty of arguments among builders and users of NFT platforms surrounding which elements of a service should be blockchain-based and which should default to more time-honed e-commerce flows. Bitski often errs on the side of user familiarity, allowing credit card purchases on the platform, &#8220;forgot your password&#8221; functionality and user wallets hosted on Bitski&#8217;s own server hardware. They&#8217;re controversial onboarding choices that won&#8217;t satisfy crypto purists and decentralization advocates but will likely help new users get acquainted with NFTs quickly.</p>
<p>With the company&#8217;s Series A closed, Bitski has raised some $23.4 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic of compensation has historically been a delicate one that has left many people &#8212; especially startup employees &#8212; wondering just what drives what can feel like random decisions around pay and equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, software engineers (and housemates) Miles Hobby and Geoffrey Tisserand set about trying to solve the problem for companies by developing a data-driven platform that aims to help companies structure their compensation plans and transparently communicate them to candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now today, the startup behind that platform, Figure, announced it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by CRV. Bling Capital, Better Tomorrow Ventures and Garage Capital also participated in the financing, along with angel investors such as AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, Jason Calacanis, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and other executives based in Silicon Valley.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has amassed a client list that includes other startups such as fintechs Brex and NerdWallet and AI-powered fitness company Tempo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Hobby and Tisserand’s mission is to improve workflows and transparency around pay, particularly equity. The pair had both worked at startups themselves (Uber and Instacart, respectively) and ended up leaving money on the table when they left those companies because no one had properly explained to them what their equity, which changed at every valuation, meant.  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148277" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148277" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148277 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148277" class="wp-caption-text">Figure co-founders and co-CEOs Miles Hobby and Geoffrey Tisserand. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Figure</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, one of their goals was to create a solution that would provide a user-friendly explanation of what a person’s equity stake really means, from tax implications to whether or not they have to buy the stock and/or hold onto it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve gone through the job search process many times before and there’s all these complex legal documents to understand why you’re getting 10,000 stock options, but obviously we knew the vast majority of people have no idea how that works,” Tisserand told TechCrunch. “We saw an opportunity there to help companies actually convey the value to their candidates while also making them aware of the potential risks of owning something that’s so illiquid.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148280" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148280" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148280 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png" alt="" width="624" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148280" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Figure</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another goal of Figure’s is to help create a more fair and balanced process about decisions around pay and equity so that there’s less inequality out there. Pointedly, it aims to remove some of the biases that exist around those decisions by systematizing the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw a void in this kind of context around equity&#8230;and knew that there had to be a better way for companies to structure, manage and explain their compensation plans,” Hobby said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Hobby and Tisserand, Figure is designed to help stop instances of implicit bias.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Compensation should be based on the work that you’re doing, and not gender or ethnic background,” Tisserand told TechCrunch. “We’re trying to give that context and remove biases. So, we’re trying to help at two different stages –– to surface inequities that already exist and make sure there are no anomalies, and then to help stop them before they can exist.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure also aims to give companies the tools to educate candidates and employees on their total compensation — including equity, salary, benefits and bonuses — in a “straightforward and user-friendly” way. For example, it can create custom offer letters that interactively detail a candidate’s compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is for Figure to become an operating system for compensation, where a company can encode their compensation philosophy into our system, and we help them determine their job architecture, compensation bands and offer numbers while monitoring their compensation health to provide adjustment suggestions when needed,” Hobby said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-hire, Figure’s compensation management system “helps keep everything running smoothly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Khan, general partner of enterprise software at CRV, is joining Figure’s board as part of the funding. The decision to back the startup was in part personal, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d been investing in software for eight years and was alarmed that no one was building anything around pay equity when it comes to how we’re paid, why we’re paid what we’re paid and on how to build equity long term,” Khan told TechCrunch. “Unfortunately, discussions around compensation and equity still happen behind closed doors and this extends into workflow around compensation &#8212; equally broken &#8212; with manual leveling, old data and large pay inequities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its product offerings and scale its organization.</span></p>

But right now, tracking things like your company’s CO2 emissions is mainly the preserve of large corporations. Now a startup hopes to address this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.diginex-solutions.com/">Diginex Solutions</a> has a self-guided tool which claims to generate ESG reports six times faster than competitors and comes in at a relatively affordable $99 per month.</p>
<p>The blockchain-enabled reporting tool also generates reports, giving companies the ability to demonstrate their ESG creds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DiginexESG is certified by the GRI, an international independent standards organization and now operates in the US, UK, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chile. It is currently raising venture backing largely from strategic corporate investors.</p>
<p>Competitors include Turnkey Group, NASDAQ Onereport, Enablon (raised $15M) and World-favour.</p>
<p>Mark Blick, CEO at Diginex Solutions said, “The current landscape of ESG reporting is challenging for many organizations &#8211; particularly SMEs &#8211; requiring huge consultancy fees, time and resources that distracts from day-to-day activity. The DiginexESG platform quite simply takes away those challenges and does all the heavy lifting for them. It’s like Docusign, Dropbox, TurboTax or Slack hardcoded for ESG reporting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicles rely on many sensors to perceive the world around them, and while cameras and lidar get a lot of the attention, good old radar is an important piece of the puzzle — though it has some fundamental limitations. <a href="https://www.oculii.com/">Oculii</a>, which just raised a $55M round, aims to minimize those limitations and make radar more capable with a smart software layer for existing devices — and sell its own as well.</p>
<p>Radar&#8217;s advantages lie in its superior range, and in the fact that its radio frequency beams can pass through things like raindrops, snow, and fog — making it crucial for perceiving the environment during inclement weather. Lidar and ordinary visible light cameras can be totally flummoxed by these common events, so it&#8217;s necessary to have a backup.</p>
<p>But radar&#8217;s major disadvantage is that, due to the wavelengths and how the antennas work, it can&#8217;t image things in detail the way lidar can. You tend to get very precisely located blobs rather than detailed shapes. It still provides invaluable capabilities in a suite of sensors, but if anyone could add a bit of extra fidelity to its scans, it would be that much better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Oculii does — take an ordinary radar and supercharge it. The company claims a 100x improvement to spatial resolution accomplished by handing over control of the system to its software. Co-founder and CEO Steven Hong explained in an email that a standard radar might have, for a 120 degree field of view, a 10 degree spatial resolution, so it can tell where something is with a precision of a few degrees on either side, and little or no ability to tell the object&#8217;s elevation.</p>
<p>Some are better, some worse, but for the purposes of this example that amounts to an effectively 12&#215;1 resolution. Not great!</p>
<p>Handing over control to the Oculii system, however, which intelligently adjusts the transmissions based on what it&#8217;s already perceiving, could raise that to a 0.5° horizonal x 1° vertical resolution, giving it an effective resolution of perhaps 120&#215;10. (Again, these numbers are purely for explanatory purposes and aren&#8217;t inherent to the system.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge improvement and results in the ability to see that something is, for example, two objects near each other and not one large one, or that an object is smaller than another near it, or — with additional computation — that it is moving one way or the other at such and such a speed relative to the radar unit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video demonstration of one of their own devices, showing considerably more detail than one would expect:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/503276130" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Exactly how this is done is part of Oculii&#8217;s proprietary magic, and Hong did not elaborate much on how exactly the system works. &#8220;Oculii’s sensor uses AI to adaptively generate an &#8216;intelligent&#8217; waveform that adapts to the environment and embed information across time that can be leveraged to improve the resolution significantly,&#8221; he said. (Integrating information over time is what gives it the &#8220;4D&#8221; moniker, by the way.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little sizzle reel that gives a very general idea:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/505229486" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Autonomous vehicle manufacturers have not yet hit on any canonical set of sensors that AVs should have, but something like Oculii could give radar a more prominent place — its limitations sometimes mean it is relegated to emergency braking detection at the front or some such situation. With more detail and more data, radar could play a larger role in AV decisionmaking systems.</p>
<p>The company is definitely making deals — it&#8217;s working with Tier-1s and OEMs, one of which (Hella) is an investor, which gives a sense of confidence in Oculii&#8217;s approach. It&#8217;s also working with radar makers and has some commercial contracts looking at a 2024-2025 timeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148310" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148310" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2148310" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg" alt="CG render of Oculii's two radar units." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2148310" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Oculii</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also getting into making its own all-in-one radar units, doing the hardware-software synergy thing. It claims these are the world&#8217;s highest resolution radars, and I don&#8217;t see any competitors out there contradicting this — the simple fact is radars don&#8217;t compete much on &#8220;resolution,&#8221; but more on the precision of their rangefinding and speed detection.</p>
<p>One exception might be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/">Echodyne</a>, which uses a metamaterial radar surface to direct a customizable radar beam anywhere in its field of view, examining objects in detail or scanning the whole area quickly. But even then its &#8220;resolution&#8221; isn&#8217;t so easy to estimate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A3mqolYw05"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/">Echodyne steers its high-tech radar beam on autonomous cars with EchoDrive</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Echodyne steers its high-tech radar beam on autonomous cars with EchoDrive&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/embed/#?secret=A3mqolYw05" data-secret="A3mqolYw05" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At any rate the company&#8217;s new Eagle and Falcon radars might be tempting to manufacturers working on putting together cutting-edge sensing suites for their autonomous experiments or production driver-assist systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that with radar tipped as a major component of autonomous vehicles, robots, aircraft and other devices, it&#8217;s worth investing seriously in the space. The $55M B round certainly demonstrates that well enough. It was, as Oculii&#8217;s press release lists it, &#8220;co-led by Catapult Ventures and Conductive Ventures, with participation from Taiwania Capital, Susquehanna Investment Group (SIG), HELLA Ventures, PHI-Zoyi Capital, R7 Partners, VectoIQ, ACVC Partners, Mesh Ventures, Schox Ventures, and Signature Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money will allow for the expected scaling and hiring, and as Hong added, &#8220;continued investment of the technology to deliver higher resolution, longer range, more compact and cheaper sensors that will accelerate an autonomous future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rechargepayments.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of subscription management software for e-commerce, announced today that it has raised $227 million in a Series B growth round at a $2.1 billion valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit Partners, ICONIQ Growth and Bain Capital Ventures provided the capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Santa Monica, California-based ReCharge was bootstrapped for several years before raising $50 million in a previously undisclosed Series A from Summit Partners in January of 2020. And, it’s currently cash flow positive, according to company execs. With this round, ReCharge has raised a total of $277 million in funding.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the company&#8217;s SaaS platform has evolved from a subscription billing/payments platform to include a broader set of offerings aimed at helping e-commerce businesses boost revenues and cut operating costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, ReCharge&#8217;s cloud-based software is designed to give e-commerce merchants a way to offer and manage subscriptions for physical products. It also aims to help these brands, primarily direct to consumer companies, grow by providing them with ways to “easily” add subscription offerings to their business with the goal of turning one-time purchasers “into loyal, repeat customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has some impressive growth metrics, no doubt in part driven by the COVID-19 pandemic’s push to all things digital. ReCharge’s ARR grew 146% in 2020, while revenue grew over 136% over the same period, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Oisin O’Connor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although he declined to reveal hard numbers. The startup has 15,000 customers and 20 million subscribers across 180 countries on its platform. Customers include Harry’s, Oatly, Fiji Water, Billie and Native. But even prior to the pandemic, it had doubled its processing volume each year for the past five years and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">processed over $5.3 billion in transactions since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge also has 328 employees, up from 140 in January of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw many brick and mortar stores, such as Oatly, offer their products through subscriptions as a result of the pandemic in 2020,” O’Connor told TechCrunch. “Certain categories such as food &amp; beverage and pet foods were some of the fastest growing segments in total subscriber count, with 100% and 147% increases, respectively, as non-discretionary spending shifted online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was surprised to see that growth also extend beyond the most obvious categories. For example, ReCharge saw beauty care products subscribers grow by 120% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, we saw a 91% subscriber growth in 2020 across the board in all categories of subscriptions,” O’Connor told TechCrunch. “We believe there is a combination of factors at play: the pandemic, the rise of physical subscriptions and the rise of direct-to-consumer buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge plans to use its fresh capital to accelerate hiring in both R&amp;D (engineering and product) and go-to-market functions such as sales, marketing and customer success. It plans to continue its expansion into other e-commerce platforms such as BigCommerce, Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Magento, and outside of North America into other geographic markets, starting with Europe. ReCharge also plans to “broaden” its acquisition scope so that it can “accelerate” its time-to-market in certain domains, according to O’Connor, and of course build upon its products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoonkee Sull, partner at ICONIQ Growth, said his firm has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching the rapid rise of subscription commerce for several years “as more merchants have looked for ways to deepen relationships with loyal customers and consumers increasingly have sought out more convenient and flexible ways to buy from their favorite brands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, ICONIQ is betting on its belief that ReCharge “will continue to take significant share in a fast-growing market,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sull believes the ReCharge team identified the subscription e-commerce opportunity early on and addresses the numerous nuanced needs of the market with “a fully-featured product that uniquely enables both the smallest merchants and largest brands to easily adopt and scale with their platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Collins, managing director at Summit Partners, was impressed that the company saw so much growth without external capital for years, due to its “efficiency and discipline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ReCharge team identified a true </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product-market fit and built a product that customers love &#8212; which has fueled strong organic growth as the business has scaled,” Collins added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal today announced the launch of wood 3D printing tool, Forust. Founded in 2019, the company specializes in 3D printing for interior design. The company’s “non-destructive” printing methods have managed to largely fly under the radar, with minimal press coverage until now &#8212; making them a pretty ideal acquisition candidate.</p>
<p>In fact, the gross assets acquisition actually occurred back in October 2020, according to a filing, which pegs it at a price at $2.5 million, including $2 million in cash considerations. Since then, it seems, the two have been working together ahead of an official launch.</p>
<p>In a press release issued today, Desktop Metal is positioning Forust as the name of the new manufacturing process now in the company’s portfolio. The technology utilizes cellulose dust and lignin, byproducts from the wood and paper industries, respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2148444" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148444" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2148444" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Desktopmetal_4_1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148444" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Desktop Metal</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As part of Desktop Metal, Forust is empowering architects, designers, and manufacturers to leverage design-forward technology to rethink how wood waste streams are used &#8212; whether you’re looking to manufacture one, one thousand or one million pieces,” Forust co-founder and CEO Andrew Jeffery tells TechCrunch. “Forust has the ability to bring 3D-printed, sustainable wood designs to life for businesses and consumers to create beautiful, sturdy wood products to support various industries, such as interior design, furniture and consumer home goods.”</p>
<p>Starting today, the companies will offer samples and designs online. The list of products includes architectural accents, pieces of furniture and home products like bowls and flower pots.</p>

<p>“Applications for Forust’s wood parts are really limitless,” said Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop, says in a press release. “There are many applications where polymers and plastics are used today where you can now cost-effectively replace with sustainably manufactured wood parts &#8212; luxurious high-end components in interiors, consumer electronics, instruments, aviation, boats, home goods and eventually in flooring and exterior roofing applications.”</p>
<p>In addition to Forust, the same filing reveals that the company also purchased the &#8220;single acquired technology asset&#8221; of Figur Machine Tools, a sheet metal printing company, for $3.5 million. In August, Desktop Metal announced it was going public via a SPAC that valued it at $2.5 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking isn’t simple for at least <a href="https://identifythesigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ASHA_Identify-the-Signs_Fact-Sheet-Final.pdf">40 million Americans</a>, so a new Austin-based startup is scaling a solution. <a href="https://www.expressable.io/">Expressable</a> is a digital speech therapy company that connects patients to speech language pathologists (SLP) via telehealth services and asynchronous support, and it has raised a new $4.5 million seed round.</p>
<p>The early-stage startup is launching with an explicit focus on serving the approximately five million children in the United States that have a communication disorder. What might start as an occasional stutter could turn into a communication disorder over time &#8211; so the startup is looking to intervene early to get kids on a clearer path.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019 by married co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-barbara-7735bb61/">Nicholas Barbara</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-sherred/">Leanne Sherred</a>, Expressable has served thousands of families to date. Today, the duo announced its seed funding, co-led by Lerer Hippeau and NextView Ventures, with participation from Amplifyher Ventures. The money will be used to expand its provider network, go in-network, and focus on its edtech service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>
<p>Put simply, Expressable connects children to speech-language pathologists on a recurring basis. The therapy is done live via<a href="https://zoom.us/healthcare"> Zoom for Healthcare</a> with licensed professionals that Expresssable employs full-time. Clients are matched with a therapist in their area of need, from public speaking to vocal cord paralysis. Parents are able to reach their children’s SLP through secure SMS for coordination, questions, and rescheduling throughout the week.</p>
<p>On top of real-time support, the virtual speech therapy provider has a suite of asynchronous services. The company is building an e-learning platform with homework assignments and lessons, prescribed by the therapist and provided via SMS, for parents to do with their children to reinforce the speech care plans.</p>
<p>The activities are meant to be bite-sized &#8211; used when driving to the grocery store or cooking dinner or playing in the backyard &#8211; and tailored for interaction with children. The lessons can be as simple as creating opportunities for a kid to ask for juice, or to practice two-word utterances with an imitation game.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148126" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148126" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2148126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png" alt="" width="264" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png 1251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=1024,2048 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Secure-SMS.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148126" class="wp-caption-text">A mock secure SMS by Expressable. <strong> Image Credits: Expressable </strong></p></div></p>
<p>This unique edtech bit of Expressable leans heavily on parent involvement in the therapy process. Parental help has been shown to increase positive outcomes, but notably it could also leave low-income, working class families out of the mix. Its price, on average, is $59 per week, and that’s currently only out of pocket rather than subsidized by insurance.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of content for speech language pathologists by speech language pathologists, but not a lot of content by [SLPs] for parents, written in a way that is consumable,” Barbara said. “It just felt like a huge opportunity and market gap.”</p>
<p>Part of Expressable’s value is that it’s better than the status quo, which surprisingly often actually amounts to nothing. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, about 8 to 9 percent of children have a speech sound disorder in the country &#8212; but only half actually get treatment. What might start as an occasional stutter could turn into a communication disorder over time &#8211; so Expressable wants to intervene early to get kids on the right path.</p>
<p>“Public schools are the number-one provider for pediatric speech but they are unfortunately notoriously underfunded,” said Sherred. Children who are lucky enough to be eligible for school services are often provided them in a group setting, she continued, which lengthens the amount of time it takes to make progress.</p>
<p>Sherred witnessed the “incredibly frustrating cycle” created by gaps in school intervention first-hand as a SLP. She has spent the majority of her career in in-home health, where she would work in homes and daycares directly with children.</p>
<p>The majority of Expressable’s user base are children, but about 35% are adults, signaling how speech issues can continue past childhood.</p>
<p>Meagen Lloyst, who sourced the Expressabble deal for Lerer Hippeau, is one example. Lloyst was diagnosed with a speech and voice condition in late 2020 and needed to find remote SLP therapy, which introduced her to the challenges of finding a high-quality specialized SLP.</p>
<p>“Before Expressable, there was no consumer-facing brand out there solving these pain points for individuals with communications disorders,” Lloyst said. “It&#8217;s evident that they&#8217;re already hiring the best SLPs out there, bringing parents and education into the process to focus on better outcomes for children, and doing so in a cost-effective and convenient way through virtual care.”</p>
<h2><strong>Telehealth with a twist</strong></h2>
<p>While telehealth usage remains above pre-pandemic levels, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/01/telehealth-visits-decline-covid19-hospitals/">visits are on the decline.</a> One challenge for any digital telehealth startup, Expressable included, is how to make a convincing pitch for moving caretaking fully-virtual in a post-pandemic context.</p>
<p>The Expressable co-founders pointed toward consistency, both internally and externally, as a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>First, speech therapy is a recurring service that many patients use once a week, every month, for years. “A lot of other telemedicine plays are these quick, convenient, and direct primary care,” Barbara said. “[We are] a longer tail of treatment plan that requires a close relationship between provider and patient.”</p>
<p>Second, unlike many telehealth startups, Expressable has hired its specialists full-time as W-2 employees. It’s a strategic choice to help ensure to its clients that their SLP of choice is a long-term relationship. The startup has 50 W-2 SLPs currently.</p>

<p>“We have built a career path for SLPs and a value proposition to speech language pathologists where they can work from home, set their own hours [get] paid above the national average, and then receive benefits that may not be obviously not common if you&#8217;re working in a contractor position.”</p>
<p>Not relying on the traditional contractor model might be a differentiation, but it’s also a challenge. The startup will have to rapidly (and efficiently) hire SLPs for the variety of speaking conditions out there &#8211; and in order to expand into new markets, it has to go through the arduous legal process of local licensing requirements, instead of just going to a white-label solution that helps staff similar companies while offloading individual practitioner certification.</p>
<p>While it has ambitions to become a national practice, Expressable currently operates in 15 states, and employs SLPs that are licensed in all the states that it operates in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s widely known that video streaming boomed during the pandemic, as millions of people were faced by boredom during lockdowns. But an unintended consequence of this was the growing environmental impact of millions of video streams which meant server farms needing to draw increasing amounts of power from the grid. Indeed, there were even calls for people to cycle down to Standard Definition, as HD streaming has a greater impact. But it turns out that if you optimize the video, you can reduce the bitrate required, reducing the data and energy needed.</p>
<p>Oddly enough this is also the pitch of the famed satirical show, Silicon Valley, where fictional startup PiedPiper invents a new creates an app that contains a revolutionary data compression algorithm for video.</p>
<p>But this scenario may about to become fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.isize.co/">iSIZE</a>, UK startup which applies deep learning to optimize video streaming and delivery, has $6.3 million in a funding round led by Octopus Ventures, with participation from existing investors including TD Veen and Patrick Pichette, Chairman of Twitter and ex-CFO of Google. The company has now raised a total of $8.2 million.</p>
<p>iSIZE’s BitSave technology optimizes video streaming quality while reducing bitrate requirements, &#8220;allowing for a significant reduction in data and energy consumption&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is trained to ‘see with the human eye’ in order to n=make the video still look high quality, but reduce the bitrate needed. It integrates with all video encoding standards (including AVC, HEVC, and AV1) without needing changes to the streaming process. In other words, the links of Netflix, etc would, says the company, be able to install the iSize solution relatively easily.</p>
<p>Founded by Sergio Grce and Dr. Yiannis Andreopoulos, the team combines R&amp;D in machine learning, neural networks, and video signal processing, and is a graduate of the Creative Destruction Lab Oxford 2019-2020 program.</p>
<p>Sergio Grce, Founder and CEO of iSIZE, commented: “Today there are more people streaming more video than ever before. Our customers recognize both the commercial opportunity and their social responsibility to optimize their video delivery pipelines with our pioneering technology.”</p>
<p>On a call to me, he added: &#8220;The processing optimizes for human perception and tries to reverse engineer human perception of the receiver in a manner similar to psycho visual perception. So that saves bitrate and the content looks the same or better on the client device. We are doing something similar for video as what the MP3 did for music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon King, Partner and deep tech investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “The technology iSIZE has created is pioneering and is already being used by some of the world’s largest companies to reduce the costs and energy used in streaming. Consumer demand for high-quality video is only going to increase as our devices are upgraded, so it’s vital that we find new ways to reduce the environmental impact.”</p>
<p>iSIZE&#8217;s competitors include Wave 1 and Deep Render.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let&#8217;s remind ourselves of how good PiedPiper was at video compression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech investments in emerging markets have been in full swing over the past couple of years and their ecosystems have thrived as a result.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these markets like Africa, Latin America, and India, have comprehensive reports by publications and firms on trends and investments in their individual regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s hardly a report to compare and contrast trends and investments between these regions and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such a task is Herculean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, a <a href="https://bfaglobal.com/catalyst-fund/briter-catalyst-fund-state-of-the-fintech-industry-report/?utm_source=briter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=fintech_report">report</a> released today by data research organization </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and global inclusive tech accelerator </span><a href="https://bfaglobal.com/project/catalyst-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is punching above its weight to offer a holistic representation to the darling sector of these three markets: fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report &#8220;State of Fintech in Emerging Markets Report&#8221; has three objectives &#8212; to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the investment, product, and inclusivity trends across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team surveyed over 177 startups and 33 investors across Africa, Latin America, and India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though this sample size used is minuscule, the key findings are quite impressive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s dive in.</span></p>
<h2>Fintechs have raised $23B across the regions since 2017</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no stopping emerging markets&#8217; favorite. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sector has continued to receive the largest share of investments year-on-year for the past five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 300 million unbanked African adults account for 17% of the world&#8217;s unbanked population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s not difficult to see why in 2019, the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five mega deals in Branch, Tala, World Remit, Interswitch, and OPay that amounted to a total of over $775 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this dropped last year to $362 million, companies like Flutterwave, TymeBank, Kuda have raised sizeable rounds during this period</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is home to a growing base of digital users, enabling regulation and reforms, and vibrant small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Africa, the percentage of unbanked people is high at 70%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs in the region have seized the opportunity and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been rewarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with mega-rounds that companies like NuBank, Neon, Konfio, and Clip have enjoyed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fintech startups have raised $10 billion in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019 alone, Indian fintech startups raised a record of $4.8 billion, per the report. Then last year, the sector brought in $3 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, they have totaled $11.6 billion with notable big names like CRED, Razorpay, Groww, BharatPe, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s average seed rounds stand at $1M, India and Latin America average $4M</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, early-stage deals in Africa have been increasing over the past five years totaling over $1.6 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their average size, especially for seed rounds, has grown from $750,000 in 2017 to $1 million in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For  Latin America, the average seed deal in the last five years was around $5.7 million while India did approximately $4.6 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The report says the data for the latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was skewed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of CRED&#8217;s $30 million seed round.</span></p>

<h2>Latin America is IPO-hungry, India breeds unicorns while Africa is just getting started with M&amp;A</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Stripe&#8217;s acquisition of Paystack was the highlight of Africa&#8217;s M&amp;As because of its size and the homegrown status of the Nigerian fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other larger rounds that made the headlines include the $500 million acquisition of Wave by WorldRemit (which happens to be the largest from the continent) and the DPO Group buyout by Network International for $288 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the African fintech market that has noticed mega acquisition deals and many undisclosed seven-figure deals, the Latin American fintech market is a sucker for IPOs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, fintechs in the region have several $100 million rounds (Nubank, PagSeguro,  Creditas, BancoInter and Neon) and M&amp;A activity is sparse. But a number of them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have gone public recently including Arco Educacao, Stone Pagamentos, and Pagseguro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, India has more than 25 billion-dollar companies and keeps adding yearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, the country recorded more than eight. These unicorns range from established companies like Paytm and new ones like CRED.</span></p>
<h2>Payments, credit, and neobanks lead fintech activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report shows that payments companies are the crème de la crème for fintech investment across the three regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within that subset, B2B payments reign supreme. The next two funded fintech categories are credit and digital banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, payments startups have seen more investments than credit and neobanks. Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, Wave, Paystack, DPO come to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America most funded fintechs are neobanks. And it is the only region with all three product categories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded at $2-3 billion each. Some of these companies include NuBank, Creditas, and dLocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India&#8217;s top-funded fintech startups are in payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has notable representation in credit and neobanks, some of which have raised nine-figure rounds like Niyo, Lendingkart, and InCred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Investors are enthused<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>about the future of insurance, payments, and digital banks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the handful of investors surveyed in the report on their view on future trends in fintech products 5 years from now, most of them chose insurance, payments, and digital banking models</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment platforms and embedded models are also areas of interest. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were less keen on agriculture and remittances while wealth tech platforms and neobanks were also ranked lower </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How is it that digital banking and neo-banking are at two ends of the spectrum of investor choice? I can&#8217;t say for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parts of the report talk about underserved consumers in these regions and how fintech startups are serving them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also discusses whether these fintech startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promote financial inclusion and what features and products would get them to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this, the glaring fact, which is no news, is that Africa is lagging years behind Latin America and India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with Briter Bridges director Dario Giuliani, he pointed out that he&#8217;d lean on five years for the continent to get to where Latin America and India are at the moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that what makes India a better market at this stage is because it isn&#8217;t a continent like the other markets and operations are uniform across board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is easier to manage one country than 54 countries in Africa and 20 in Latin America,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch. &#8220;In Africa, we use the label &#8216;Africa,&#8217; but we&#8217;re very much talking about 4-6 countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia who are seeing massive companies rise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. India is one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key detail the report mentions is that most fintechs across emerging markets are crossing over to different sectors like crop insurance, credit lines for distributors and vendors, KYC, e-commerce payment gateways, medical finance, and insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Guiliani says he expects this to continue.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic has been good for anything it&#8217;s been good for the therapy business and for startups targeting mental health, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">VCs kept very busy signing checks</a>. To wit, here&#8217;s another one: Madrid-based <a href="https://ifeelonline.com/en/">ifeel</a> has bagged €5.5 million (~$6.6M) in Series A funding, led by Nauta Capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded back in 2017 &#8212; initially as a consumer-focused therapy platform &#8212; but last year it pivoted to a hybrid business model, tapping into demand from businesses to offer staff emotional support during the public health crisis. So it&#8217;s available both to individuals via monthly subscription or as part of employer’s or insurance provider’s cover</p>
<p>It says that pandemic pivot has resulted in 1,000% growth in its b2b business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies it&#8217;s signed up to offer its platform to their staff include AXA Partners, Glovo and Gympass.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a total of 400K users on the platform (b2c and b2b),&#8221; says co-founder Amir Kaplan. &#8220;We have 100,000 eligible covered who have access to ifeel as a benefit (through our insurance and wellness partners or direct with ifeel).</p>
<p>&#8220;The 100K grew 10x from September 2020 and is the largest trend we are experiencing these days. Employees of 100 companies use ifeel on a weekly basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>ifeel&#8217;s platform delivers both live therapy sessions with licensed psychologists but also provides users with self-care tool such as daily mood trackers, recommended exercises and activities to expand the support available.</p>
<p>&#8220;By combining self-care and guided therapies, <span class="il">ifeel</span> maximises engagement and retention of its users &#8212; with 90% reporting improved emotional and mental well-being after using <span class="il">ifeel</span>,&#8221; it claims.</p>
<p>The startup is using AI technology in the self-care portion of its platform &#8212; to recommend &#8220;the most relevant&#8221; content or exercise to its users, per Kaplan. But he also says it&#8217;s looking at using the tech to assist the therapist practice by developing dedicated tools inside the platform.</p>
<p>ifeel has an international founding team, hailing from three countries (Israel, Italy and Mexico), and says its main markets so far are Spain, France, Brazil and Mexico. While its b2b and insurance network coverage extends to 20 countries and four languages (English, Spanish, French and Portuguese).</p>
<p>With so much competition in the mental health tools space &#8212; from mindfulness apps, to internet-delivered CBT programs, to therapy platforms &#8212; how does ifeel see itself standing out?</p>
<p>Kaplan suggests it has an advantage of being &#8220;global from day one&#8221;, and also flags a &#8220;strong technology integration focus&#8221; which he says has allowed it to plug into insurance companies and wellness players &#8212; to become a &#8220;main service provider&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very early we partnered with global leading companies and we support them in many countries (compared to specific country players like in Germany and UK,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The platform approach is different from &#8216;online therapy&#8217; companies or &#8216;mindfulness apps&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want our users to manage their emotional well being on our platform no matter the need. In this way we create millions of engagement events that are customized to the user’s needs and allow users over time to use different parts of our platform in different life situations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot</a>, the popular Oslo-based edtech company that has built a big business out of gamifiying education and creating a platform for users to build their own learning games, is making an acquisition to double down on K-12 education and its opportunities to grow in the U.S. It is acquiring <a href="https://clever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clever</a>, a startup that has built a single sign-on portal for educators, students and their families to build and engage in digital learning classrooms, currently used by about 65% of all U.S. K-12 schools. <a href="https://kahoot.com/press/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-accelerating-vision-leading-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kahoot said</a> that the deal &#8212; coming in a combination of cash and shares &#8212; gives Clever an enterprise value of between $435 million and $500 million, dependent on meeting certain performance milestones.</p>
<p>The plan will be to continue growing Clever&#8217;s business in the U.S. &#8212; which currently employs 175 people &#8212; as well as give it a lever for expanding globally alongside Kahoot&#8217;s wider stable of edtech software and services.</p>
<p>“Clever and Kahoot! are two purpose-led organizations that are equally passionate about education and unleashing the potential within every learner,” said Eilert Hanoa, CEO at Kahoot, in a statement. &#8220;Through this acquisition we see considerable potential to collaborate on education innovation to better service all our users – schools, teachers, students, parents and lifelong learners – and leveraging our global scale to offer Clever’s unique platform worldwide. I’m excited to welcome Tyler and his team to the Kahoot family.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news came on the same day that Kahoot, which is traded in Oslo with a <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/KAHOT.OL?p=KAHOT.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of $4.3 billion</a>, also <a href="https://kahoot.com/investor/announcements/kahoot-asa-reports-first-quarter-2021-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced strong Q1 results</a> in which it also noted it has closed its acquisition of Whiteboard.fi, a provider of whiteboard tools for teachers, for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The same tides that have been lifting Kahoot have also been playing out for Clever and other edtech companies.</p>
<p>The startup was originally incubated in Y Combinator and launched with a vision to be a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/clever-launches-twilio-for-ed-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio for education</a>&#8220;, which in its vision was to create a unified way of being able to tap into the myriad of student sign-on systems and educational databases to make it easier for those building edtech services to scale their products, and bring on more customers (schools, teachers, students, families) to use them. As with payments, financial services in general, and telecommunications, it turns out that education is also a pretty fragmented market, and Clever wanted to figure out a way to fix the complexity and put it behind an API to make it easier for others to tap into it.</p>
<p>Over time it built that out also with a marketplace (<a href="https://clever.com/app-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">application gallery</a> in its terminology) of some 600 software providers and application developers that integrate with its SSO, which in turn becomes a way for a school or district to subsequently expand the number of edtech tools that it can use. This has been especially critical in the last year as schools have been forced to close in-person learning and go entirely virtual to help stave off the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Clever has found a lot of traction for its approach both with schools, and investors. With the former, Clever says that it&#8217;s used by 89,000 schools and some 65% of K-12 school districts (13,000 overall) in the U.S., with that figure including 95 of the 100 largest school districts in the country. This works out to 20 million students logging in monthly and 5.6 billion learning sessions.</p>
<div class="content--max-width">
<div class="benefit--columns">
<div class="benefit--copy-column ">
<div class="benefit--column-copy text-black text-link-styles">
<p>The latter, meanwhile, has seen the company raise from a pretty impressive range of investors, including YC current and former partners like Paul Graham and Sam Altman, GSV, Founders Fund, Lightspeed and Sequoia. It raised just under $60 million, which may sound modest these days but remember that it&#8217;s been around since 2012, when edtech was not so cool and attention-grabbing, and hasn&#8217;t raised money since 2016, which in itself is a sign that it&#8217;s doing something right as a business.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kahoot noted that Clever projects $44 million in billed revenues for 2021, with annual revenue growth rate of approximately 25% CAGR in the last three years, and it has been running the business on &#8220;a cash flow neutral basis, redeploying all cash into development of its offerings,&#8221; Kahoot noted.</p>
<p>Kahoot itself has had a strong year driven in no small part by the pandemic and the huge boost that resulted in remote learning and remote work. It noted in its results that it had 28 million active accounts in the last twelve months representing 68% growth on the year before, with the number of hosted games in that period at 279 million (up 28%) with more than 1.6 billion participants of those games (up 24%). Paid subscriptions in Q1 were at 760,000, with 255,000 using the &#8220;work&#8221; (B2B) tier; 275,000 school accounts; and 230,000 thousand in its &#8220;home and study&#8221; category. Annual recurring revenue is now at $69 million ($18 million a year ago for the same quarter), while actual revenue for the quarter was $16.2 million (up from $4.2 million a year ago), growing 284%.</p>
<p>The company, which is also backed by the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/14/disney-kahoot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney</a>, Microsoft and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Softbank</a>, has made a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/kahoot-drops-50m-on-drops-to-add-language-learning-to-its-gamified-education-stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisitions to expand</a>. Clever is the biggest of these to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintech startup <a href="http://paystack.com/">Paystack</a> has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quiet since it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was bought by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintech giant Stripe last October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal, worth more than $200 million, caused shockwaves to the African tech ecosystem and offered some form of validation to work done by founders, startups and investors alike</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the payments company, which powers businesses with its payment API and is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> present in Nigeria and Ghana, is announcing its official launch in South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018 when we reported Paystack&#8217;s $8 million Series A (which Stripe also led), it was powering 15% of all online payments in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company had more than 10,000 businesses on its platform and expansion to other African countries was one way it planned to use the money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ghana was its next stop.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since expanding to Ghana, Paystack has grown and claims to power 50% of all online payments in Nigeria with around 60,000 customers, including small businesses, larger corporates, fintechs, educational institutions and online betting companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its customers include MTN, SPAR and UPS, and they use the company&#8217;s software to collect payments globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The South African launch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was preceded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a six-month pilot, which means the project kickstarted a month after Stripe acquired it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe is gearing toward a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hotly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anticipated IPO and has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before acquiring Paystack, the company added 17 countries to its platform in 18 months, but none from Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack was its meal ticket to the African online commerce market, and CEO Patrick Collison didn&#8217;t mince words when talking about the acquisition in October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is an enormous opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In absolute numbers, Africa may be smaller right now than other regions, but online commerce will grow about 30% every year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And even with wider global declines, online shoppers are growing twice as fast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe thinks on a longer time horizon than others because we are an infrastructure company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are thinking of what the world will look like in 2040-2050,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Stripe said the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">$600 million it raised in Series H</a> this March would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for European expansion, its foray deeper into Africa has kicked off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Paystack claims to have had a clear expansion roadmap prior to the acquisition, its relationship with Stripe is accelerating the realization of that pan-African expansion goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Africa accounts for three of the 42 countries where Stripe currently has customers today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;South Africa is one of the continent&#8217;s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commerce across Africa,&#8221; said Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade of the expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale and connects them to global markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-month pilot saw Paystack work with different businesses and grow a local team to handle on-the-ground operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlike Nigeria and Ghana, where Paystack has managed to be a top player, what are the company&#8217;s prospects in the South African market where it will face stiff competition from the likes of Yoco and DPO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity for innovation in the South African payment space is far from saturated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, for instance, digital payments make up less than half of all transactions in the country,&#8221; Abdulrahman Jogbojogbo, product marketer at Paystack said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So, the presence of competition is not only welcome; it&#8217;s encouraged. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more innovative plays there are, the faster it&#8217;ll be to realize our goal of having an integrated African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khadijah Abu, head of product expansion, added that &#8220;for many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people compare Paystack to Africa&#8217;s newest fintech unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Flutterwave</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded a year apart, both companies help businesses accept payments from thousands of businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the latter raised its recent juggernaut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">$170 million round</a>, it claimed to have 290,000 businesses on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave has been high-flying </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its pan-African expansion (it has a presence in 20 African countries), Paystack has adopted a rather scrupulous approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said the reason behind this lies with the peculiarities each African country presents and because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each country has different regulations, launching at scale takes time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal isn&#8217;t to have a presence in lots of countries, with little regard for service quality. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we deliver a stellar end-to-end payment experience in the countries we operate in,&#8221; Jogbojogbo continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And this takes some time, careful planning and lots of behind-the-scenes, foundational work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being backed by Stripe and armed with millions of dollars, Paystack might need to switch things up eventually. Even as it operates independently, its pan-African vision is equally important to Stripe, and speed will be crucial, even the five-year-old company acknowledges this and said, &#8220;its pace of expansion will quicken as it expands into more African countries.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, we’ve seen the rise of ‘Zoom investing’ &#8211; where VCs literally use remote video conference tools like Zoom and Google Meet to take pitches from entrepreneurs. Now a new European Seed fund plans to leverage that emerging behavior and bake it into their model.</p>
<p>Mattias Ljungman, the former co-founder of Atomico formed Moonfire when he left in December 2019, but few details were revealed about his new operation. Today Moonfire reveals it will be a $60 million seed-stage  &#8220;data-driven” VC that will also leverage the new advantages of remote working which entrepreneurs themselves have had to adapt to.</p>
<p>Admittedly Ljungman didn’t have much choice. Starting in January 2020, he ended up having to found, raise and close the fund, as well as invest, almost all remotely. But, he says, that means it will continue to take advantage of this &#8216;new normal&#8217;. “We are doing zoom investing. It’s the death of geography, and people are now pretty comfortable with that way of living,” he told me, literally via Zoom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moonfire’s first fund has been raised from LPs spanning the usual swathe of institutional investors, entrepreneurs, and VCs. Cendana, the US-based seed fund investment firm, is the anchor investor. It is joined by Utah School &amp; Institutional Trust Funds Office (SITFO) and Reference Capital, among others. Moonfire says the fund was significantly oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Moonfire will focus on a very broad range of areas which will include Health &amp; Wellbeing, Work &amp; Knowledge, Gaming, Community &amp; Leisure and Capital &amp; Finance. Its most recent investments across Europe include Humaans, Electric Noir Studios, Skunkworks, Pento, Awell Health, Mindstone, Business Score, Homerun, HiPeople, LoveShark, WillaPay, Oliva, Equify, and more.</p>
<p>Ljungman &#8216;knows his onions,&#8217; as the phrase goes. As a co-founder of Atomico he spent 20 years investing tech startups-turned-unicorns including Klarna, Supercell, Viagogo and Climate Corp.</p>
<p>Mike Arpaia and Candice Lo. Arpaia will partner the firm with Ljungman. Former computer scientist Arpaia joins Moonfire with experience from Etsy, Facebook, Kolide, and Workday. Lo has been an entrepreneur but is an operator turned investor with experience at Uber in Europe and China, as well as an early-stage investor with the UK&#8217;s Blossom Capital.</p>
<p>Ljungman says data will form the cornerstone of the fund. He said: “Venture will always be a relationship business, but it should be powered by data, software, and machine learning to hone and optimize everything we do from discovery, screening, and evaluation to delivering better insights for our founders. We are able to enhance traditional thesis-driven investing and make decision-making quicker and more effective.”</p>
<p>Of course, just about every VC these days says it uses data to invest &#8211; Inreach Ventures in London, for instance, is just one of many that makes a great play of this idea.</p>
<p>Over a video call, Ljungman countered: “You&#8217;re looking at utilizing software, automation, and machine learning. If you look at any industry that is what happened &#8211; software is eating it up. It touches every component of your process from discovering companies to managing them, evaluating them, helping them with support. So we still have our thesis-driven approach, but  what we&#8217;re doing is pairing it with software, like a bionic suit, so this is how to augment what we do and do it bigger and better.”</p>
<p>He added: “The European ecosystem is a lot bigger today, so relying on gut instinct, relationships, networking is not going to be efficient. Utilizing software is going to be critical for us. We have 1.4 million people already in our database. These entrepreneurs usually have a really nice history. The average entrepreneur is a lot older than it used to be, as well. If we&#8217;re looking at thousands of companies per year, there are real network effects. The more you build out your data the more you build out your portfolio, the more you make more investments, the better you are at helping and supporting your portfolio companies because you&#8217;ve institutionalized that knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham Pingree, Partner at Cendana Capital, said in a statement: “We’ve been watching the European start-up ecosystem mature and grow in the past year and we’re excited to have the opportunity to partner with the team at Moonfire as they look to expand their portfolio. Moonfire, like Cendana, is passionate about supporting founders at the earliest stages of their journey and they have the skills and expertise needed to nurture a new generation of founders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NFTs were arguably already taking off when Beeple sold his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">NFT artwork for $69m</a>. But another crypto project attracted attention when it bought an original Banksy artwork for $95,000.</p>
<p>The group literally burnt the artwork and sold its NFT on the OpenSea platform for $400,000. Although the stunt was covered by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/banksy-nft-injective-destroy-art-digital-token/">CBS News</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56335948">BBC News</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/09/nfts-flying-cats-burning-banksy-digital-art-crypto-art-bitcoin-rocketing">The Guardian</a>, and others, it did actually make a significant point.</p>
<p>By removing the physical piece, the group &#8211; calling itself “Burnt Banksy” &#8211; proved that the value of the piece wasn’t affected by being destroyed, given that the NFT went up so much in value.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that project is turning that stunt into an actual blockchain platform for art auctions.</p>
<p><a href="https://burnt.finance/">Burnt Finance</a> says it has raised $3 Million for a decentralized auction protocol built on the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The project is being incubated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/injective-protocol-raises-10m-from-pantera-capital-mark-cuban-for-its-defi-robinhood/">Injective Protocol</a> (which recently raised $10 from investors and Mark Cuban, as well as Multicoin, DeFiance, Alameda, Mechanism, Vessel Capital, Hashkey, Spartan, Do Kwon (CEO of Terra), Sandeep (COO of Polygon), and others.</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s worth mentioning all this is that in trying to auction the painting, the Burnt Banksy  group stumbled on an increasing problem in the world of NFTs: the rising congestion on the Ethereum network is leading to larger and larger gas fees. This is making both the creation and bidding on NFTs increasingly expensive, just from a baseline.</p>
<p>As a result, team decided to build the Burnt Finance NFT auction platform away from Etherum and hit upon the Solana blockchain, which has comparatively good speed, performance, and lower transaction costs. It will use &#8216;Solana Wormhole’ which connects ETH and ERC20 tokens to SPL Tokens.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Burnt Finance, &#8216;Burnt Banksy’ told me: &#8220;Most auctions are Ethereum based, and currently the Ethereum gas fees are extremely high. It can cost you up to $70 to make an artwork, which doesn’t work if you&#8217;re selling an NFT for $50. We chose Solana mainly because of the ecosystem. It&#8217;s fast-growing, in addition to the technical aspect of it.”</p>
<p>There’s another reason why we may see other Crypto projects move away from Ethereum as ETH rises in price and as gas fees increase: the potential for bad faith actors in NFT auctions.</p>
<p>If a bad actor tries to leverage the congestion on Ethereum and manipulate the transaction fee, they might sway the results of an auction. This would be quite something, if the auction was for, say, $69 million…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, has raised $110 million to help fund its expansion in Europe and into the United States.</p>
<p>The Series B round, which far exceeds its previous raises of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/einride-raises-10-million-to-fast-track-its-autonomous-electric-cargo-pods/">$10 million</a> in 2020 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-eyes-u-s-market-with-25-million-in-new-funding/">$25 million</a> in 2019, included new investors Temasek, Soros Fund Management LLC, Northzone and Maersk Growth. The company said Thursday that existing investors EQT Ventures, Plum Alley, Norrsken VC, Ericsson and NordicNinja VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.einride.tech/">Einride</a> has raised a total of $150 million to date. The company didn&#8217;t share its post-money valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, founded in 2016 by Robert Falck, Linnéa Kornehed, and Filip Lilja, has two kinds of vehicles: connected, electric heavy trucks driven by humans and its driverless Pods.</p>
<p>The electric trucks do much the freight-shuttling work today for customers like Swedish food producer Oatly, Coca-Cola, Lidl and Electrolux. The company&#8217;s pitch is that its electric trucks reduce emissions for its customers by 94% compared to driving with diesel. Einride has also developed a digital platform for carriers that handles planning, scheduling and routing as well as invoices and billing.</p>

<p>The company is perhaps best known for its Einride Pod — once called the T-Pod —  a self-driving truck that doesn&#8217;t have a cab and can be controlled remotely. The first-generation vehicle has been tested on public roads in Sweden and even carried freight in a pilot program for Oatly. In October, the <a href="https://www.einride.tech/press/einride-launches-next-generation-pod-makes-autonomous-electric-transport">unveiled a line of next-generation</a> pod freight-carrying vehicles that depending on its level of autonomy will begin shipping to customers as early as this year.</p>
<p>Einride will be using this significant injection of capital to fulfill current customer contracts, double its 100-person workforce by the end of the year  and expand in Europe and into the United States, according to CEO Robert Falck.</p>
<p>Einride will have operations up and running in the U.S. before the end of the year and are looking to set up a headquarters in Austin, Texas, and additional offices in New York and Silicon Valley, Falck said in an email. Global agreements are in place with brands such as Oatly, which includes U.S. operations, with more to be announced soon, he added.</p>

<p>As Einride continues to scale its human-powered electric trucking operation, it is also working on the long-term goal of rolling out commercial driverless Pods. Einride has said its new Pods will be available with differing levels of autonomy and functionality based on its internal Autonomous Electric Transport (AET) classification system, which ranges from levels 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Its AET 1 Pod is for closed facilities with predetermined routes that are best suited for fully-autonomous operation. The constraints expand from there with Pods at AET 2 designed for closed facility operation with an added capability to traverse public roads over short distances between destinations. Einride has said that these first two level of Pods will begin shipping to customers starting in 2021.</p>
<p>Level 3 allows for operation on backroads and less busy main roads between facilities, at a maximum operating speed of 28 mph. At Level 4, under Einride&#8217;s system, the Pod will operate autonomously on freeways and other major roads at up to 52 mph. Einride has said that Levels 3 and 4 will ship to customers in 2022 and 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While incumbent insurance providers continue to get disrupted by startups like Lemonade, Alan, Clearcover, Pie and many others applying tech to rethink how to build a business around helping people and companies mitigate against risks with some financial security, one issue that has not disappeared is fraud. Today, a startup out of France is announcing some funding for AI technology that it has built for all insurance providers, old and new, to help them detect and prevent it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shift-technology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shift Technology</a>, which provides a set of AI-based SaaS tools to insurance companies to scan and automatically flag fraud scenarios across a range of use cases &#8212; they include claims fraud, claims automation, underwriting, subrogation detection and financial crime detection &#8212; has raised $220 million, money that it will be using both to expand in the property and casualty insurance market, the area where it is already strong, as well as to expand into health, and to double down on growing its business in the U.S. It also provides fraud detection for the travel insurance sector.</p>
<p>This Series D is being led Advent International, via Advent Tech, with participation from Avenir and others. Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Iris Capital &#8212; who were all part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/shift-technology-raises-60-million-to-detect-insurance-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shift&#8217;s Series C led by Bessemer in 2019</a> &#8212; also participated. With this round, Paris and Boston-based Shift Technology has now raised some $320 million and has confirmed that it is now valued at over $1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company currently has around 100 customers across 25 different countries &#8212; with the list including Generali France and Mitsui Sumitomo, to give you an idea of where it&#8217;s pitching its business &#8212; and says that it has already analyzed nearly two billion claims, data that&#8217;s feeding its machine learning algorithms to improve how they work.</p>
<p>The challenge (or I suppose, opportunity) that Shift is tackling, however, is much bigger. The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a non-profit in the U.S., estimates that at <a href="https://insurancefraud.org/fraud-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">least $80 billion of fraudulent claims</a> are made annually in the U.S. alone, but the figure is likely significantly higher. One problem has, ironically, been the move to more virtualized processes, which open the door to malicious actors exploiting loopholes in claims filing and fudging information. Another is the fact that insurance has grown as a market, but so too has the amount of people who are in financial straights, leading to more desperate and illegal acts to gain an edge.</p>
<p>Shift is also not alone in tackling this issue: the market for insurance fraud detection technology globally was estimated to be worth $2.5 billion in 2019 and projected to be worth <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/22/1973834/0/en/The-global-insurance-fraud-detection-market-size-is-expected-to-grow-from-USD-2-5-billion-in-2019-to-USD-7-9-billion-by-2024-at-a-compound-annual-growth-rate-CAGR-of-25-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much as $8 billion by 2024</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to others in claims management tech such as Brightcore and Guidewire, many of the wave of insuretech startups are building in their own in-house AI-based fraud protection, and it&#8217;s very likely that we&#8217;ll see a rise of other fraud protection services, built out of adjacent areas like fintech to guard against financial crime, making their way to insurance. As many a fintech entrepreneur has said to me in the past, the mechanics of how the two verticals work and the compliance issues both face are very closely aligned.</p>
<p>“The entire Shift team has worked tirelessly to build this company and provide insurers with the technology solutions they need to empower employees to best be there for their policyholders. We are thrilled to partner with Advent International, given their considerable sector expertise and global reach and are taking another giant step forward with this latest investment,” stated Jeremy Jawish, CEO and co-founder, Shift Technology, in a statement. “We have only just scratched the surface of what is possible when AI-based decision automation and optimization is applied to the critical processes that drive the insurance policy lifecycle.”</p>
<p>For its backers, one key point with Shift is that it&#8217;s helping older providers bring on more tools and services that can help them improve their margins as well as better compete against the technology built by newer players.</p>
<p>“Since its founding in 2014, Shift has made a name for itself in the complex world of insurance,” said Thomas Weisman, an Advent director, in a statement. “Shift’s advanced suite of SaaS products is helping insurers to reshape manual and often time-consuming claims processes in a safer and more automated way. We are proud to be part of this exciting company’s next wave of growth.”</p>
