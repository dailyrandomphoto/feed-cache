										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm, India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, confirmed to its shareholders and employees on Monday that it plans to file for an IPO.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders and employees, Paytm said that it plans to raise money by issuing fresh equity in the IPO, and also sell existing shareholders&#8217; shares at the event. The startup has offered its employees the option to sell their stakes in the firm.</p>
<p>This is the first time the Noida-headquartered firm has commented on its plans about the IPO. The startup said in the letter that it has received an in-principle approval from the board of directors to pursue the public market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba and SoftBank, hasn&#8217;t shared when it plans to file for the IPO, but has sought shareholders&#8217; response to their intention to sell stakes by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Paytm plans to raise about $3 billion and is targeting a valuation of up to $30 billion in the IPO. Paytm declined to comment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162139" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162139" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162139 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg 1654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=300,104 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=768,266 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=680,235 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=1536,531 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-ipo.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162139" class="wp-caption-text">Paytm&#8217;s letter &#8212; obtained by TechCrunch &#8212; to shareholders on Monday.</p></div></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Paytm has planned to explore the public route. Exactly 10 years ago, long before Paytm established itself as the largest mobile wallet firm and expanded to several financial and commerce services, the startup had filed with the regulator with intentions to become public. The startup at the time cancelled the IPO plan and instead raised money from VCs to explore new avenues for growth.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[You have questions. I have questions. We'll get to some answers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to the week, and welcome back to The Exchange. Robinhood has yet to file its IPO, so we&#8217;re looking at other companies in the meantime. Today it&#8217;s Babylon Health, a British healthtech company that is <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/press/babylon-announces-plans-to-become-a-public-company-via-4.2-billion-merger-with-alkuri-global-acquisition-corp">pursuing a U.S. listing</a> via a blank-check company, or SPAC.</p>
<p>You have questions. I have questions. We&#8217;ll get to some answers.</p>
<p>But before we do, we wanted to note that Anna and I are looking into the AI startup market tomorrow morning. If you are a VC with notes regarding the current pace of investment into the sector or thoughts on where customer traction is highest, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">let us know</a>. If you are a founder building an AI-powered startup, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">we&#8217;d also like to hear from you</a> about what you are seeing. Use the subject line &#8220;AI startups,&#8221; please.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get into Babylon Health. We&#8217;ll kick off with a short riff on its fundraising history, talk about its product, and then dive into its numbers and, bracing ourselves for impact, its projections.</p>
<p>The larger context this morning is that we&#8217;re doing legwork ahead of what could be a super active Q3 2021 IPO cycle. Kanzhun, a Chinese company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001842827/000119312521183071/d151203df1a.htm">has also filed for a U.S. listing</a>. Toss in Robinhood whenever it gets off its duff and gives us its own filing, and we&#8217;re being promised a good time.</p>
<h2>Babylon Health</h2>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/babylon-health/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, Babylon has raised north of $600 million as a private company. Its funding, however, has not come from sources that we tend to discuss here at TechCrunch. Instead, the company raised some money from more traditional investors like Hoxton Ventures and Kinnevik, but the bulk of its capital was raised from the Saudi Arabian &#8220;Public Investment Fund,&#8221; or PIF. The PIF led a $550 million round into the British healthtech company back in August 2019.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> has the round cut into two parts, the larger, first portion of which valued the company at $1.9 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>That figure brings us to the SPAC deal that Babylon is now pursuing. The company&#8217;s new equity value after its SPAC deal will land around $4.2 billion, with Babylon sitting on around $540 million in cash after the deal is completed. The company will sport a lower, $3.6 billion enterprise valuation after its merger with SPAC Alkuri.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Four women from engineering backgrounds described daily challenges and their strong determination to be the best engineers they can be -- without all the obstruction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Women engineers often face workplace and career challenges that their male colleagues don&#8217;t because they remain a minority in the profession: Depending on how you count, women make up just 13% to 25% of engineering jobs. That inequity leads to a power imbalance, which can lead to toxic working environments.</p>
<p>One of the more infamous and egregious examples is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/former-uber-engineer-says-company-ignored-repeated-reports-of-harassment/">Susan Fowler&#8217;s experience at Uber</a>. In <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">a blog post in February 2017</a>, she described her boss coming on to her in a company chat channel on her first day on the job. She later wrote <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/585732/whistleblower-by-susan-fowler/">a book, &#8220;Whistleblower,&#8221;</a> that described her time at the company in detail.</p>
<p>Fowler&#8217;s ordeal cast a spotlight on the harassment women engineers have to deal with in the workplace. In a profession that tends to be male-dominated, behavior ranges from blatant examples, like what happened to Fowler, to ongoing daily microaggressions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Four female engineers spoke with me about their challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tammy Butow, principal software reliability engineer (SRE) at Gremlin</li>
<li>Rona Chong, software engineer at Grove Collaborative</li>
<li>Ana Medina, senior chaos engineer at Gremlin</li>
<li>Yury Roa, SRE technical program manager at ADL Digital Labs in Bogota, Colombia</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Fowler was also an SRE who worked on the same team as Medina (who was later part of a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-agrees-to-pay-10-million-to-settle-discrimination-suit/">$10 million discrimination lawsuit</a> against Uber). It shows just how small of a world we are talking about. While not everyone faced that level of harassment, they each described daily challenges, some of which wore them down. But they also showed a strong determination to overcome whatever obstacles came their way.</p>
<h2>Feeling isolated</h2>
<p>One of the primary issues these women faced throughout their careers is a feeling of isolation due to their underrepresentation. They say that can sometimes lead to self-doubt and an inkling that you don&#8217;t belong that can be difficult to overcome. Medina says that there have been times when, intentionally or not, male engineers made her feel unwelcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;One part that was really hard for me was those microaggressions on a daily basis, and that affects your work ethic, wanting to show up, wanting to try your best. And not only does that damage your own self-esteem, but your esteem [in terms of] growing as an engineer,&#8221; Medina explained.</p>
<p>Roa says that isolation can lead to impostor syndrome. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to have more women in these roles: to serve as mentors, role models and peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One barrier for us related to being the only woman in the room is that [it can lead to] impostor syndrome because it is common when you are the only woman or one of few, it can be really challenging for us. So we need to gain confidence, and in these cases, it is very important to have role models and leadership that includes women,&#8221; Roa said.</p>
<p>Chong agrees it is essential to know that others have been in the same position &#8212; and found a way through.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former Uber engineer says company ignored repeated reports of sexual harassment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/former-uber-engineer-says-company-ignored-repeated-reports-of-harassment/embed/#?secret=G9jWnhYjY8" data-secret="G9jWnhYjY8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The fact that people talk authentically about their own jobs and challenges and how they&#8217;ve overcome that, that&#8217;s been really helpful for me to continue seeing myself in the tech industry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There have been points where I&#8217;ve questioned whether I should Ieave, but then having that support around you to have people to talk to you personally and see as examples, I think it has really helped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Butow described being interviewed for an article early in her career after she won an award for a mobile application she wrote.  When the article was published, she was aghast to discover it had been headlined, &#8220;Not just another pretty face…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like, that&#8217;s the title?! I was so excited to share the article with my mom, and then I wasn&#8217;t. I spent so much time writing the code and obviously my face had nothing to do with it. &#8230; So there&#8217;s just little things like that where people call it a paper cut or something like that, but it&#8217;s just lots of little microaggressions.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Pushing through</h2>
<p>In spite of all that, a common thread among these women was a strong desire to show that they have the technical skill to get past these moments of doubt to thrive in their professions.</p>
<p>Butow said she has been battling these kinds of misperceptions since she was a teenager but never let it stop her. &#8220;I just tried to not let it bother me, but mostly because I also have a background in skateboarding. It&#8217;s the same thing, right? You go to a skate park and people would say, &#8216;Oh, can you even do a trick?&#8217; and I was like, &#8216;Watch me.&#8217; You know, I [would] just do it. &#8230; So a lot of that happens in lots of different types of places in the world and you just have to, I don&#8217;t know, I just always push through, like I&#8217;m just going to do it anyway.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DrVRhbZAXI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/theres-a-better-way-to-build-your-startup/">There&#8217;s a better way to build your startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There&#8217;s a better way to build your startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/25/theres-a-better-way-to-build-your-startup/embed/#?secret=DrVRhbZAXI" data-secret="DrVRhbZAXI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chong says she doesn&#8217;t give in to discouraging feelings, adding that having other women to talk to helped push her through those times.</p>
<p>&#8220;As much as I like to persevere and I don&#8217;t like giving up, actually there have been points where I considered quitting, but having visibility into other people&#8217;s experiences, knowing that you&#8217;re not the only one who&#8217;s experienced that, and seeing that they&#8217;ve found better environments for themselves and that they eventually worked through it, and having those people tell you that they believe in you, that probably stopped me from leaving when I [might] have otherwise,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Women helping women</h2>
<p>Chong&#8217;s experience is not unique, but the more diverse your teams are, the more people who come from underrepresented groups can support one another. Butow recruited her at one point, and she says that was a huge moment for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there is a network effect where we know other women and we try to bring them in and we expand on that. So we can kind of create the change or we feel the change we want to see, and we get to make our situation more comfortable,&#8221; Chong said.</p>
<p>Medina says that she is motivated to help bring Latinx and Black people into tech, with a focus on attracting girls and young women. She has worked with a group called <a href="https://technolochicas.org/">Technolachicas</a>, which produced a series of commercials with the <a href="https://televisafoundation.org">Televisa Foundation</a>. They filmed six videos, three in English and three in Spanish, with the goal of showing young girls how to pursue a STEM career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each commercial talks about how we got our career started with an audience persona of a girl younger than 18, an adult influencer and a parent &#8212; people that are really crucial to the development of anyone under 18,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How is it that these people can actually empower someone to look at STEM and to pursue a career in STEM?&#8221;</p>
<p>Butow says it&#8217;s about lifting people up. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is sharing our story and hoping to inspire other women. It&#8217;s super important to have those role models. There&#8217;s a lot of research that shows that that&#8217;s actually the most important thing is just visibility of role models that you can relate to,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal? Having enough support in the workplace that they&#8217;re able to concentrate on being the best engineers they can be &#8212; without all of the obstruction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has long positioned itself a source for inspiration that could ultimately lead to online purchases. And over the years, it has worked on features to better connect consumers with the products and services they want to buy, like shoppable pins, visual search, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">AR try-on</a>, product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">recommendations</a> and more. Today, the company is rolling out another feature aimed at turning users&#8217; saved Pins into purchases: a shopping list.</p>
<p>The new Pinterest Shopping list feature saves all your Product Pins in one place, so when you&#8217;re ready to purchase you won&#8217;t have to hunt around through your saved Pins and Boards to find the products you had been considering. Here, you&#8217;ll find the information you need, including an item&#8217;s price, reviews and shipping info in an even grid so you can compare products and make decisions.</p>
<p>The feature, however, isn&#8217;t just an organizational tool &#8212; Pinterest says it also will send out notifications if the items you&#8217;ve saved have dropped in price &#8212; which could encourage users to make the purchase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Shopping List is available on your Profile page above your other boards, and will include the shoppable items you&#8217;ve saved as well as items you&#8217;ve recently viewed. When you&#8217;re ready to buy, you can click on the pin to visit the retailer&#8217;s website to complete the transaction &#8212; giving Pinterest the credit for the referral, of course.</p>
<p>The feature will launch first in the U.S. and U.K., and will later roll out to Australia, Canada, France and Germany later in the year, Pinterest says.</p>

<p>Alongside the Shopping List, Pinterest today is also expanding merchant tools with the debut of its Verified Merchant Program in the U.K., Australia, Canada, France and Germany, plus a merchant storefront on profile feature, and new product tagging in Australia, Canada, France and Germany.<a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/verified-merchant-program"> Launched last year,</a> the Verified Merchant Program offers retailers a way to sign up for a manual review to determine if they meet Pinterest&#8217;s qualifications for high-quality customer service experiences. If so, they receive a blue checkmark on their profile as a signal to consumers that they&#8217;re a trustworthy retailer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162057" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162057" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2162057" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Shopping-List-US-GIF.gif?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162057" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, the company is today launching a special two-week long Shopping Spotlight called &#8220;The Goods by Pinterest,&#8221; which offers users access to limited-edition items sold by DTC brands including Brooklinen, Outdoor Voices, Clare Paint, Olive &amp; June, and Maude. And it&#8217;s running a &#8220;Shop the mood&#8221; campaign offering curated trends from its annual report, &#8220;Pinterest Predicts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Pinterest notes its users, on average, outspend non-users by 2x every month and have a 85% larger basket size, the way people want to shop online is rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Historically an image-centric idea board of sorts, Pinterest may be left behind as more consumers &#8212; and particularly younger shoppers &#8212; begin to more heavily rely on shopping via video (both recorded and live), including through influencer-driven content across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Pinterest has only more recently expanded into this area, with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">video-first &#8220;Idea Pins&#8221; last month</a> aimed at creators, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">a test of livestreamed creator events</a> around the same time.</p>
<p>The new launches follow a Pinterest earnings beat in April on both EPS and revenue (11 cents versus 7 cents expected, and $485 million versus $474 million expected), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/pinterest-pins-earnings-q1-2021.html">but slowing user growth</a>. The company reported 478 million monthly active users versus the 480.5 million expected, causing the stock to drop 10% after the report came out. The company blamed the decline in user growth and user engagement on the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, as consumers began to spend less time online.</p>
<p>With the new additions, Pinterest wants to better ensure those users who are on its site are not just idly browsing, but actually checking out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s broadcast regulator, the National Broadcasting Commission, has ordered all broadcasting stations in the country to suspend their use of Twitter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was issued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday morning, and the broadcasting stations include TV and radio platforms in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in,&#8221; an excerpt of the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is coming days after the country suspended Twitter operations when the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial tweet made by President Muhammadu Buhari wherein he threatened to punish secessionists in the southeastern part of the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">cited</a> the micro-blogging platform&#8217;s alleged ploy to &#8220;undermine its corporate existence&#8221; as one reason for the indefinite suspension</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wbxEQ33pfz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/embed/#?secret=wbxEQ33pfz" data-secret="wbxEQ33pfz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside this directive was an order to the NBC to “immediately </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that is still a work in progress, Nigerians haven&#8217;t been able to use Twitter since the early hours of Saturday as telecom operators in the country restricted access to the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, most people have employed VPNs and other alternative platforms to bypass the domain restrictions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, following Nigerians&#8217; disregard of the government&#8217;s order, the country&#8217;s attorney general and minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, via his spokesperson, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html">issued a troubling directive</a> over the weekend</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Malami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to swing into action and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria,&#8221; the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No public arrests have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so far. And although it isn&#8217;t entirely known how the attorney general and his cohorts will carry out that directive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are fears that the government will employ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">illegal means to perform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there has been widespread criticism of the Twitter ban, both in the country and abroad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement with the EU, the U.S., Canada and the U.K. expressed disappointment in the ban. They called out the Buhari-led administration for censorship and human right violation and requested that the Nigerian government reconsider its stance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, it appeared as though the government would budge. The president, via his spokesperson, declared that the state-wide ban on Twitter was only a temporary measure to curb misinformation and fake news</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real-world violent consequences,” the government said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allowed &#8220;the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages that could tear some countries apart&#8221;, the spokesperson added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with today&#8217;s directive, the government might be speaking out of both sides of its mouth. The statement released referenced section 5.6.3 of the NBC Act to the role it believes Twitter plays in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadcasting code &#8220;requires broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a user-generated content (UGC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulator didn&#8217;t forget to leave a subtle warning, stating that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in the country to continue patronising Twitter as a source of information, &#8220;therefore strict compliance is enjoined.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s WWDC week, so expect a deluge of Apple news to overtake your Twitter feed here and there over the next few days. But there&#8217;s a lot more going on, so let&#8217;s dig in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weekend:</strong> A supercharged, <em>supercharged</em> Model S Tesla car is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/06/elon-musk-officially-hits-the-brakes-on-tesla-model-s-plaid/">not coming out</a>. Instead, a merely supercharged version will come out. It&#8217;s still stupid fast and expensive. And <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/nigerian-twitter-ban-how-government-restriction-affects-people">Nigeria&#8217;s war with Twitter continued</a>, with new efforts from the African nation to limit access to the social media service within its borders.</li>
<li><strong>This Morning:</strong> Flipkart is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/walmarts-flipkart-talks-raise-3-bln-softbank-others-bloomberg-news-2021-06-07/">raising $3 billion at a roughly $40 billion valuation</a>. The deal underscores not just how big the Indian tech scene is, but also how much investor interest there is in e-commerce bets more generally. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">Jeff Bezos is going to space</a>. Soon!</li>

The Canadian startup is now worth far more than $1 billion. And Chinese company Kanzhun is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001842827/000119312521169431/d151203df1.htm">going public in the United States</a>, which raised an eyebrow here amongst the Equity Morning Crew.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Take The Damn Equity Survey</a>:</strong> Take it! All the cools kids are taking it!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The medical industry is sitting on a huge trove of data, but in many cases it can be a challenge to realize the value of it because that data is unstructured and in disparate places.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.mendel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mendel</a>, which has built an AI platform both to ingest and bring order to that body of information, is announcing $18 million in funding to continue its growth and to build out what it describes as a &#8220;clinical data marketplace&#8221; for people not just to organize, but also to share and exchange that data for research purposes. It&#8217;s also going to be using the funding to hire more talent &#8212; technical and support &#8212; for its two offices, in San Jose, California and Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The Series A round is being led by DCM, with OliveTree and MTVLP, and previous backers Launch Capital, SOSV, Bootstrap Labs and chairman of UCSF Health Hub Mark Goldstein also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of what Mendel says is a surge of interest among research and pharmaceutical companies in sourcing better data to gain a better understanding of longer-term patient care and progress, in particular across wider groups of users, not just at a time when it has been more challenging to observe people and run trials, but in light of the understanding that using AI to leverage much bigger data sets can produce better insights.</p>
<p>This can be important, for example, in proactively identifying symptoms of particular ailments or the pathology of a disease, but also recurring and more typical responses to specific treatment courses.</p>
<p>We previously wrote about Mendel back in 2017 when the company had received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/01/mendel-ai-nabs-2-million-to-match-cancer-patients-with-the-latest-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $2 million</a> to better match cancer patients with the various clinical trials that are regularly being run: the idea was that certain trials address specific types of cancers and types of patients, and those who are willing to try newer approaches will be better or worse suited to each of these.</p>
<p>It turned out, however, that Mendel discovered a problem in the data that it would have needed to enable its matching algorithms to work, said Dr. Karim Galil, Mendel&#8217;s CEO and founder.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;As we were trying to build the trial business, we discovered a more basic problem that hadn’t been solved,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;It was the reading and understanding medical records of a patient. If you can’t do that you can’t do trial matching.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So the startup decided to become an R&amp;D shop for at least three years to solve that problem before doing anything with trials, he continued.</p>
<p>Although there are today many AI companies that are parsing unstructured information in order to extract better insights, Mendel is what you might think of as part of the guard of tech companies that are building out specific AI knowledge bases for distinct verticals or areas of expertise. (Another example from another vertical is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/eigen-nabs-37m-to-help-banks-and-others-parse-huge-documents-using-natural-language-and-small-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eigen, working in the legal and finance industries</a>, while Google&#8217;s DeepMind is another major AI player looking at ways of better harnessing data in the sphere of medicine.)</p>
<p>The issue of &#8220;reading&#8221; natural language is more nuanced than you might think in the world of medicine. Galil compared it to the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave you&#8221; in English, which could just as easily mean someone is departing, say, a room, as someone is walking out of a relationship. The &#8220;true&#8221; answer &#8212; and as we humans know even truth can be elusive &#8212; can only start to be found in the context.</p>
<p>The same goes for doctors and their observation notes, Galil said. &#8220;There is a lot hidden between the lines, and problems can be specific to a person,&#8221; or to a situation.</p>
<p>That has proven to be a lucrative area to tackle.</p>
<p>Mendel uses a mix of computer vision and natural language processing built by teams with extensive experience in both clinical environments and in building AI algorithms and currently provides tools to automate clinical data abstraction, OCR, special tools to redact and remove personal identifiable information automatically to share records, search engines to search clinical data and &#8212; yes &#8212; an engine to enable better matching of people to clinical trials. Customers include pharmaceutical and life science companies, real-world data and real-world evidence (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/real-world-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RWD and RWE</a>) providers and research groups.</p>

<p>And to underscore just how much there is still left to do in the world of medicine, along with this funding round, Mendel is announcing a partnership with eFax, an online faxing solution used by a huge number of healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Faxing is totally antiquated in some parts of the world now &#8212; I&#8217;m not even sure that people the age of my children (tweens) even know what a &#8220;fax&#8221; is &#8212; but they remain one of the most-used ways to transfer documents and information between people in the worlds of healthcare and medicine, with 90% of the industry using them today. The partnership with Mendel will mean that those eFaxes will now be &#8220;read&#8221; and digitized and ingested into wider platforms to tap that data in a more useful way.</p>
<p class="p1">“There is huge potential for the global healthcare industry to leverage AI,” said Mendel board member and partner at DCM, Kyle Lui, in a statement. “Mendel has created a unique and seamless solution for healthcare organizations to automatically make sense of their clinical data using AI. We look forward to continuing to work with the team on this next stage of growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen-based generators are an environmentally friendly alternative to ones powered by diesel fuel. But many rely on solar, hydro or wind power, which aren’t available all the time. Brisbane-based <a href="https://www.endua.com/">Endua</a> is making hydrogen-based power generators more accessible by using electrolysis to create more hydrogen and storing it for long-term use. The startup’s technology was developed at CSIRO, Australian’s national science agency, and is being commercialized by Main Sequence, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">venture fund founded by CSIRO </a>and Ampol, one of the country’s largest fuel companies.</p>
<p>Main Sequence’s venture science model means that it first identifies a global challenge, then brings together the technology, team and investors to launch a startup that can address that problem. Through the program, Paul Sernia, the founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/ev-fast-charger-developer-tritium-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-at-1-2b-valuation/">electric vehicle charger maker Tritium</a>, was brought on to serve as Endua’s chief executive officer, working with Main Sequence partner Martin Duursma to commercialize the hydrogen-based power generation and storage technology developed at CSIRO. Ampol will serve as Endua’s industry partner.</p>
<p>Endua is backed by $5 million AUD (about $3.9 million USD) from Main Sequence, CSIRO and Ampol. The company plans to launch in Australia first before expanding into other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sernia told TechCrunch that Endua was created to “solve one of the biggest problems facing the transition to renewable energy — how to store renewable energy in large quantities, for long periods of time.”</p>
<p>Endua’s modular power banks can run up to 150 kilowatts per pack and be extended for different use cases, serving as an alternative to power generators that run on diesel fuel. Batteries serve as backup, but Endua’s goal is to deliver renewable energy that can be stored in large quantities, enabling off-grid infrastructure and communities to have self-sustaining power sources.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen electrolysis technology has been around for quite some time but it still has a long way to go to meet the expectations of commercial markets and be cost-effective when compared to existing energy sources,” Sernia said. “The technology we’ve developed with CSIRO enables us to make the cost more affordable compared to fossil fuel sources, more reliable and easily maintained in remote communities.”</p>

<p>The startup plans to focus on industrial clients before reaching smaller businesses and residences. “One of the biggest opportunities, that few have really tackled, is that of diesel generator users like regional communities, mines or remote infrastructure,” Sernia said. “In farming, Endua’s solution could be used to power equipment such as a bore or irrigation pumps.” The power banks can plug into existing renewable energy systems, including solar and wind, to make the switch economical for users, he added. Water is part of the electrolysis process, but only a small amount is needed.</p>
<p>“Batteries are a great way to deliver dispatchable power in small increments and are a complementary part of the overall transition plan, but we’re focusing on delivering renewable energy that can be stored in large quantities, for large periods of time, so communities and remote infrastructure can access reliable, renewable energy at any time of day,” Sernia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ampol is working with Endua as part of its <a href="https://www.ampol.com.au/about-ampol/sustainability/future-energy">Future Energy and Decarbonisation Strategy</a>. It will test and commercialize Endua’s tech to reach its 80,000 B2B customers, focusing first on the off-grid diesel generator market, which the company said generates 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Ampol managing director and CEO Matthew Halliday said, “We are excited to be involved with Endua, which is part of our commitment to extending our customer value proposition by finding and developing new energy solutions that will assist with their energy transition.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More signs of the global market righting the ship after a disastrous 2020. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-07-1q21-smartphone-market-share">New figures from Gartne</a><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-07-1q21-smartphone-market-share">r</a> point to 26% increase in global sales year over year for the first quarter of 2021. The overall increase is an impressive one, though it comes after a couple of years of market slow down, followed by a step drop amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Manufacturers got hit from all sides last year. 2020 kicked things off with a manufacturing slowdown, as China and greater Asia were the first to be impacted by the effects of Covid-19. In the following months, global demand slowed, as shutdowns were instated and job loss and economic issues massively hampered sales.</p>

<p>The new Gartner numbers maintain the same global top three manufacturers as this time last year. Samsung’s overall market share grew from 18.4- to 20.3%, courtesy of budget devices, returning to the number one spot.</p>
<p>Apple had managed to push its way to number one in Q4, on the strength of its belated 5G push. The company dropped down to number two for the first quarter – the same position it held this time last year. Overall, its market share is up around 2% y-o-y to 15.5, according to the figures. The top five are rounded out by three Chinese manufacturers &#8212; Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo – as Huawei’s struggles continue.</p>
<p>Thus far, global chip shortages appear to have had little impact on shipments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra, the space launch startup with plans to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">public via a SPAC merger</a>, will acquire electric propulsion maker Apollo Fusion, the company said Monday. Electric propulsion systems are effective at moving spacecraft from lower to higher orbits, even to the moon, Astra Chief Engineer Benjamin Lyon said in a blog post Monday, pointing to Astra&#8217;s plans beyond missions to Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Astra will buy Apollo for $30 million in stock and $20 million in cash, for a total purchase price of $50 million. There is also the potential for an additional earn-out of up to $95 million if Apollo hits certain performance benchmarks. PJT Partners is acting as financial advisor to Astra with regard to the transaction, the Alameda-based launch startup said Monday.</p>
<p>Astra CEO Chris Kemp has been forthright about his goal of making the company a vertically integrated launch and space services provider, and Apollo’s thruster technology is a major piece of that puzzle. Astra <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">successfully launched</a> its first test rocket from Kodiak, Alaska last December, but in public statements Kemp has indicated plans for monthly commercial launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apollo produces two EP thruster systems, the Apollo Constellation Engine (ACE) and the ACE Max. Both are compatible with krypton or xenon propellants. The company said it had been selected by York Space Systems as the propulsion system provider for a LEO satellite constellation program that will be launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The transaction between Astra and Apollo will close after Astra’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Holicity is completed later this year. Kemp <a href="https://twitter.com/Kemp/status/1401908302305320961">tweeted</a> on Monday that the company intends to start trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ASTR on July 1.</p>
<p><em>The story has been updated to include Chris Kemp&#8217;s tweet.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And we’re back. Well, not back-back. But we’re here in the San Jose McEnery Convention Center of the mind. The parking is awful and the hotels all got booked up five months ago, so we’re taking the CalTrain in from Redwood City (of the mind).</p>
<p>We’ve got a full house at this morning’s virtual kick off to Apple’s annual developer conference. And good thing, too. It’s shaping up to be a packed event. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">read more about that here</a>. You can also check out Apple’s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-live-stream-livestream-wwdc-event-keynote-2021-ios-ipados-15/">livestream here</a>. And, of course, we’ll be breaking out the biggest news into bite-sized chunks.</p>
<p>As always, the kickoff event is focused on Apple’s (numerous) operating systems: iOS/iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and, perhaps, a new homeOS. Often times that also comes with some new hardware. After all, you’ll need something to run those operating systems on.</p>
<p>Matthew will be leading the show, with help from various members of the TC team. Things kick off today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tata Digital, a subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, said on Monday it has signed a deal to invest up to $75 million in fitness startup CureFit. As part of the deal, CureFit co-founder and chief executive Mukesh Bansal will join Tata Digital as President and also continue in his role at the Bangalore-headquartered startup.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s investment is the salt-to-steel giant&#8217;s latest effort to expand its presence in the consumer tech space. Earlier this year, Tata Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tata-group-reaches-agreement-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bigbasket/">acquired majority stake in online grocery startup BigBasket</a>, and is reportedly in talks to acquire online pharmacy 1mg, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Prior to today&#8217;s announcement, CureFit had raised about $418 million and was last valued at $815 million, according to insight firm Tracxn. The two companies didn&#8217;t share how Tata&#8217;s investment valued CureFit, which is also sometimes stylized as Cure.fit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/indias-top-fitness-and-wellbeing-startup-cure-fit-expands-to-the-u-s/">expanded to the U.S. market last year</a>, had about 1.5 million monthly active users in India last month, down from about 4.5 million in April 2020, according to mobile insight firm App Annie &#8212; data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joining Tata Digital marks an exciting new step for me and my team and is a recognition of the value we have created with CureFit for fitness enthusiasts in India,&#8221; said Bansal, who sold his previous venture Myntra to Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being part of Tata Digital will enable us to nationally scale up our offerings for our customers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspeed</a> has picked up two more companies in what is shaping up to be an acquisition spree for the Canadian point-of-sale software provider. The company today <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightspeed-to-acquire-ecwid-and-nuorder-to-unify-commerce-ecosystem-and-ignite-business-creation-301306660.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would acquire e-commerce platform Ecwid for $500 million; and NuOrder, a B2B ordering platform servicing wholesales, brands and retailers, for $425 million.</p>
<p>Together, the two deals underscore the long-anticipated consolidation trend swirling around the fragmented e-commerce industry, at a time when digital transactions are playing an ever more critical role in the Covid-impacted global economy, and smaller players are looking for better ways to compete against behemoths like Amazon and Stripe with a mix of tools and services addressing the various needs of merchants, brands, suppliers and everything in between.</p>
<p>&#8220;By joining forces with Ecwid and NuOrder, Lightspeed becomes the common thread uniting merchants, suppliers and consumers, a transformation we believe will enable innovative retailers to adapt to the new world of commerce,&#8221; said Dax Dasilva, founder and CEO of Lightspeed, in a statement. &#8220;As economies reopen and business creation accelerates, we hope to embolden entrepreneurs with the tools they need to simplify their operations and scale their ambitions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lightspeed will pay $175 million in cash and $325 million in shares for Ecwid; and it will pay $212.5 million in cash and $212.5 million in shares for NuOrder, the company said. Both deals are expected to close at the end of September, pending regulatory and other approvals.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is publicly traded and has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSPD?p=LSPD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of about $9.4 billion</a>. It has been on an acquisition march in the last several months, with the bigger picture being to build a complete, end-to-end, one-stop-shop for customers beyond the basics of the point-of-sale software that helped the company make its name. That has also included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lightspeed-acquires-upserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Upserve in a $430 million deal in December</a> to deepen its presence in the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Ecwid itself has been around for years, initially making its name as a key partner of Facebook&#8217;s to help small businesses build commerce experiences on the social media platform, and eventually expanding to provide tools for merchants that use services like Square and Wix, as well as other third-party platforms like Instagram and Google &#8212; sometimes competing with but also potentially integrating with other e-commerce backends like Shopify.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; originally founded in Russia &#8212; had largely been under the venture radar until last year, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/ecwid-raises-42m-from-morgan-stanley-and-peakspan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $42 million</a> from Morgan Stanley and PeakSpan Capital, to double down on growth.</p>
<p>And that growth has been good. It currently has 130,000 paying customers across 100+ countries and Lightspeed said it had revenue of more than $20 million in the year that ended in March, with growth of 50% year-over-year. The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions and post-closing working capital adjustment, is expected to close during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 after the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distinction between online and brick-and-mortar retail has disappeared. Lightspeed and Ecwid, two best-in-class platforms, will unite to truly empower businesses. By eliminating the barriers merchants face when selling online, we will only more rapidly achieve our common vision of democratizing retail for independent businesses worldwide and enrich the communities they serve,&#8221; said Ruslan Fazlyev, Ecwid CEO, in a statement.</p>
<p>NuOrder, meanwhile, will help Lightspeed deepen its role in supplier relationships and transactions &#8212; an essential cornerstone in how commerce works and one where Lightspeed had already been building a business, by way of its Lightspeed Supplier Network. NuOrder has 3,000 brand and 100,000 retailer customers &#8212; some of them include Canada Goose, Converse and Arc&#8217;teryx &#8212; and Lightspeed said that some $11.5 billion in orders were made through its platform in the year that ended in March.</p>
<p>Like Ecwid, NuOrder also posted revenues of $20 million in that period; its growth rate was 30% year-over-year.</p>
<p>&#8220;At NuORDER, we have been on a journey to revolutionize retail by building a global network for brands and retailers. The coming together of Lightspeed and NuORDER accelerates that vision exponentially. The power of connected commerce comes to life now,&#8221; said NuORDER co-founders and co-CEO&#8217;s Olivia Skuza and Heath Wells in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to join forces with Lightspeed to unlock transformative value for brands and retailers globally. This represents an inflection point in the history of retail.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big micromobility news of the week revolves around <strong>Spin</strong>, and it&#8217;s not about whether or not Ford is spinning out the company; they kept a pretty tight lip on that, but clearly big changes are happening. Co-founder Derrick Ko is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">stepping down as CEO</a> and moving into an advisory role, along with his other two co-founders Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In Ko&#8217;s place is Ben Bear, who previously served as CBO of Spin.</p>
<p>Along with this news came a flurry of other announcements, but it makes sense to start with Spin&#8217;s latest public strategy for winning the e-scooter business. Spin is actively seeking out limited vendor permits with cities. In other words, the company doesn&#8217;t want to see its cities messing around with other operators. Spin is seeking exclusive partnerships and is prepared to better itself to get them. It&#8217;s positioning itself as the most desirable for cities as it shares even more news&#8230;</p>
<p>If Spin wants to have a kind of deal that Lyft-owned CitiBike has with NYC, then it needs to bring more to the table. It&#8217;s starting with e-bikes. 5,000 of them, to be specific, in the coming months, starting with Providence, RI in June and spreading outward into a few other mid-tier cities over the summer.</p>
<p>Spin is also flexing its tech that will help make its scooters safe and reliable &#8212; just what a city wants in a long-term commitment. This week, it brought its Drover AI-equipped scooters to Milwaukee (with plans to launch in Miami, Seattle and Santa Monica, as well) that are equipped to detect sidewalk and bike lane riding and validate parking. Seattle, Santa Monica and Boise, Idaho will soon be graced by Spin&#8217;s new S-200, a three-wheeled adaptive scooter built with Tortoise&#8217;s repositioning software that allows a remote operator to move scooters out of gutters or into more dense urban areas.</p>
<h3>Tier gets some more money</h3>
<p>Berlin-based <strong>Tier Mobility</strong>, which recently won a London permit, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/">raised $60 million</a> so it can expand its fleet of vehicles and battery charging networks. Technically, it&#8217;s a loan. The asset-backed financing comes from Goldman Sachs.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s talk about bikes</h3>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> has got a new e-bike piloting this month, starting in San Francisco, then Chicago and New York. It&#8217;ll be dropping the sleek, white bikes with soft purple LEDs at random around the city for people to test out. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/taking-lyfts-new-e-bike-for-a-spin/">Brian Heater gave it a spin</a>, and his general consensus was, <em>Yeah, it&#8217;s a good bike. Can&#8217;t complain.</em></p>
<p>While Lyft may have anti-theft protection on its e-bikes, the rest of us are not so lucky. According to market research company NPD Group, we saw a 63% YOY growth for bike sales in June. <a href="https://bikeindex.org/">Bike Index</a>, a national bike registry group, tells us that the number of bikes stolen has seen similar increases. The number of bikes reported stolen to the service was a little over 10,000 between April and September, compared to nearly 6,000 during the same period in the previous year. That&#8217;s an uptick of nearly 68%. So, when are apartment complexes going to be forced to build bike storage rather than car parks?</p>
<h3>Best cities for biking</h3>
<p>If you are going to risk theft and bike around, you&#8217;ll want to do it in one of the cities <a href="https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/ratings">PeopleForBikes</a> just announced are the best for biking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Topping this year&#8217;s ratings in the United States are Brooklyn, NY; Berkeley, CA and Provincetown, MA (each ranking first in the large, medium and small U.S. city categories, respectively). Top international performers include Canberra and Alice Springs in Australia; Utrecht and Groningen in the Netherlands and Gatineau, Longueuil and Montreal in Canada, all located in the province of Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biking is not all about fun and commuting. For some of us, it&#8217;s work. <strong>URB-E</strong>, the compact container delivery network that wants to replace trucks with small electric bikes, has announced PackItFresh as its final-mile refrigeration provider. PackItFresh&#8217;s totes can keep food at safe temperatures for up to 24 hours, yet another reason supermarkets need to be nixing the delivery trucks in favor of these more sustainable alternatives.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hesitate to put this one under deal of the week, because, well, the deal ain&#8217;t done. But it is interesting, and this is my show, so here we are. I&#8217;m talking about Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company, and a potential merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tl;dr for those who didn&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">catch my Friday story</a>. Several sources within the financial sector told me that Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. It appears the valuation is going to be somewhere in the $12 billion neighborhood. The deal is expected to be announced as early as next week. I should add that both Aurora and Reinivent declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with home insurance startup Hippo.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the deal could fall apart? Sure. But my sources tell me that it has progressed far enough that it would take a significant issue to derail the agreement. One more note: there is the tricky issue of Hoffman and Reinvent&#8217;s existing relationship with Aurora. Hoffman is a board member of Aurora and Reinvent is an investor. While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. Connie Loizos&#8217;s accompanying article digs into the increasing cases of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/">conflicts of interest</a> popping up in SPAC deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getir</strong>, the Istanbul-based grocery delivery app, raised $550m in new funding. This latest injection of capital, which tripled its valuation to $7.5 billion, came just three months after its last financing, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7">Financial Times reported</a>. The company, which just started to expand outside of Turkey in early 2021, is now planning a U.S. launch this year.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technology</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup building three-wheeled electric vehicles for autonomous delivery <em>or</em> human driven jaunts around town, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/">raised $4.3 million in seed funding</a> led by Trucks VC and Fifty Years.</p>
<p><strong>Flink</strong>, a Berlin-based on-demand &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery service built around self-operated dark stores and a smaller assortment (2,400 items) that it says it will deliver in 10 minutes or less, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">raised $240 million</a> to expand its business into more cities, and more countries.</p>
<p><strong>FlixMobility</strong>, the parent company of the FlixBus coach network and the FlixTrain rail service, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/">closed more than $650 million</a> in a Series G round of funding that values the Munich-based company at over $3 billion. Jochen Engert, who co-founded and co-leads the company with André Schwämmlein, described the round in a press call that TechCrunch participated in as a &#8220;balanced&#8221; mix of equity and debt, and said that the plan will be to use the funds to both expand its network in the U.S. market as well as across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Locus</strong>, a startup that uses AI to help businesses map out their logistics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/locus-raises-50-million-for-its-logistics-management-business/">raised $50 million</a> in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence. The new round, a Series C, was led by Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Qualcomm Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global Management and Falcon Edge also participated in the round, which brings the startup&#8217;s to-date raise to $79 million. The new round valued the startup, which was founded in India, at about $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Robotics</strong> announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/">$31.4 million round</a>. The funding is part of the $11.7 million Series A the company announced all the way back in late 2019. Investors include HAHN Automation, SAIC Capital Management, Soundproof Ventures , Heroic Ventures, SPARX Asset Management, Omron Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Scrum Ventures and Duke Angels.</p>
<p><strong>Roadster</strong>, the Palo Alto-based digital platform that gives dealers tools to sell new and used vehicles online has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/cdk-global-buys-vehicle-the-e-commerce-platform-roadster-for-360-million/">acquired for $360 million</a> by retail automotive technology company CDK Global Inc. As part of the all-cash deal, Roadster is now a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>
<p><strong>Sennder</strong>, a digital freight forwarder that focuses on moving cargo around Europe (and specifically focusing on trucks and &#8220;full truck load&#8221;, FTL, freight forwarding), has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised $80 million in funding</a>, at a valuation the company confirms is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota AI Ventures</strong>, Toyota&#8217;s standalone venture capital fund, dropped the &#8220;AI&#8221; and has been reborn as, simply, Toyota Ventures.

<p>Waymo has been on my mind lately — and not because of the executive departures that I wrote about last month. No, I&#8217;ve been thinking about Waymo and how, or <em>if</em>, it&#8217;s been scaling up its Waymo One driverless ride-hailing service, which operates in several Phoenix suburbs. The latest example is that Waymo One can now be accessed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/waymos-driverless-taxi-service-can-now-be-accessed-on-google-maps/">booked through Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>But what about ridership? The folks at Sensor Tower, the mobile app market intelligence firm, recently shared some numbers that give the tiniest of glimpses into who is at least interested in trying the service.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. Waymo started an early rider program in April 2017, which allowed vetted members of the public, all of whom signed NDAs, to hail an autonomous Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan. All of these Waymo-branded vans had human safety operators behind the wheel.</p>
<p>In December 2018, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Waymo One</a>, the self-driving car service and accompanying app. Waymo-trained test drivers were still behind the wheel when the ride-hailing service began. Early rider program members were the first to be invited to the service. As these folks were shifted over to the Waymo One service, the NDA was lifted.</p>
<p>The first meaningful signs that Waymo was ready to put people in vehicles without human safety operators popped up in fall 2019. TechCrunch contributor Ed Niedermeyer was among the first (media) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo/">hail a driverless ride</a>. These driverless rides were limited and free. And importantly, still fell under the early rider program, which had that extra NDA protection. Waymo slowly scaled until about 5 to 10% of its total rides in 2020 were fully driverless for its exclusive group of early riders under NDA. Then COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company announced that members of Waymo One — remember this is the sans NDA service — would be able to take family and friends along on their fully driverless rides in the Phoenix area. Existing Waymo One members were given first access to the driverless rides. The company started to welcome more people directly into the service through its app, which is available on Google Play and the App Store.</p>
<p>Waymo said that 100% of its rides would be fully driverless, which it has maintained. Today, anyone can download the app and hail a driverless ride.</p>
<p>OK, back to the numbers. Sensor Tower shared monthly estimates for Waymo&#8217;s installs from the U.S. App Store and Google Play. The company said that most of the installs are on iOS, as it looks like the Waymo app only became available on Android in April 2021. This isn&#8217;t a ridership number. It does show how interest has grown, and picked up since February 2021.</p>

<p>Hi folks, welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>Another infrastructure bill was proposed in Washington this week. The <strong>House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure</strong> introduced a new bill that would invest $547 billion over the next five years on surface transport. While much of those funds would go toward improving America&#8217;s roads, bridges, and passenger rail, the INVEST in America Act would dedicate around $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and around $4 billion to invest in zero-emission transit vehicles.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that&#8217;s in addition to major infrastructure bills already proposed by President Joe Biden and House Democrats. It&#8217;s likely that this bill, should it pass, would be significantly scaled back &#8212; just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/the-station-rivian-rolls-towards-an-ipo-and-quantumscape-makes-a-big-battery-hire/">Congressional Republicans</a> are attempting to do with Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plan. You can read more about the bill <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/">here</a>.</p>
<p>President Biden has set his sights on battery manufacturing as a way to recover and reuse critical minerals in the EV supply chain. This is after it was reported that he walked back earlier signals that he might support domestic mining for these minerals, like lithium. Instead, it looks like his plan is to push for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-bidens-electric-vehicle-plan-includes-battery-recycling-push-2021-06-04/">continued importing of the metals</a> from foreign countries and then to recycle and reuse them at the end of a battery&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>This news is a blow to America&#8217;s mining industry but sure to be a boost for metal recyclers, like Redwood Materials in Nevada and Canadian company Li-Cycle, which is expanding its operations in the States.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest pushback against mining has come from environmental and conservation groups. A good example is the situation currently unfolding out in Nevada, where a proposed lithium mine may be halted due to the presence of a rare wildflower. Conservation groups want to get protected status for the flower. If they succeed? No more mine.</p>
<p>The final piece of news this week is a recent survey from <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> which found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/">51% of Americans</a> oppose phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. The report also found that those reported hearing &#8220;a lot&#8221; about EVs were more likely to seriously consider one for their next vehicle purchase. Also, while Americans are roughly in agreement that EVs are better for the environment, they&#8217;re equally in agreement that they&#8217;re more costly.</p>
<p>The upshot is that more and more Americans are coming around to the idea of EVs and the question of their benefits (on the environment, for example) is pretty well understood. But policymakers and OEMs clearly still have a ways to go in convincing a huge swathe of Americans to get on board.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be providing the looooonnnnggggg roundup of news this week, but here are a few little bits including some hires and other tidbits.</p>
<p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> said it plans to install <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/7-eleven-to-install-500-ev-charging-stations-by-the-end-of-2022/">500 direct-current fast charging ports</a> at 250 locations across North America by the end of 2022. These charging ports will be owned and operated by 7-Eleven, as opposed to fuel at its filling stations, which must be purchased from suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>Baraja</strong>, the lidar startup, appointed former Magna and DaimlerChrysler veterans to its executive team, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauleichenberg/">Paul Eichenberg</a> as chief strategy officer and Jim Kane as vp of automotive engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Heater</strong>, hardware editor here at TechCrunch, covered a recent gathering of ride-hailing drivers in Long Island City, Queens. The group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/rideshare-drivers-gather-in-nyc-in-hopes-of-unionizing/">protested outside of Uber&#8217;s offices</a> ahead of a proposed state bill. The drivers support the proposed bill that would make it easy for gig economy workers in the state to unionize.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">secured a permit</a> that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The permit, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important &#8212; and Cruise is the first to land this particular one &#8212; but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.</p>
<p><strong>DeepMap</strong> has developed a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deepmap-announces-roadmemory-a-highly-scalable-and-economical-mapping-service-enabling-hands-off-driving-everywhere-301304788.html">crowdsourced mapping service</a> called RoadMemory that lets automakers turn data collected from their own fleets of passenger vehicles and trucks into maps. The company says the tool is designed to expand geographic coverage more quickly and support hands-off autonomous driving features everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> is partnering with REEF Technology, one of the country&#8217;s largest parking garage operators, and a real estate acquisition company Neighborhood Property Group to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/joby-aviation-targets-parking-garages-for-its-aerial-ridesharing-network/">build out its network of vertiports</a>, with an initial focus on Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Populus</strong>, the platform that helps cities manage shared mobility services, streets and curbs, launched a new <a href="https://www.populus.ai/latest-news/populus-expands-data-sharing-solutions-for-carsharing-in-oakland">digital car-sharing parking feature</a> in Oakland. The gist is that this feature helps cities collect data on car-sharing and deploy curbside paying payments. The company launched this particular product in 2018 and has been expanding to different cities.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/former-head-of-alphabets-loon-joins-starship-technologies-as-new-ceo/">hired a new CEO</a>. The company tapped Alastair Westgarth, the former CEO of Alphabet&#8217;s Loon, to lead the company as it looks to expand its robotics delivery service. Loon, Alphabet&#8217;s experiment to deliver broadband via high-altitude balloons, was shut down for good at the beginning of this year. Prior to working at Loon, Westgarth headed the wireless antennae company Quintel Solutions, was a vice president at telecommunications company Nortel and director of engineering at Bell Mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri Suzuki</strong>, a partner at design consultancy firm Pentagram, recently conducted a research project into the crucial role electric car sound has on a user&#8217;s safety, enjoyability, communication and brand recognition, out of which he developed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/pentagram-cuts-through-the-noise-of-ev-sound-design/">range of car sounds</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people in emerging markets depend on informal public transport to move across cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while there are ride-hailing and bus-hailing applications in some of these cities, there&#8217;s a dire need for journey-planning apps to improve mobility for users and reduce the time they spend commuting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African-founded startup <a href="https://www.whereismytransport.com/">WhereIsMyTransport</a> is one such company filling that gap for now. Today, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t is announcing a $14.5 million Series A extension to continue its expansion across emerging markets; the company already has a presence in South Africa and Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, via its investment arm, Naspers Foundry, co-led the investment with Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Naspers, the size of its check was $3 million. Japan&#8217;s SBI Investment also participated in the round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension round is coming a year after WhereIsMyTransport <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/28/google-toyota-invest-in-whereismytransport-to-map-transport-in-emerging-cities/">received a $7.5 million Series A investment</a> from VC firms and strategic investment from Google, Nedbank, and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devin de Vries, Chris King and Dave New started the company in 2015. As a mobility startup, WhereIsMyTransport maps formal and informal public transport networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company then uses data gotten to improve the public transport experience, making commute safe and accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this, WhereIsMyTransport licenses some of this data to governments, DFIs, NGOs, operators, and third-party developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research, analytics, insights and consumer and enterprise solutions purposes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority world,&#8221; said CEO Devin de Vries in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we covered the company, it had mapped 34 cities in Africa while actively mapping some in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, it expanded into Mexico City last November and has completed multiple data production projects in the city alongside Lima, Bangkok, Gauteng, Dhaka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Right now, the company has worked in 41 cities across 28 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhereIsMyTransport also launched its first consumer product Rumbo which provides network information from all modes of public transport in Mexico with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 100,000 users delivering over 750,000 real-time network alerts. The company says there are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to launch Rumbo in Lima, Peru, later this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For co-lead investor Naspers Foundry, this is the firm&#8217;s first investment in mobility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has funded four other South African startups &#8212; Aerobotics, SweepSouth, Food Supply Network, and The Student Hub &#8212; with a focus on edtech, food and cleaning sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t pass on the opportunity to back an extraordinary South African founder who has built his business here in Cape Town to a global market leader in mapping formal and informal transportation with a strong focus on emerging markets,&#8221; Head of Naspers Foundry Fabian Whate said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also adds that there is an overlap between mobility and the food and e-commerce businesses that seem to be Naspers main focus from a Naspers perspective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The global food and e-commerce businesses, often operating in emerging markets, are quite reliant on mobility solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there&#8217;s a great overlap between what the Naspers Group does and the vision for WhereIsMyTransport</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, WhereIsMyTransport’s clients include Johannesburg commuter rail system Gautrain and Transport for Cape Town</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its international client base Google, the World Bank and WSP, and others.</span></p>
<p>South Africa CEO of Naspers, Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa, said:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Mobility remains an obstacle for billions of people in high-growth markets across the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our investment in WhereIsMyTransport is a testimony of our belief that great innovation and tech talent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa, and with the right backing and support, these businesses can provide solutions to local challenges that can improve the lives of ordinary people in South Africa and abroad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France&#8217;s competition watchdog, <em>L’Autorité de la concurrence</em>, has fined Google up to €220 million (~$268M) in a case related to self-preferencing within the adtech market which the watchdog found constituted an abuse by Google of a dominant position for ad servers for website publishers and mobile apps.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>began looking into Google&#8217;s adtech business following complaints from a number of French publishers.</p>
<p>Today it <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">said</a> Google had requested a settlement &#8212; and is &#8220;not disputing the facts of the case&#8221; &#8212; with the tech giant proposing certain &#8216;interoperability&#8217; commitments that the regulator has accepted, and which will form a binding part of <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/decision/relative-des-pratiques-mises-en-oeuvre-dans-le-secteur-de-la-publicite-sur-internet-0">the decision</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The watchdog called the action a world first in probing Google&#8217;s complex algorithmic ad auctions.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, <em>L&#8217;Autorité&#8217;</em>s president<em>,</em> Isabelle de Silva, said: &#8220;The decision sanctioning Google has a very special meaning because it is the first decision in the world to look into complex algorithmic processes. Auctions through which online display advertising works. The investigation, carried out particularly quickly, revealed the processes by which Google, relying on its considerable dominant position on ad servers for sites and applications, was favored over its competitors on both ad servers and SSP platforms. These very serious practices penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position. This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to restore a level playing field for all players, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising space. &#8221;</p>
<p>At specific issue is preferential treatment Google granted to its own proprietary technologies &#8212; offered under the Google Ad Manager brand &#8212; on both the demand and supply sides; via the operation of its DFP [DoubleClick For Publishers] ad server (which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their spaces advertising), and its sales platform SSP AdX (which organizes the auction process allowing publishers to sell their &#8216;impressions&#8217; or advertising inventories to advertisers), per the watchdog.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">found</a> that Google&#8217;s preferential treatment of its adtech harmed competitors and publishers.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokeswoman referred us to this <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-ad-technology/">blog post</a> discussing the settlement where Maria Gomri, a legal director for Google France, writes that it has &#8220;agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data and use our tools with other ad technologies&#8221; &#8212; before detailing the steps it has pledged to take.</p>
<p>The publishing groups that made the original complaint against Google in France were News Corp Inc., the Le Figaro group and the Rossel La Voix group, although Le Figaro withdrew its referral last November &#8212; at the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-google-copyrights-idINKBN27Z27B">same time as it signed a content-licensing deal with Google</a>, related to Google&#8217;s News Showcase product (a vehicle Google has spun up as legislators in different markets around the world have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">taken steps to force it to pay</a> for some content reuse).</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">earlier</a> ordered Google to negotiate with publishers over remuneration for reuse of their content, following the transposing into national law of updated, pan-EU copyright rules &#8212; which extend neighbouring rights to publishers&#8217; news snippets. So the adtech giant&#8217;s operations remain under scrutiny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">on that front too</a>.</p>
<h2>Google agrees to interoperability changes</h2>
<p>Google has agreed to improve the interoperability of Google Ad Manager services with third-party ad server and advertising space sales platform solutions, per <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>, as well as agreeing to end provisions that favor itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The practices in question are particularly serious because they penalized Google&#8217;s competitors in the SSP market and the publishers of sites and mobile applications,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">press release</a> (translated from French with Google Translate). &#8220;Among these, the press groups &#8212; including those who were [the source] of the referral to the Authority &#8212; were affected even though their economic model is also strongly weakened by the decline in sales of paper subscriptions and the decline in associated advertising revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> confirmed it has accepted Google&#8217;s commitments &#8212; and makes them binding in its decision. The commitments will be mandatory for a three year period, <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">per the agreement</a>.</p>
<p>The commitments Google has offered appear to speak to some operational details that have emerged via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Texas antitrust lawsuit also targeting Google&#8217;s adtech</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, documents surfaced via that suit which appeared to show the tech giant operated a secret program that used data from past bids in its digital ad exchange to allegedly give its own ad-buying system an advantage over competitors, per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760">WSJ</a> &#8212; which reported that the so-called &#8216;Project Bernanke&#8217; program was not disclosed to publishers who sold ads through Google&#8217;s exchange.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Texas leads ten states in lawsuit over Google&#8217;s ad business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/embed/#?secret=nYdrwaXCyV" data-secret="nYdrwaXCyV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the area of data access, Google has committed to the <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>to devise a solution to ensure that all buyers which use Google Ad Manager to participate in its ad exchange receive equal access to data from its auctions &#8212; &#8220;to help them efficiently buy ad space from publishers&#8221;. Including when publishers use an off-platform technique called &#8216;Header Bidding&#8217; (which enables publishers to run an auction among multiple ad exchanges but which, as a result of how Google operates, has meant such buyers may be at a data disadvantage vs those participating through Google&#8217;s own platform).</p>
<p>Google claims it is &#8220;usually not technically possible&#8221; for it to identify participants in Header Bidding auctions, and thus that it cannot share data with those buyers. But it&#8217;s now committed to address that by working &#8220;to create a solution that ensures that all buyers that a publisher works with, including those who participate in Header Bidding, can receive equal access to data related to outcomes from the Ad Manager auction&#8221;.</p>
<p>It notes that &#8220;in particular&#8221; it will be &#8220;providing information around the &#8216;minimum bid to win&#8217; from previous auctions&#8221;, going forward &#8212; which would address one disadvantageous blind-spot for publishers taking an off-platform route to try to earn more ad revenue.</p>
<p>Another commitment from Google to the French watchdog is a pledge to increase flexibility for publishers using its Ad Manager product &#8212; including by letting them set custom pricing rules for ads that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en&quot;}">sensitive categories</a> and implementing product changes aimed at improving interoperability between Ad Manager and third-party ad servers.</p>
<p>Google also writes that it is &#8220;reaffirming&#8221; that it won&#8217;t limit Ad Manager publishers from negotiating specific terms or pricing directly with other sell-side platforms (SSPs); and says it is committing to continue to provide publishers with controls to include or exclude certain buyers at their discretion when they use its product.</p>
<p>The third batch of commitments focus on transparency &#8212; and the opacity of adtech has long been a core criticism of the market, including for the competitive dimension as unclear workings by dominant platforms can be used to shield abusive practices from view. (Indeed, <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> already fined Google $166M back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/france-slaps-google-with-166m-antitrust-fine-for-opaque-and-inconsistent-ad-rules/">December 2019</a> for having what it billed then as “opaque and difficult to understand” rules for its ad platform, Google Ads, and for applying them in “an unfair and random manner.”)</p>
<p>On transparency, Google has pledged not to use data from other SSPs to optimize bids in its own exchange in a way that other SSPs can’t reproduce. It also says it&#8217;s reupping a promise not to share any bid from any Ad Manager auction participants with any other auction participant prior to completion of the auction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, we’ll give publishers at least three months&#8217; notice for major changes requiring significant implementation effort that publishers must adopt, unless those are related to security or privacy protections, or are required by law,&#8221; it further notes.</p>
<p>The commitments made to <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>will apply to how Google operates its adtech in the French market &#8212; but are also set to be applied more widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally,&#8221; Gomri added in the blog post.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>&#8216;s action comes after years of attention paid to the online advertising market.</p>
<p>Back in 2018 it published a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/sites/default/files/integral_texts/2019-10/avis18a03_en_.pdf">report</a> that delved into a number of competitive advantages leveraged by Facebook and Google, noting how the duopoly&#8217;s ad targeting offerings benefit from their leadership positions in respective markers and the resultant network effects; and also from their vertical integration model (playing in both publishing and technical intermediation); as well as from the &#8216;logged&#8217; environments both have developed, requiring users to log in to access &#8216;free&#8217; services &#8212; giving them access to a high volume of sociodemographic and behavioral data to power their ad targeting products, among other competitive advantages.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has also conducted an online ad market study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">in recent years</a> &#8212; findings from which are underpinning &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; regulatory reform that&#8217;s now being targeted at tech giants with &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; which will, in the future, be subject to an ex ante regime of custom requirements aimed at preemptively preventing market abuse.</p>
<p>The European Commission has, meanwhile, issued multiple antitrust enforcements against Google&#8217;s business in recent years &#8212; including a $1.7BN fine related to its search ad brokering business, AdSense,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/"> in 2019</a>, and a $2.7BN penalty for its price comparison service, Google Shopping, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">2017</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>More recently, the EU regulators have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-antitrust-eu-idUSKBN29P23U">reported</a> to be further probing Google&#8217;s adtech practices. So more interventions could be forthcoming.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s preferred approach of not imposing specific remedies itself &#8212; nor obtaining specific commitments, beyond a general requirement not to continue the sanctioned abuse (or any equivalent behavior) &#8212; seems to have failed to move the needle, certainly where Google&#8217;s market dominance is concerned.</p>
<p>Still, EU lawmakers&#8217; experience with Google antitrust cases has certainly informed a recent pan-EU plan for a set of ex ante rules to apply to digital &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; &#8212; incoming under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which was presented by Brussels last December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014 Alexis Patjane was at a local hookah bar in Mexico City with some friends and the bar ran out of tobacco. They thought maybe they could buy some online and have it delivered to the bar in real-time, but it turns out that service didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Patjane was running a food truck-making business, which was responsible for about 80% of all the food trucks in Mexico, so he had experience doing business in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of weeks later, to solve the instant delivery problem he had faced at the hookah bar, Patjane launched 99 minutos, a website that sold products and delivered them within 99 minutes, hence the name.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 99 minutos announced a $40 million Series B from Prosus and Kaszek Ventures which it plans to use to grow its business in Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently operates within 40 major markets across Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru and offers four services: less than 99 minutes delivery, same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and CO2-free delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What started as an e-commerce company with fast delivery quickly became a last-mile delivery service for other e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started to build the API connections and plug-ins, and any e-commerce could add our delivery service to their business,” Patjane told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">99 minutos makes money by charging the customer a flat fee for delivery and then offering the driver a flat rate as well, but today, the volume is so large on each route, that it’s become very lucrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ship about 60-80 packages per route,” Patjane said, and from the consumer’s perspective, the delivery app works similarly to Waze. “You can pause the delivery, you can change the address. You can say, “Oh, I’m not at home, I’m at the Starbucks on the corner, can you drop it off there?”’ he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patjane said that initially, the company offered delivery only within Mexico City, but it quickly grew to offer its services between cities and now operates between 21 cities in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-commerce is growing quickly in Latin America, but it is still [the] early days. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is at 6%, while China is reaching 30% and the U.S. is at 20%,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we hear big e-commerce players saying that 99 minutos is ‘their most reliable partner’ and that they are ‘the provider with the most potential,’ it tells us that the team is executing extremely well and is on a path to disrupt e-commerce delivery in Latin America,” said Banafsheh Fathieh, Head of Americas Investments at Prosus Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the funds will also be to speed up their city-to-city deliveries. “We’ll be doing same day [delivery] from city to city and will be using small aircraft to connect the cities,” Patjane said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos is going to be one of the passengers on his spaceflight company Blue Origin&#8217;s first ever human space launch on July 20. The Amazon founder announced the news via his Instagram on Monday morning, revealing that his brother Mark will also be coming along for the ride. Bezos and his brother will join the winner of an online auction Blue Origin is currently hosting, which currently stands at $2.8 million as the highest bid for that seat.</p>
<p>The Blue Origin launch of its suborbital, reusable New Shepard rocket on July 20 will be the first time it has ever flown with people on board. It&#8217;s unusual for a company to make its first ever human spaceflight a mission with a paying passenger, and now we know that it&#8217;s also going to be carrying one of the world&#8217;s richest people, another bold choice for a first human flight. Virgin Galactic, by contrast, has flown to space multiple times with test pilots and astronauts before its forthcoming trip with Sir Richard Branson. Elon Musk has also never flown on a SpaceX launch, though he has suggested in the past that he will fly on one of his company&#8217;s vehicles at some point.</p>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard has flown plenty of times without people, however, and save for the first flight where the reusable booster was lost, has had a complete success for each of those 15 missions, including landing of the booster (except that first time) and recovery of the capsule (for all of the launches). The New Shepard rocket doesn&#8217;t go all the way to orbit, but instead flies to the edge of space, where passengers experience a few minutes of weightlessness and an unbeatable view of Earth through the capsules many windows, before returning to a parachute-assisted landing on the ground in Texas near Blue Origin&#8217;s launch site.</p>
<p>The auction for Blue Origin&#8217;s first paying customer seat currently sits at $2.8 million, and it&#8217;s been there for a while now after the price raised from $1.4 million when Blue Origin opened unsealed bidding on May 19. The final phase of the auction, set for June 12, will include live online bidding from remaining participants who bump their existing bid to match the high offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of Google&#8217;s strong advantages in the world of online video has been the sheer size of YouTube: currently, the site has more than 2.3 billion monthly active users and over 500 hours of content uploaded every minute. Now, Google and YouTube are hoping to leverage some of that heft as it goes head to head with TikTok.</p>
<p>Shorts, YouTube&#8217;s TikTok rival for building 60-second videos set to music that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched first in India</a> and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded to the U.S.</a>, is now opening up in three more regions &#8212; the UK, Canada and Latin America. And alongside that, YouTube is turning on a new feature: users will now be able to dip into the wider YouTube catalogue when creating their videos.</p>
<p>The rollout to new countries is starting today and will be fully live by the end of June, a spokesperson tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The geographic and feature expansions underscore how Google continues to double down on the shorter video format to capture some of the audience that might otherwise go to TikTok &#8212; or, indeed, rival products from the likes of Instagram (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a>), Snapchat (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>) or others &#8212; for their quick-shot fix.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how well that is playing out in terms of engagement or creators just yet: YouTube tells me that the YouTube Shorts player &#8212; which appears as a bar on the YouTube app &#8212; now has passed 6.5 billion daily views in the countries where it is available.</p>
<p>YouTube is not disclosing creator numbers, nor is it disclosing active user numbers of Shorts itself. (But it has definitely built out a channel for incentivizing them: last month it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $100 million creators fund</a> to lure more people to build content in its new channel.)</p>
<p>The company declined to say whether it plans to launch a standalone Shorts app at any point, but it&#8217;s in the process of improving user experience for people through the YouTube app. You can now scroll vertically from one Short to the next, not unlike how you would on TikTok, and you can get to Shorts directly from a tab on the app.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2161955,2161956,2161957,2161958"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shorts is still technically in beta, and so it&#8217;s to be expected that YouTube will be adding in a lot of new features in the coming months as it watches how it gets picked up, or what people decry is lacking.</p>
<p>YouTube tells me, for example, that the ability to sample licensed music had been getting slowly expanded and rolled out in India and the U.S. in the past few weeks. If you are able to access shorts UK and you get access to Shorts as of today, you will be able to use the audio feature, too.</p>
<p>That licensed music trove now numbers millions of songs, YouTube said, from <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">250 labels and publishers, including Universal Music Group’s labels and publishing companies, Sony Music Entertainment and Publishing, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Because Music, Merlin, Beggars, Ditto, AEI, The State51, Kobalt and more. (To be clear: this was the same number and list that it had last month, no new updates there.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to this, YouTube has added in other features since it launched. For example, it now lets creators add text, captions and graphics overlays on Shorts videos; sample audio from other Shorts; clips from your phone&#8217;s gallery; and filters for color correction &#8212; a template that will be expanded with more effects over time, YouTube said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But within that context, it will be interesting to see the impact of adding audio and video from across all of YouTube &#8212; we&#8217;re talking billions of videos here &#8212; will have on how Shorts gets used and how it evolves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This will mean not only music from creators, but all kinds of video segments that may have already gone viral, or may get their 15 minutes of fame as a result of one great Short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Conversely, Shorts viewers and would-be creators will also be able to click through directly to the original content, and information about a creator, that was used in a Short &#8212; a key detail that should matter to those who have felt that originators of memes, dances, songs and other creator content sometimes get lost in the mix in a lot of what you see on viral video content platforms like TikTok&#8217;s (although it too has made it easier to find and link through, and credit original creators).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The network effect for a platform like YouTube is particularly compelling here, if the right audience takes YouTube up on what it is offering to them. At a time when TikTok remains a relatively new phenomenon, and there remains the question over how regulators will treat the Chinese-owned app longer term in countries like the U.S., there is a lot still to play for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is the predominant method of sending and receiving payments in the Middle East. If you owe someone a cup of coffee or a trip over a long period, repaying via cash is your best bet. This is one problem out of many financial issues that haven&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been addressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that startups are springing up to provide solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month Telda, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now two-month-old startup</a> in Egypt, raised an impressive sum as pre-seed to offer digital banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.ziina.com/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6yILv-ITxAhXwyYUKHcRnCncQFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i4nN5d3iZddlUw_WDJ-Ns">Ziina</a>, another startup based in Dubai, has closed $7.5 million in seed funding to scale its peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service across the Middle East and North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has managed to enlist top global investors and fintech founders in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Avenir Growth and Class 5 Global led this latest tranche of financing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wamda Capital, FJ Labs, Graph Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Jabbar Internet Group, Oman Technology Fund’s Jasoor Ventures, and ANIM also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders who took part include Checkout CEO Guillaume Pousaz via his investment fund Zinal Growth; Krishnan Menon, BukuKas CEO, as well as executives from Paypal and Venmo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This adds to a roster of executives and early employees from Revolut, Stripe, Brex, Notion, and Deel that joined Ziina’s round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, it has raised over $8.6 million since launching last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes the $850,000 pre-seed raised in May 2020 and $125,000 secured after going through Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter batch early this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Faisal Toukan, Sarah Toukan, and Andrew Gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the latest addition to the Middle East’s bubbling fintech ecosystem and is capitalising on the region&#8217;s rapid adoption of fintech friendly regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company allows users to send and receive payments with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a phone number —no IBAN or swift code required as is the de facto method in the UAE and some parts of the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting during a hackathon in the U.S., Faisal and Gold began exchanging ideas on how to build wallets, wanting to mirror the successes platforms like WePay, Paytm have had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, VCs seemed to be interested in how the wallets ecosystem intersected with banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The lines between wallets and banking have become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blurred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wallet has a banking partner, and people who use wallets use them for their day-to-day needs,&#8221; CEO Faisal Toukan said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah, who is Faisal&#8217;s sister, was on her personal fintech journey in London. There, she attended several meetups headlined by the founders of Monzo and Revolut. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her knowledge and the experience of the other two, the founders decided that solving P2P payments issues was their own way of driving massive impact in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how far have they gone? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched a beta for the market that&#8217;s restricted for regulatory reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Toukan remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the process of getting regulated. We&#8217;ve got a banking partner, one of the three largest banks in the UAE, and we&#8217;ve set a new wallet to launch a month from now. That&#8217;s also what we were working throughout our period in YC. So it&#8217;s been quite an eventful year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech sector in MENA is growing fast; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> numbers, at a CAGR of 30%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in the UAE, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast">estimated</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast"> that over 450 fintech companies will raise about $2 billion in 2022</a> compared to the $80 million raised in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fintechs in the region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on solving payments, transfers, and remittances. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside its P2P offering, these are the areas Ziina wants to play in, including investment and cryptocurrency services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Toukan, there&#8217;s no ease of making online investments, and remittances </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in exchange houses, a manual process where people need to visit an office physically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So what we&#8217;re looking to do is to bring all these products to life in the UAE and expand beyond that. But the first pain point we&#8217;re solving for is for people to send and receive money with two clicks,&#8221; the CEO affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with P2P has its own advantages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, peer-to-peer services is a repeat behavioural mechanism that allows companies to establish trust with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it&#8217;s a cheaper customer acquisition model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toukan says that as Zinna expands </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2022; and Egypt and Tunisia some years from now &#8212; as he wants the company&#8217;s wallet to become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamless across borders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want a situation where if you move into Saudi or Dubai, you&#8217;re able to use the same wallet versus using different banking applications,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be on the right side of regulation is key to any fintech expansion, and Toukan says Ziina has been in continuous dialogue with regulators to operate efficiently. But some challenges have stemmed from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding the right banking partners. &#8220;You need to make a case to the banks that this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mutually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beneficial partnership. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the way we&#8217;ve done that is by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting different cases globally like CashApp that worked with Southern Bank,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the company has moved past that challenge, it&#8217;s in full swing to launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ziina has thousands of users who transacted more than $120,000 on the platform this past month.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition, there are over 20,000 users on its waiting list to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be onboarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has already built a team with experience across tech companies like Apple, Uber, Stanford, Coinbase, Careem, Oracle, and Yandex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to double down on hiring with this new investment and customer acquisition and establishing commercial partnerships</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
