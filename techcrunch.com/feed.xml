										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.umba.com/">Umba</a>, a digital bank for emerging markets and aiming first at Africa, has secured a $2 million seed funding round from new investors including Lachy Groom, ex-Head of Issuing at Stripe; Ludlow Ventures; Frontline Ventures and Act Venture.</p>
<p>Currently operating in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kenya" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kenya">Kenya <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Nigeria, Umba offers a digital financial service alternative to legacy African banks. Its mobile app gives customers a free checking account, free instant peer-to-peer money transfers, lending, deposits, BillPay and cashback. This is in contrast to the generally high-cost barriers found among traditional banking institutions in African countries.</p>
<p>Right now it’s available in Kenya and Nigeria, which have a combined population of over a quarter of a billion people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Umba competes with Kudao, Carbon, Eversend and &#8216;Chip or cash’ methods.</p>
<p>Umba’s CEO, Tiernan Kennedy said: “From the outset we built our platform to serve multiple markets, currencies and payment infrastructures. This flexibility is an extremely important consideration as it’s much harder to upgrade your systems at a later date. For example, bank and debit card penetration is high in Nigeria, so Umba is deeply integrated into those payment methods, while across Kenya and East Africa mobile money is dominant so our platform is tightly integrated with those services, too.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ludlow-ventures-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ludlow-ventures-llc">Ludlow Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Partner, Brett DeMarrais said: “Umba is the first investment we’ve made in the African market and it’s one we were excited to participate in. The team at Umba have an excellent service that drives down the cost of banking for their customers and democratizes access. The move away from physical branch infrastructure was already underway and it has accelerated this year. It’s clear the African market is maturing and that we’re entering a very interesting phase.”</p>
<p>The news comes shortly after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> $200M acquisition of Nigerian payment service startup Paystack as well as the acquisition of DPO Group for $288m and Sendwave for $500m, showing a booming ecosystem breaking records in venture rounds and acquisitions.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast (<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For the first time in donkey&#8217;s years, we didn&#8217;t have our full crew this week. Instead, we had just <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">myself</a> &#8212; we had to survive without <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> while he took the week &#8220;off&#8221; to &#8220;relax.&#8221;</p>
<p>But our depleted ranks did not mean that news was waiting for us to reassemble. Indeed, there was a mass of stuff to get through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta-based Presso <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/dry-cleaning-robotics-startup-presso-raises-1-6m-as-it-shifts-focus-to-hollywood/">raised $1.6 million</a> for its in-unit dry cleaning tech, which we thought was neat.</li>
<li>OpenSensors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/opensensors-secures-4m-for-air-monitoring-platform-which-allows-offices-to-be-more-covid-safe/">raised $4 million</a> for its air-monitoring tech after a history of bootstrapping.</li>
<li>Lantern, which helps folks plan for their death, is having a big year. It <a href="https://lantern.co/">raised $1.4 million</a>.</li>
<li>Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">raised $65 million</a>, the same week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">Robinhood came under fire</a> by the Massachusetts securities group, and the SEC. Robinhood will pay $65 million to settle the SEC&#8217;s charges without admitting wrongdoing.</li>
<li>In the world of product, we chatted about <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/new-reader-homepage">Substack&#8217;s new Reader service</a>, which we seem to like. (We also chatted about <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/journalists-will-learn-influencing-isnt-easy/">this</a> Taylor Lorenz piece.)</li>
<li>It was also prime season to chat a little about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">what&#8217;s new in the Bitcoin world</a>, and take a peek at the stock market&#8217;s recent over-success. Roblox, see you in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for everyone who made it to the end, here are the pieces <a href="https://www.axios.com/creators-income-revenue-snapchat-cameo-substack-66457b1b-a9ab-4065-b0c6-58baa81edec4.html">from Axios</a> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/onlyfans-is-not-only-popular-but-hugely-profitable">and The Information</a> that we mentioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, perhaps the best-known American crypto company, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-b140a9dfc9f5">announced</a> today that it has filed confidentially to go public. The company&#8217;s debut was expected, having been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/">reported earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>As the well-funded unicorn has filed confidentially, its debut looks to be an early-2021 affair. What sort of flotation the company will pursue is not clear at this stage. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coinbase">Coinbase&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announcement is anodyne, as releases of this sort tend to be. The text of the short blog post does not mention whether Coinbase will pursue a traditional IPO or direct listing, but Slack&#8217;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190204005225/en/">similar message</a> from early 2019 was similarly devoid of information; Slack went public via a direct listing last year before agreeing recently to sell to Salesforce.</p>
<p>Coinbase raised extensive known capital while private, including a $300 million Series E in October of 2018. Its August, 2017 Series D was worth a hair over $100 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase">according to Crunchbase data</a>. Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth and IVP are among the investors that led rounds into the crypto-focused fintech company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TeO6HCxgtp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/">Coinbase reported to consider late 2020, early 2021 public debut</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coinbase reported to consider late 2020, early 2021 public debut&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/coinbase-reported-to-consider-late-2020-early-2021-public-debut/embed/#?secret=TeO6HCxgtp" data-secret="TeO6HCxgtp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It is not clear how large Coinbase&#8217;s revenues have grown, or how profitable or not its operations have proven in recent years. While there has been some reporting about its historical growth, how the company has fared more recently is opaque. Therefore, how well Coinbase&#8217;s impending public valuation will compare to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/coinbase-series-e--25f6f746">$8 billion private valuation</a> is hard to guess.</p>
<p>The company is going public amidst a surge of interest in cryptocurrencies, the prices of many having risen in recent months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">TechCrunch explored the trend earlier today.</a></p>
<p>Coinbase has also been in a number of controversial spots in 2020, including the loss of dozens of employees after its CEO declared that the company would not participate in any political matters that were not, in his view, directly tied to the company&#8217;s mission.<b> </b>The ensuing dialogue about the company&#8217;s decision <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/working-for-social-justice-isnt-a-distraction-for-mission-focused-companies/">was loud</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Roblox and Affirm now taking an early-2021 tack for their own IPOs, we can add Coinbase to the list of companies we expect to float in January.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaysundaram/">Vijay Sundaram</a> is the Chief Strategy Officer of Zoho Corporation, the parent company of ManageEngine. He leads or is involved in multiple functional areas from corporate strategy and execution to channel management, business development and enterprise sales.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As consumers, most of us <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/cybersecurity-protect-me.html">don’t mind providing companies</a> like Google, Facebook and Twitter with our personal data, as long as we get access to the services and solutions we want to use. However, many people don’t realize that these companies function as data-collecting surveillance organizations, integrating data collection into their business models in clandestine ways.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to users, many companies allow third parties to place embed codes on their websites, capturing user behavior to either harvest or sell to other parties. This practice of &#8220;adjunct surveillance,&#8221; as Zoho Chief Evangelist Raju Vegesna describes it, has become common practice given a lack of resistance from users, investors and other business leaders.</p>
<p>To anyone paying attention, it has become painfully evident that the surveillance pendulum has swung too far. Companies are collecting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">and sharing</a> user data with impunity. In fact, adjunct surveillance has become so egregious that a wave of data privacy laws has sprung up in recent years: the EU&#8217;s GDPR, California&#8217;s CCPA, New York&#8217;s SHIELD Act and Brazil&#8217;s LGPD, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s time for tech leaders to take a stand by formally, and visibly, taking a privacy pledge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Due to increased government regulation and public awareness, business leaders are starting to see the writing on the wall. However, it&#8217;s not enough to rely on lawmakers and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/">regulators&#8217; activity</a>. It is also not enough to be<em> legally</em> compliant, burying the notices in legalese or fine print. Such Machiavellian maneuvers may technically be legal, but they&#8217;re certainly not moral.</p>
<p>It’s time for tech leaders to take a stand by formally, and visibly, taking a privacy pledge.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t let advertising companies track your users without their knowledge</h2>
<p>Even if your business depends upon selling user data to third-party advertisers, it is vital that you inform your users about what you&#8217;re doing with their data. In some cases, it very well may be legal to withhold such information from users; however, that doesn&#8217;t make it right.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1996, ManageEngine — then doing business as Zoho — has refused to allow any third-party advertisements on any of its websites or products. In an effort to block all adjunct surveillance, they don&#8217;t allow the embedding of any third-party tracking codes anywhere on their sites. Although social media share buttons may seem innocuous, they should be removed as well, as the buttons can essentially function as Trojan horses.</p>
<h2>Inform your customers about any third-party integrations that may track their data</h2>
<p>If your enterprise is financially reliant on such activity, it needs to be transparent about it. Take Google as an example: Many of us don&#8217;t have a problem using Gmail because we value the service enough to provide the search behemoth with our data. However, when Google leverages our user data to enter into partnerships with credit card and healthcare companies on the sly, that is a different story entirely.</p>
<p>Google partnered with Ascension hospitals back in 2018 on &#8220;Project Nightingale,&#8221; a data-sharing initiative that was not revealed to Ascension patients. Although subsequent investigations found that Google had not technically violated HIPAA, or any other laws for that matter, it is likely that the public wouldn&#8217;t even know about this initiative had it not been for this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790">scoop</a>. Also, it&#8217;s highly unlikely that this type of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/the-coming-fight-over-who-controls-digital-health-data/">surreptitious health data partnership</a> is an anomaly.</p>
<p>As another example, Google also secretly partnered with Mastercard in an effort to compete with Amazon and capture consumer retail spending data. After an exposé revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/31/google-and-mastercard-reportedly-partner-to-track-offline-purchases/">clandestine partnership</a>, both companies claimed that they didn&#8217;t have any personally identifiable information for any customers. According to Google, they utilized double-blind encryption technology that protected all user data, which had been aggregated and anonymized. Despite this frequently made argument that all the users&#8217; personal data had been &#8220;de-identified,&#8221; at no point were Mastercard or Google users made privy of the deal. In all likelihood, this Mastercard partnership is not a one-off for Google. Through an <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/">AdWords blog</a>, Google claims to have access to 70% of all credit and debit card users&#8217; activity.</p>
<p>The moral of the story? Don’t be like Google.</p>
<h2>Use encryption tools to protect customer data transmitted over public networks</h2>
<p>If your business sends user data over public networks, ensure all server connections use encryption with strong ciphers. Follow the hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) and the transport layer security (TLS) protocols to ensure there is always a secure connection between web browsers, your corporate server and all third-party servers. Not only does the TLS protocol allow both parties to be authenticated, but it also encrypts the data, ensuring that no third parties can eavesdrop or otherwise interfere with the data transfer process.</p>
<h2>Consider investing in internal data centers</h2>
<p>If economically feasible, companies should store customer data in self-owned data centers, or own the servers inside these data centers. By not relying on third-party data centers and public cloud offerings, not only will you bolster your data privacy initiatives, but you&#8217;ll also likely save money over time. Additionally, your company will benefit as more and more users begin to value companies that go out of their way to protect user data.</p>
<p>As a private company, ManageEngine has never been beholden to external shareholders, which has allowed executives to look at things through a philosophical lens as opposed to a financial lens. From the outset, they&#8217;ve always placed a premium on user privacy, which is why the current surveillance landscape has garnered such ire within their organization. To be sure, they&#8217;ve left some money on the table by taking such a hard line on privacy.</p>
<p>However, as Vegesna frequently asks, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of being financially profitable if your business is morally bankrupt?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, some of the biggest stories on TechCrunch have come from you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/google-employees-demand-company-stop-selling-tech-to-police/">internal employee battles</a> at some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies, reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/t-mobile-layoffs-sprint/">unexpected layoffs</a> during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/bird-lays-off-about-30-of-workforce-amid-covid-19-pandemic/">the pandemic</a>, uncovered safety violations, seen how Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">paid teens to snoop</a> on their private data, revealed a major hack that a company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/03/stockx-hacked-millions-records/">tried to cover up</a>, and exposed workplace discrimination, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/">secretive startups</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/">government wrongdoing</a>.</p>
<p>We have been able to report on these important issues in large part because sources have reached out with information that companies and governments don&#8217;t want to come to light.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re making it easier and more secure for you to contact TechCrunch reporters and editors.</p>
<p>Today, we are launching our own SecureDrop, a tip submission system that allows you to securely and anonymously reach out with information, files and documents for us to investigate.</p>

<p>SecureDrop is a system designed to allow us to communicate with you while protecting your identity from virtually all kinds of tracking. It works in part thanks to the Tor anonymity network, which bounces and encrypts your internet traffic through several servers on its way to its destination in order to make tracking almost impossible. Accessing Tor — and our SecureDrop — requires use of the free-to-use Tor Browser. That means we won&#8217;t know who you are, unless you tell us.</p>
<p>We know what sources risk in revealing information that the powerful want to keep secret.</p>
<p>Rest assured, our SecureDrop is physically controlled by TechCrunch, and anything you submit to SecureDrop is encrypted and can only be viewed by TechCrunch editors. The software itself, maintained by the nonprofit <a href="https://securedrop.org/directory/techcrunch">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, goes through regular security audits and will be kept up-to-date with the latest fixes.</p>
<p>You can access instructions on how to use our SecureDrop by going to: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/securedrop"><strong>techcrunch.com/securedrop</strong></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a>, a company I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">first wrote about back in February</a>, has spent the months since growing rapidly — both in terms of feature set and user base. This morning the company is announcing it has raised a $4 million seed round.</p>
<p>Originally focused on being a platform for safely reselling FunkoPop vinyl figurines, Whatnot has since expanded into other types of collectables, including Pokémon cards, sports cards and FiGPiNs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3fjS1ZzGgS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/embed/#?secret=3fjS1ZzGgS" data-secret="3fjS1ZzGgS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has also expanded beyond simple buying/selling mechanics, embracing a trend that was already proving popular before the pandemic struck and has only grown since: livestreamed video sales and auctions.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never fallen down the rabbit hole that is collecting, perhaps you haven&#8217;t seen this kind of sale — but once you&#8217;ve tuned in, it&#8217;s hard to stop. Popular amongst groups like Disney pin traders, live video auctions are … well, they&#8217;re exactly what they sound like. The host fires up a livestream, a notification going out to their fanbase of fellow collectors that it&#8217;s time for a sale. Their phone camera pointed at the item up for grabs (often spinning in place on a turntable to give a full view of its condition), the host&#8217;s job is part auctioneer, part hype man. They&#8217;ve got to know the ins and outs of the item in question, interact with folks in chat, and generally just keep the energy high so that viewers stick around.</p>
<p>A lot of these auctions happen on platforms like Instagram, which … aren&#8217;t really built for this. Selling an item there means manually connecting with buyers after the fact, figuring out payments and hoping no one backs out. Whatnot wants to specialize in it and has spent the last few months building out livestreaming tools accordingly. Streams are handled directly through their mobile app, as is all the payment and processing on the seller&#8217;s end. I popped into a few random streams last night, and they each had dozens to hundreds of people watching and bidding on items like Mumm-Ra Funko Pops, with users trying to guess what might show up in the stream next.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088789" style="width: 1459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088789" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2088789 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg" alt="" width="1449" height="902" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg 1449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1449px) 100vw, 1449px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whatnot</p></div></p>
<p>Another increasingly popular livestreaming concept for Whatnot is that of the &#8220;card break.&#8221; Users pool their money to buy an entire box of trading card packs — often boxes that are no longer being produced and can cost thousands of dollars to obtain. Each user gets a number, each number tied to a pack (or packs) within the box. Each pack is opened on the livestream, its contents sent to the (hopefully?) lucky owner tied to that pack&#8217;s number.</p>
<p>Whatnot co-founder Logan Head calls the company&#8217;s growth in recent months &#8220;explosive,&#8221; telling me that additions like livestreaming have helped them grow &#8220;at least 100% month-over-month&#8221; as of late. The Whatnot team has grown as well. It&#8217;s currently sitting at 12 employees and is actively looking for more engineers — thus the need to raise. The company tells me that this $4 million seed round was backed by Scribble Ventures, Operator Partners, Wonder Ventures, Y Combinator and a number of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> head of human spaceflight Kathy Lueders joined us on stage at TechCrunch Sessions: Space, where she spoke to <a href="http://www.thespacegal.com">scientist and Netflix host Emily Calandrelli</a> about her work at the agency — including NASA&#8217;s progress on the Artemis program and the return of American astronauts to the surface of the moon.</p>
<p>The 2024 target for NASA&#8217;s first Artemis moon landing has been oft-repeated by the agency, and by current NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, who has confirmed that his tenure is ending in January once the Biden administration takes over the U.S. presidency. But it&#8217;s also a timeline that has raised many an eyebrow among outside observers, and seems particularly challenging given setbacks resulting from stay-at-home orders and remote-work measures implemented by NASA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we had Commercial Crew, my goal was 2017,&#8221; Lueders said. &#8220;We did not fly in 2017, even though we were working super, super hard to get to 2017. Having that 2017 goal didn&#8217;t mean that I made stupid decisions just to get to 2017 — I still carefully went through and made the decisions. And then we ended up flying in 2020 — in fact we ended up flying [the mission] in 2019, which originally would have been our 2017 goal. People get very fixated on 2024, because it is an important goal for us. But I also know that we&#8217;ll work through this carefully, and we will inform people of our progress along the way, just like we&#8217;ve done for every single other program out there. And we will fly when we&#8217;re ready to fly with the mission capability that we need to fly in a safe and effective manner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lueders also addressed a question about diversity, and racial diversity in the agency, and its importance to the agency. Lueders is the first woman to ever occupy the role of the associate administrator of the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, who leads all human spaceflight activities across the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want people to see themselves in what we&#8217;re doing, because the point of this is it&#8217;s not about NASA doing this anymore,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is about you doing it, and about you being able to do it. I think one of the most striking things that I got was a letter from a nine-year-old girl in India right after I got announced. And she said, &#8216;Because you have your job, I think I can be NASA administrator someday.&#8217; And you saw the diversity in that Artemis crew, and we want people to see themselves out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lueders also talked about the<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-artemis-team-of-astronauts-eligible-for-early-moon-missions"> diversity present in the NASA Artemis astronaut class</a>, which it just announced, and about the potential for who from that pool will be selected to actually crew the first lunar landing for Artemis.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my favorite things is, I&#8217;m still not sure it can&#8217;t be two women,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We need to pick the right people.&#8221;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">On-orbit servicing startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orbit-fab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orbit-fab">Orbit Fab, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which bills itself as the company focused on creating &#8220;gas stations in space,&#8221; has added an additional investor to its seed funding round. The add-on investment comes from Munich Re Ventures (the corporate VC arm of Munich Re Group, one of the largest insurance companies in the world). Munich Re Group is a key provider of insurance for satellite operators in particular, offering policies that cover pre-launch, launch and on-orbit operations.</p>
<p>Orbit Fab, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019, has designed a system that consists of what are essentially in-space tugs that can guide spacecraft on-orbit to refueling depots, to which they connect with the company&#8217;s custom fueling interface. It&#8217;s designed to be relatively easy to incorporate into new satellite designs, providing a way to easily refuel in space without requiring any special robotic systems for capture and docking.</p>
<p>The goal of the startup is to help create a more sustainable orbital commercial operating environment, extending the life of spacecraft, reducing debris and saving companies money. Bringing on Munich Re Ventures should provide it with significant advantages in terms of being able to build more sustainable, long-lived operational spacecraft into launch and operation risk models for satellite operators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we look at standing up a propellant supply chain, so much of it is the financial model,&#8221; Orbit Fab co-founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/daniel-faber" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="daniel-faber">Daniel Faber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview. How do we use this to move our customers&#8217; risk, to make sure that we&#8217;re moving capital expenditure to operational expenditure, and yet not introducing additional risk? [Munich Re] is all over it in terms of financial products and insurance and risk assessment, so that&#8217;s a great partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faber went on to explain that Munich Re Ventures Timur Davis began to show up at more and more space conferences, and Faber began to chat with him at these events. It turned out that the venture firm was putting together an investment thesis around in-space servicing and infrastructure, and Orbit Fab eventually became the first investment on the back of that new thesis.</p>
<p>The new investment brings Orbit Fab&#8217;s total seed raise to $6 million, including between $2 to $3 million in government funding on top of VC funds. The company has also now conceived and researched a &#8220;self-driving satellite&#8221; kit for docking that it has received <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-science-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-science-foundation">National Science Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> funding to do preliminary requirements development, and it&#8217;s now at the point where it can begin designing and building that out. 2021 looks to be a big year for many new companies in the space industry, and Orbit Fab with its new approach to sustainable, scalable satellites operations is definitely among them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">major antitrust effort</a> seeking to dismantle the unprecedented power of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a group of 38 attorneys general announced a bipartisan lawsuit against <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> alleging the company has engaged in &#8220;illegal, anti-competitive conduct&#8221; to create a monopoly in search and search advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s anti-competitive actions have protected its general search monopolies and excluded rivals, depriving consumers of the benefits of competitive choices, forestalling innovation, and undermining new entry or expansion,&#8221; Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said. “This lawsuit seeks to restore competition.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The state of Colorado is co-leading the lawsuit with Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. New York Attorney General Letitia James called Google the &#8220;gatekeeper of the internet&#8221; and slammed the company for leveraging the personal data it collects to solidify its market dominance.</p>
<p>Compared to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Texas-led suit against Google</a> announced yesterday, the second lawsuit represents a broader coalition of 35 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The new lawsuit, embedded below, will run in parallel with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">Justice Department&#8217;s own federal suit</a>, which also alleges that the company has abused its power to create and maintain a monopoly.</p>
<p>In the new lawsuit, the group of states accuses Google of entering into exclusionary agreements, disadvantaging specialized search sites like Expedia and Yelp and favoring its own business with its search engine marketing tools. They describe Google&#8217;s power as self-reinforcing, blaming the company for limiting consumers&#8217; options and in turn feeding it more valuable data on their behavior.</p>
<p>Citing violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the federal antitrust law meant to protect competition, the group of states asks the court to rebalance the advantages that Google enjoys and suggests &#8220;structural divestitures&#8221; as one course of action.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">46-state suit against Facebook</a> we saw last week, U.S. state efforts to challenge Google were split in two. Why are there <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">two separate antitrust lawsuits</a> going after Google over similar complaints? Likely because many state leaders weren&#8217;t eager to sign on to an effort led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who not only led the doomed long-shot effort to overturn election results in four states but is also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ken-paxton-austin-texas-crime-f8413d14842d848e69cf81bb4d2e87e2">currently being investigated by the FBI</a> for bribery.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/redesigning-search-would-harm-consumers-and-american-businesses/">blog post</a>, Google responded to the allegations presented in the new suit, emphasizing the company&#8217;s positive impact on consumers and small businesses.&#8221;&#8230;This lawsuit seeks to redesign Search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses’ ability to connect directly with customers,&#8221; Adam Cohen, Google&#8217;s Director of Economic Policy, wrote. &#8220;We look forward to making that case in court, while remaining focused on delivering a high-quality search experience for our users.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of virtual communications continues to hold a central place in our socially-distanced lives, and today it looks like one of the companies reaping some of the spoils is also reaping some funding out of it. <a href="http://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, the chat and communications platform wildly popular with gamers and, increasingly, many others, has confirmed to us today that it has raised $100 million more in funding as it hits 140 million monthly active users, double the number it had a year ago.</p>
<p>“We are humbled and honored by the growth we’ve seen among so many incredible and diverse communities that have made Discord their place to hang out,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Jason Citron in a statement. &#8220;As we look to 2021, we are excited about what we have in store and plan to use this funding to help make Discord even better &#8211; both for our free service and our <a href="https://discord.com/nitro" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.com/nitro&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608323767203000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8y28UNMK7cpgOyRnj5JgeY58wrg">Nitro</a> subscribers.”</p>
<p>Greenoaks Capital is leading this round, and we&#8217;ve confirmed with sources that Index Ventures is also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Discord is the best place to gather with your communities, whether to play video games, swap recipes, or collaborate on a project,&#8221; said Neil Mehta, founder and managing partner at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We believe Discord will evolve and grow alongside the endless innovation in the ways people interact, ultimately connecting billions of people around the world. We are lucky to continue our long-term partnership with Jason, Stan and the entire Discord team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported that the company was in the process of raising up to $140 million in a Series H round, at a valuation that could be as high as $7 billion, according to paperwork filed by the company and unearthed by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/discord-secures-140m-doubles-valuation-to-7b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Unicorn Index</a>.</p>
<p>We have attached the documentation at the end of this article. Given the discrepancy between how much it&#8217;s announcing today, and how much it&#8217;s filed to raise, we have asked to see if the round is still open.</p>
<p>The analysts&#8217; report appears to confirm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/discord-is-close-to-closing-a-round-that-would-value-the-company-at-up-to-7b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own reporting</a> from some weeks ago. At the end of November, sources had confirmed to us that the company was raising at a valuation of up to $7 billion.</p>
<p>This latest fundraising had been rumored for a while, and some have described it as a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/genuinfo/status/1328856563205828608?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-IPO round</a>&#8221; for the privately-backed startup. Prime Unicorn notes that Discord&#8217;s most recent price per share in the documentation is $280.2487, with the Series G priced at $144.1809.</p>
<p>Previous investors in the company have included Greylock, IVP, Spark Capital, Tencent and Benchmark, among others. With an extra $140 million, the total amount raised by the startup would stand at $420 million.</p>
<p>The fundraise, and the size of it, is a testament not just to how virtual communications tools continue to be an important part of our lives these days; but to the growth of Discord itself.</p>
<p>Discord made its name originally as a communications channel that could exist in an easy way alongside popular online games &#8212; a byproduct, perhaps, of how it first came into existence. Discord was started by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy as part of their Hammer &amp; Chisel gaming studio as a way for them and their teams to communicate tactics and other details to each other while playing games (their own games, other people&#8217;s games, all games).</p>
<p>It proceeded to get lots of traction on Twitch and with e-sports players, environments where it might be especially interesting for both players and spectators to have a place to provide running commentary on what is going on.</p>
<p>But just as the biggest games and gameplay has mass-market, even casual, appeal, so can the platforms that gamers use to communicate. Discord&#8217;s growth has exploded in recent years, with m<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">onthly active users almost doubling to 120 million this year with 800,000 downloads a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s in part down to Discord&#8217;s use alongside newly, virally popular games like </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/style/among-us.html">Among Us</a>; but also because it&#8217;s being used for more than just games.</p>
<p>The company had already raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million on a $3.5 billion valuation</a> earlier this year, and at the time Citron and Vishnevskiy noted that the platform had already outgrown &#8212; or at least made room for much more than &#8212; its gaming roots:</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“It turns out that, for a lot of you, it wasn’t just about video games anymore,” they<a href="https://blog.discord.com/your-place-to-talk-a7ffa19b901b"> noted</a>, describing Discord as “a place designed to hang out and talk in the comfort of your own communities and friends&#8230; a place to have genuine conversations and spend quality time with people, whether catching up, learning something or sharing ideas.”</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">That growth among &#8220;communities&#8221; hasn&#8217;t been without its teething pains. Discord has had a high profile, ongoing battle with unsavory elements like white supremacism on its platform. The company claims that this is on the wane, and that the platform is also a home for Black Lives Matter organizers, less politicised social media influencers, and more. Some are not so convinced, so perhaps it&#8217;s a problem that not a finished story and will continue to need to be tackled, much as it is on any social platform.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">“Discord is always on and always present among these groups on the far-right,” Joan Donovan, the lead researcher on media manipulation at the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, told <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/discord-safe-space-white-supremacists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> some years ago. “It’s the place where they do most of the organizing of doxing and harassment campaigns.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that this latest $140 million of funding &#8212; that is if it closes &#8212; is coming so swiftly on the heels of the last round, just six months later. The company and its investors have some clear ambitions to build out not just more, better and efficient  tools for gamers, but for people online at large, and that&#8217;s not cheap.</p>
<p>Some of that is happening already: witness yesterday&#8217;s news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/discord-will-be-able-to-screen-share-from-ios-and-android-devices-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord&#8217;s screen share functionality getting extended finally beyond desktop to iOS and Android</a> (an interesting area, considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter&#8217;s recent acquisition of Squad</a>).</p>
<p>“Rather than throwing raw content at you, like Facebook, [Discord] provides a shared experience for you and your friends,&#8221; said Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, which led the $100 million round earlier this year. &#8220;We’ll come to appreciate that Discord does for social conversation what Slack has done for professional conversation.”</p>
<p>Prime Unicorn note that the terms in the Series H include &#8220;a pari passu liquidation preference with all other preferred, and conventional convertible meaning they will not participate with common stock if there are remaining proceeds.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://geneme.eu/">GeneMe</a>, Poland-based biotechnology company with a COVID-19 test, has secured a €5.2 million round of seed funding led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robin-tombs">Robin Tombs</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.yoti.com/">Yoti</a> and previously of Gamesys, and other angel investors.</p>
<p>The startup has developed and patented a universal protein (polymerase) for RT-LAMP testing, which allows the production of highly accurate, rapid, molecular genetic COVID tests. It has three molecular NAAT COVID-19 tests: FRANKD, SAVD and ICED. FRANKD is CE IVD-approved and FDA EUA-applied, and its solution is already utilized in over twenty countries. FRANKD has been identified, through official research made by the Scottish government, as the most accurate, rapid COVID-19 test on the market. The FRANKD solution has already been used by Heathrow Airport, Virgin Atlantic and TV show &#8220;Britain’s Got Talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dawid Nidzworski, CEO of GeneMe said: “We’re interested not only in health issues, but also in genetic predispositions, such as talents, sports abilities, learning problems, or caffeine metabolism. In the future, everyone will be able to conduct genetic analysis at home.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robin Tombs, co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yoti">Yoti <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said: “GeneMe’s innovative approach will be highly disruptive over coming years, enabling more regular testing at point of care at much lower cost.”</p>
<p>GeneMe is a spin-out from The Institute of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/biotechnology-4c46" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="biotechnology-4c46">Biotechnology <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Molecular Medicine (IBMM), an independent biomedical research institution.</p>
<p>Recently, the company announced a partnership with U.S.-based BIOLYPH, the world leader in lyophilization services, to scale up FRANKD and SAVD significantly.</p>
<p>GeneMe’s patented technology simplifies the entire testing procedure compared to standard laboratory-based RT-PCR tests. RT-LAMP tests are more effective, which means results can be trusted. GeneMe’s testing technology can also be assembled at point of care, which makes it possible to integrate highly accurate testing stations at places of work and in locations with high throughput, such as international borders.</p>
<p>The global COVID-19 diagnostics market size is estimated at $84.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% from 2021 to 2027 (Grand View Research).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">announced</a> it would soon begin testing a new social experience on its platforms involving audio-only chat rooms, similar to the sometimes <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/on-community-moderation">controversial</a> startup Clubhouse. Today, Twitter Spaces, as the product is now being called, is launching into private beta testing. During this time, the product will be limited to select individuals, largely from underrepresented backgrounds, Twitter says.</p>
<p>As the company had explained in November, it would be critical to getting safety right in order for people to feel comfortable in these sorts of spaces. That&#8217;s a difficult challenge to overcome &#8212; particularly for a company like Twitter, which some have argued has overly favored free speech to limit cries of censorship, even when such speech made some afraid to speak up on the platform&#8217;s potential for abuse, bullying and cancel culture.</p>
<p>Though audio-based social networking is still a relatively new concept, in its current iteration of private mobile-social &#8220;spaces,&#8221; it&#8217;s already been proven difficult to moderate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse, though still in invite-only testing phase, has seen several high-profile incidents of moderation failure, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">the harassment of a New York Times reporter,</a> and another conversation that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">delved into anti-Semitism</a>. And it hasn&#8217;t publicly launched.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s test hopes to discover where issues impacting user safety and comfort can be addressed.</p>
<p>The test will run on iOS during the beta, offering the opportunity for users to participate in host-moderated audio conversations between two or more people.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079726" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079726" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2079726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg 1832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=768,535 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1070 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-1.00.14-PM.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>There are two ways to create a Space, Twitter says. You can either press and hold the compose button in the lower right corner of the screen, or you can create a Space through the Fleet creation screen by swiping right.</p>
<p>Hosts on Spaces will also be able to invite people to join a Space through DMs, by tweeting links, or by sharing a link elsewhere. As the test rolls out, everyone can see and join Spaces when they&#8217;re invited to do so, but hosts will control who&#8217;s speaking. Soon, hosts will also have more options to control conversations.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The test additionally adds new reaction emojis — the 100, raised hand, fist, peace sign and wave &#8212; along with reporting and blocking tools, a &#8220;very early version&#8221; of automatic transcriptions, and the ability to share tweets into a Space. Many of these features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/twitters-audio-spaces-test-includes-transcriptions-speaker-controls-and-reporting-features/">were already spotted last month</a> by eagle-eyed reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong.</a> But today, Twitter is confirming they will be part of the beta test at launch.</p>
<p>The company will also tweet about Spaces from a dedicated Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterspaces">@TwitterSpaces</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter says the beta test will involved around a couple hundred people and will roll out over the course of the coming weeks on iOS.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic is surging in America once more. If this past year is any indication, it will hurt all of us — but communities of color will continue to suffer disproportionately.</p>
<p>Black and brown folks will make up more of the sick and the dying, and Black and brown businesses and employees will make up more of the people struggling financially.</p>
<p>Here is the good news: Interest in finding common ground and concrete solutions is also surging. That means there are some paths out of the mess we are in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			America’s biggest, best-funded, most-profitable companies are struggling to hire and retain diverse talent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Let’s take stock: The longer the pandemic lasts, the more it could accelerate ongoing trends. Automation and advanced computing was changing how we work and undermining livelihoods before COVID-19, but by 2030, technology and automation will negatively affect hundreds of thousands of jobs that exist today.</p>
<p>The situation is worse for communities of color. Because people of color are overrepresented in fields that are likely to be automated, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-black-america">a McKinsey report</a> estimated that 23.1% of African Americans and 25.1% of Hispanic Americans will see their jobs disappear or transform in the next decade. Even before COVID-19, the situation was bleak.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shift will create new, high-tech jobs, or those same people can retrain, retool and find employment in the economy of the future?</p>
<p>In practice, it is not nearly so easy. In 2019, the average cost for online coding bootcamps was $14,623 per person. Even with loans, installment plans or income-sharing agreements, that is far beyond the reach of many of the people whose current jobs are going away.</p>
<p>The pandemic is making this worse. Nearly 80% of low-income households do not have enough savings to last three months, and a third of Americans will have trouble paying their bills this month.</p>
<p>Waiting for the good news? America’s biggest, best-funded, most-profitable companies are struggling to hire and retain diverse talent. The good news is that they know it. They know they cannot compete without the genius in underrepresented communities, and they know they are not doing well enough right now.</p>
<p>Many companies will spend an average of $20,000 just on recruiting fees for a single IT hire, but hiring an IT candidate from a diverse community can cost three times as much, and once hired, there is a massive retention problem. Since 2016, the retention rate of Black and Latinx employees in Big Tech has fallen from 7% to 5%. There is a revolving door of diverse talent entering and leaving organizations.</p>
<p>In other words, you have a whole bunch of talented, creative people crying out for high-tech jobs — and a whole bunch of powerhouse, innovative companies desperate to hire and hold onto talent and creativity.</p>
<p>These overlapping needs mean we can find common ground. One model for this was the Dream Corps TECH Town Hall this month, where activists and educators from underrepresented communities shared panels with industry leaders. Instead of lobbing bombs at each other, both groups came to talk about the problems they face and how they can work together.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For instance, industry and educational leaders can devote resources to scholarships and training programs that come with job guarantees. Activists and CEOs can both push for universal broadband access, especially in the midst of a pandemic that is damaging learning opportunities for children, so that the next generation of coders has a shot at success.</p>
<p>Untapped talent in underrepresented communities can help companies avoid algorithmic bias and compete in a diverse, global world, and companies can help people thrive as the economy changes.</p>
<p>This common-ground approach is built on the recognition that both sides need each other in order to succeed. It can be a model for other thorny problems and produce necessary solutions. The pandemic is surging once more — but so is the demand for common ground. We can choose how we respond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There’s not a single organization who can claim cybersecurity perfection."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s the nightmare scenario that has worried cybersecurity experts for years.</p>
<p>Since at least March, hackers likely working for Russian intelligence have embedded themselves without detection inside the unclassified networks of several U.S. government agencies and hundreds of companies. Sen. Richard Blumenthal appeared to confirm <a href="https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1339040516881731586?s=21">in a tweet</a> that Russia was to blame, citing a classified congressional briefing.</p>
<p>It began Tuesday with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">news of a breach</a> at cybersecurity giant FireEye, which confirmed it was hacked by a &#8220;sophisticated threat actor&#8221; using a &#8220;novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past.” The hackers, <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html">FireEye said</a>, were primarily interested in information on its government customers, but that they also stole its offensive hacking tools that it uses to stress test its customers&#8217; systems against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Since the hackers had several months of undetected access to several federal agencies, it&#8217;s going to be virtually impossible to know exactly what sensitive government information has been stolen.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach was nothing short of audacious; FireEye has a reputation for being the first company that corporate cyberattack victims will call. But then the news broke that the U.S. Treasury, State, Commerce, the National Institute of Health and Homeland Security — the agency tasked with protecting the government from cyberattacks — had all been infiltrated.</p>
<p>Each of the victims has one thing in common: All are customers of U.S. software firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose network management tools are used across the U.S. government and Fortune 500 companies. FireEye&#8217;s blog <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">explaining the breach</a> — which didn&#8217;t say how it discovered its own intrusion — said the hackers had broken into SolarWinds&#8217; network and planted a backdoor in its Orion software, which helps companies monitor their networks and fleets of devices, and pushed it directly to customer networks with a tainted software update.</p>
<p>SolarWinds said up to 18,000 customers had downloaded the compromised Orion software update, giving the hackers unfettered access to their networks, but that it was unlikely all or even most had been actively infiltrated.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and founder of Rendition Infosec, said hackers would have gone for the targets that got their &#8220;biggest bang for their buck,&#8221; referring to FireEye and government targets. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt in my mind that had the Russians not targeted FireEye we would not know about this,&#8221; Williams said, praising the security giant&#8217;s response to the attacks. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to find more government agencies that were breached. They&#8217;re not detecting it independently. This only got discovered because FireEye got hit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The motives of the hackers aren&#8217;t known, nor do we know yet if any other major private companies or government departments had been hacked.

<p>These kinds of so-called &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/china-spy-hack-chip-bloomberg-supply-chain/">supply chain attacks</a>&#8221; are difficult to defend against and can be near impossible to detect. You might imagine someone sneaking a hardware implant into a device on the manufacturing line. In this case, hackers injected backdoor code in the software&#8217;s development process.</p>
<p>Supply chain attacks are rare but can have devastating consequences. Last year hackers broke into computer maker Asus&#8217; network and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/asus-update-backdoor/">similarly pushed a backdoor</a> to &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of Asus computers through its own software update tool. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/uk-accuses-russia-of-2017s-notpetya-ransomware-attacks/">NotPetya ransomware attack</a> that spread across the globe in 2017 spread by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">pushing malicious</a> code <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">through the update feature</a> in a popular Ukrainian accounting software, used by almost everyone who files taxes in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Allan Jones&#8217;s first startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/01/sciences-triple-thread-brings-personalized-commerce-to-retailers-powers-mens-clothing-site-fourth-and-grand/">Fourth and Grand</a>, a Trunk Club-like service backed by the venture studio and accelerator, Science, out of Santa Monica.</p>
<p>While the business didn&#8217;t work out, it put the budding young entrepreneur (and college dropout) on a path that would lead him to launch the Los Angeles-based startup <a href="https://get.bambee.com/hr/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=sem-br&amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;utm_content=cmp-1754081434%7Cadg-66974496845%7Ccr-341328739390%7Cdev-c%7Ctarget-kwd-295419632816&amp;utm_term=bambee&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA63HyMDe_XF8hm-eFcCKaCRccaxX6NmTEeiZE_CW5toQKDnBnBn-Y1xoCcJkQAvD_BwE">Bambee</a>, a company that lets small businesses give their employees access to the same kinds of human resources services that large companies have.</p>
<p>What sets Bambee apart from companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenefits" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenefits">Zenefits <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and other companies looking to provide human resources services is its focus on the needs of employees as well as employers. Many tools are focused on recruitment, talent management and benefits management from the employer perspective. Bambee bills itself as handling the softer, human side of human resources, rather than the business processes that surround it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones said that the inspiration for the business goes back to watching his own father, who owned a local minimarket in Upland, Calif., deal with a nuisance wrongful termination lawsuit from a disgruntled employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every small business in the country should have access to a human resources professional,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;When I was a kid my dad owned a small minimarket and got sued for wrongful termination and he had to dip into my college education fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of working with LA startups including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/docstoc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="docstoc">Docstoc <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and ZipRecruiter, Jones realized that the precarity he had witnessed in his father&#8217;s situation as an employer carried over to employees as well. &#8220;Vulnerability existed for both sides,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>Observers need look no further than the situations of employees at startups like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wework-857c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wework-857c">WeWork, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Uber, Zenefits, or even Away, to know that a lack of human resources early in a company&#8217;s existence can snowball into larger and larger problems later.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="khkK6Iz62c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns/">Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns/embed/#?secret=khkK6Iz62c" data-secret="khkK6Iz62c" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a pervasive thing across 5.6 million companies,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Once you realize that notion … and that there&#8217;s no solution … We thought that was insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bambee, Jones claims, offers 80% of what a full-time human resources professional can offer at a much smaller fraction of the price.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For $99 a month, Bambee provides its clients with their own dedicated HR manager &#8212; from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">creating and implementing the right HR policies, collecting electronic signatures in its app, and navigating the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complex regulatory world of compliance, the company said. These </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managers can lead </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internal investigations, hires, onboarding, furloughs and implementation of return to work procedures.</span></p>
<p>Human resources professionals can be wellsprings of information beyond simply ensuring that management misbehavior doesn&#8217;t metastasize into a company-wide debacle. They also provide information on how to furlough employees, how to rehire staff and how to account for both situations. In the response to the COVID-19 pandemic that information became critical.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why companies like Stojo Projects, Knife Aid and Hank&#8217;s Bagels all use the company&#8217;s service. Bambee has around 10,000 customers just like them nationwide and has raised $32 million to date. In October, the company closed a $15 million round led by <a href="https://qedinvestors.com/">QED Investors</a> with participation from previous investors including AlphaEdison.</p>
<p>And Jones thinks there&#8217;s lots of room to grow. Once the company has locked in the soft services of actually managing human resources, the more commoditized tools of employee benefits management, salaries and the rest should be easy. Other financial instruments could come off the back end as well, Jones said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of my ambition here is to better equitize the relationship between employee and employer,&#8221; Jone said. &#8220;Start at the basics and better define those relationships. Once we saw how pervasively undefined and disrespected the relationships between employee and employer world. The HR service component where the trust equity is built … how much can you expand what you can get these companies to do?&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid the rise of remote selling due to the pandemic, <a href="http://Walnut.io">Walnut</a>, billing itself as a &#8220;Wix for Sales teams,&#8221; has raised $3.5 million from SV Angel (Ron and Topher Conway) and A.Capital by Ronny Conway and former a16z partners. This brings its total amount raised to $6 million. Other investors include NFX, Joe Montana, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wix">Wix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO, Immad Akhund and Kenny Stone.</p>
<p>Walnut is solving the friction between sales and back-end teams and the problem of sales demos that break during calls. A sales rep logs in to the main dashboard/product they are trying to sell and uses Walnut to choose pages and features that will be disconnected from the back end and appear as front end in Walnut&#8217;s cloud, then edit to match it to the specific client. It&#8217;s like building web pages but for sales pitches.</p>
<p>It’s currently working with enterprise clients like Varonis and Adobe. While it competes with <a href="http://Gong.io">Gong.io</a>, Walnut is hoping that its more technical approach of disconnecting front end and back end will aid its progress.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2018/08/29/cncf-receives-9-million-cloud-credit-grant-from-google/">announced</a> that it would provide $9 million in Google Cloud Platform credits &#8212; divided over three years &#8212; to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to help it run the development and distribution infrastructure for the Kubernetes project. Previously, Google owned and managed those resources for the community. Today, the two organizations announced that Google is adding on to this grant with another $3 million annual donation to the CNCF to &#8220;help ensure the long-term health, quality and stability of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Google notes, the funds will go to the testing and infrastructure of the Kubernetes project, which currently sees over 2,300 monthly pull requests that trigger about 400,000 integration test runs, all of which use about 300,000 core hours on GCP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy that we&#8217;re able to continue to make this investment,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/aparna-sinha" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="aparna-sinha">Aparna Sinha, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a director of product management at Google and the chairperson of the CNCF governing board, told me. &#8220;We know that it is extremely important for the long-term health, quality and stability of Kubernetes and its ecosystem and we&#8217;re delighted to be partnering with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation on an ongoing basis. At the end of the day, the real goal of this is to make sure that developers can develop freely and that Kubernetes, which is of course so important to everyone, continues to be an excellent, solid, stable standard for doing that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sinha also noted that Google contributes a lot of code to the project, with 128,000 code contributions in the last twelve months alone. But on top of these technical contributions, the team is also making in-kind contributions through community engagement and mentoring, for example, in addition to the kind of financial contributions the company is announcing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kubernetes project has been growing so fast &#8212; the releases are just one after the other,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/priyanka-sharma-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="priyanka-sharma-2">Priyanka Sharma, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/priyanka-sharma-takes-over-the-leadership-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/">General Manager of the CNCF</a>. &#8220;And there are big changes, all of this has to run somewhere. [ … ] This specific contribution of the $3 million, that&#8217;s where that comes in. So the Kubernetes project can be stress-free, [knowing] they have enough credits to actually run for a full year. And that security is critical because you don&#8217;t want Kubernetes to be wondering where will this run next month. This gives the developers and the contributors to the project the confidence to focus on feature sets, to build better, to make Kubernetes ever-evolving.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while both Google and the CNCF are putting their best foot forward here, there have been some questions around Google&#8217;s management around the Istio service mesh project, which was incubated by Google and IBM a few years ago. At some point in 2017, there was a proposal to bring it under the CNCF umbrella, but that never happened. This year, Istio became one of the founding projects of Open Usage Commons, though that group is mostly concerned with trademarks, not with project governance. And while all of this may seem like a lot of inside baseball &#8212; and it is &#8212; it had some members of the open-source community question <a href="https://thenewstack.io/googles-management-of-the-istio-service-mesh-raises-questions-in-the-cloud-native-community/">Google&#8217;s commitment to organizations like the CNCF</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google contributes to a lot of open-source projects. [ … ] There&#8217;s a lot of them, many are with open-source foundations under the Linux Foundation, many of them are otherwise,&#8221; Sinha said when I asked her about this. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new, or anything to report about anything else. In particular, this discussion &#8212; and our focus very much with the CNCF here is on Kubernetes, which I think &#8212; out of everything that we do &#8212; is by far the biggest contribution or biggest amount of time and biggest amount of commitment relative to anything else.&#8221;</p>

That&#8217;s one less cookie banner you&#8217;ll have to click away to get your work done.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one likes cookie banners,&#8221; GitHub CEO Nat Friedman writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;But cookie banners are everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason for that, of course, is because of regulations like GDPR in the U.S. and the EU&#8217;s directive to give users the right to refuse the use of cookies that reduce their online privacy. The result, even though these regulations have the users&#8217; best interest in mind, is the constant barrage of cookie banners you experience today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At <span class="il">GitHub</span>, we want to protect developer privacy, and we find cookie banners irritating, so we decided to look for a solution. After a brief search, we found one: just don’t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really,&#8221; Friedman writes.</p>
<p>To be fair, for a service like GitHub, it may be a bit easier to do away with cookies than for most sites &#8212; and especially content sites (and yes, I&#8217;m well aware that you probably had to click away from a cookie popup when you came to TechCrunch, too. Feel free to tell me about the irony of that in the comments). GitHub, after all, has a paid product and an audience that likely uses extensions to block trackers and unnecessary cookies anyway. Because of this, the tracking data it gathered was probably not all that useful anyway. GitHub is one of the first large sites to make this move, though, and may be able to set a bit of a trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, day one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/#tickets">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, was (brace yourself) out of this world. Bad puns aside, today’s lineup promises even more in-depth interviews, Q&amp;As and breakout sessions with the top experts in the space industry. It also includes a pitch-off and plenty of networking opportunities to connect with the leading movers and shakers across public, private and defense sectors.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a more complex or expensive industry, and you’ll need all the tips, insight, guidance — and funding — you can get to successfully launch your space startup. Here’s a quick look at just some of day two’s presentations and opportunities designed to help you build a successful business. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/#2f65e915-5963-4a04-be6a-667c01da1e6d">the complete event agenda</a> to plan your day.</p>
<p><strong>Timely tip:</strong> The agenda automatically reflects the time zone in which you’re currently located.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Fast Money — Advancing Space Technology with NASA SBIR:</strong> Learn about the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs powered by NASA. Jenn Gustetic (NASA) and Lydia Etters (The Aerospace Corporation)</p>
<p><strong>Starburst x TechCrunch — Pitch Me to the Moon:</strong> In which 10 promising early-stage space startups pitch their innovations live to a panel of high-profile judges from across the industry (including reps from Starburst and TechCrunch).</p>
<p><strong>From Idea to Orbit:</strong> Rocket Lab has quickly become one of the most sought-after launch providers in the world. Founder and CEO Peter Beck will discuss the company’s approach to making space more accessible, from cheaper, faster launches to its new satellite platform.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging Today and Tomorrow&#8217;s Tech:</strong> Corporate VC funds are a key source of investment for space startups, in part because they often involve partnerships that help generate revenue as well, and because they understand the timelines involved. We’ll talk about how they fit in with more standard venture to power the ecosystem. Don’t forget to submit your questions for the panel! Meagan Crawford (SpaceFund) and J. Christopher Moran (Lockheed Martin Ventures).</p>
<p><strong>University Showcase — Boldly Innovating in Space, for Space (Part Two):</strong> Part one was fascinating, and you don’t want to miss part two of this university research showcase. You’ll hear scientists and academics from USC, MIT, UCLA, ASU and Caltech — all in partnership with The Aerospace Corporation — share insights on their space research and highlight a range of emerging space technologies. Learn how those technologies are evaluated and integrated into government missions with NASA, NOAA and the Air Force.
