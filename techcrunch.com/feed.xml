										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Traditional MBA programs can be costly, lengthy, and often lack the application of real world skills. Meanwhile,  big global brands and companies who need Product Managers to grow their businesses can’t sit around waiting for people to graduate. And the EdTech space hasn’t traditionally catered for this sector.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why <a href="https://productschool.com/">Product School</a>, says it has secured $25 million in growth equity investment from growth fund <a href="https://www.leedsilluminate.com/">Leeds Illuminate</a> (subject to regulatory approval) to accelerate its product and partnerships with client companies.</p>
<p>The growth funding for the company comes after bootstrapping since 2014, in large part because product managers (PMs) no longer just inside tech companies but have become sought after across almost virtually all industries.</p>
<p>Product School provides certificates for individuals as well as team training, and says it has experienced and upwelling of business since Covid switched so many companies into Digital ones. It also now counts Google, Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, PayPal, Uber, and Amazon amongst its customers.</p>
<p>“Product managers have an outsized role in driving digital transformation and innovation across all sectors,” said Susan Cates, Managing Partner of Leeds Illuminate. “Having built the largest community of PM’s in the world validates Product School’s certification as the industry standard for the market and positions the company at the forefront of upskilling top-notch talent for global organizations.”</p>
<p>Carlos Gonzalez de Villaumbrosia, CEO and Founder of Product School, who started the company after moving from Spain, said: “There has never been a better time in history to build digital products and Product School is excited to unlock value for product teams across the globe to help define the future. Our company was founded on the basis that traditional degrees and MBA programs simply don’t equip PMs with the real-world skills they require on the job.”</p>
<p>Product school has also produced the <a href="https://productschool.com/the-product-book/">The Product Book</a>, <a href="https://productschool.com/proddys/">The Proddy Awards</a> and <a href="https://productschool.com/productcon/">ProductCon</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s main competitor is <a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/">MindTheProduct</a> community and training platform, which has also boostrapped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato’s losses more than tripled in its first quarterly earnings report since its listing last month as the company&#8217;s expenses grew and the pandemic hit the firm&#8217;s dining-out business.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/47aa2394-0e3a-415d-ac77-ce10d2b7f1de.pdf">reported</a> (PDF) a net loss of $48 million in the quarter that ended in June, up from about $13.5 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old firm also reported strong revenue growth, moving from $35.7 million to $113.4 million during the aforementioned period as more people in the country began to order food online.</p>
<p>The firm said it delivered more than 100 million food orders last quarter and has surpassed a billion orders in the past six years.</p>
<p>“This is largely on account of non-cash ESOP expenses which have increased meaningfully in Q1 FY22 due to significant ESOP grants made in the quarter pursuant to creation of a new ESOP 2021 scheme. This divergence in reported profit/loss and Adjusted EBITDA will continue going forward,” a blog post signed by top Zomato executives read.</p>
<p>The executive said in the post that the second wave of the coronavirus, which hit the country beginning in April, &#8220;significantly impacted the dining-out business in Q1 FY22 reversing most of the gains the industry made in Q4 FY21.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188220" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188220" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188220 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="339" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188220" class="wp-caption-text">Zomato&#8217;s shares on BSE.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shares of Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">had a stellar debut on the Indian stock exchanges last month</a>, fell 4% on Tuesday ahead of the results and ended at slightly below the original issue price of $1.68 a share on July 23, which valued Zomato then at $13 billion.</p>
<p>The company said it will hold one call with analysts a year &#8212; instead of the typical four &#8212; and address questions through blogs and quarterly shareholder letters.</p>
<p>In India, Zomato competes with Swiggy, which is backed by SoftBank and Prosus. Last month, the Indian food delivery startup said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">raised $1.25 billion in a new financing round</a>. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 evaluated Zomato before making its bet on Swiggy, people familiar with the dealflow said.</p>
<p>Both the firms in recent quarters have expanded to new categories including grocery delivery.</p>
<p>Zomato is the first Indian consumer internet startup in the current wave to go public. India&#8217;s financial services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">Paytm</a> and MobiKwik as well as online insurer PolicyBazaar and online beauty products firm Nykaa have filed the paperworks to go public later this year.</p>

		<div class="byline__author">
							<span class="byline__author-name">Ben Ofiri</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>
		</div>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Ben Ofiri is the co-founder and CEO of the Kubernetes troubleshooting platform <a href="https://komodor.com/">Komodor</a>. He previously worked at Google, where he served as product lead for the company’s flagship conversational AI project, Google Duplex.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I worked at Google for six years. Internally, you have no choice — you must use Kubernetes if you are deploying microservices and containers (it’s actually not called Kubernetes inside of Google; it’s called Borg). But what was once solely an internal project at Google has since been open-sourced and has become one of the most talked about technologies in software development and operations.</p>
<p>For good reason. One person with a laptop can now accomplish what used to take a large team of engineers. At times, Kubernetes can feel like a superpower, but with all of the benefits of scalability and agility comes immense complexity. The truth is, very few software developers truly understand how Kubernetes works under the hood.</p>
<p>I like to use the analogy of a watch. From the user&#8217;s perspective, it’s very straightforward until it breaks. To actually fix a broken watch requires expertise most people simply do not have — and I promise you, Kubernetes is much more complex than your watch.</p>
<p>How are most teams solving this problem? The truth is, many of them aren’t. They often adopt Kubernetes as part of their digital transformation only to find out it’s much more complex than they expected. Then they have to hire more engineers and experts to manage it, which in a way defeats its purpose.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Where you see containers, you see Kubernetes to help with orchestration. According to Datadog’s most recent report about container adoption, nearly 90% of all containers are orchestrated.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All of this means there is a great opportunity for DevOps startups to come in and address the different pain points within the Kubernetes ecosystem. This technology isn’t going anywhere, so any platform or tooling that helps make it more secure, simple to use and easy to troubleshoot will be well appreciated by the software development community.</p>
<p>In that sense, there’s never been a better time for VCs to invest in this ecosystem. It’s my belief that Kubernetes is becoming the new Linux: 96.4% of the top million web servers&#8217; operating systems are Linux. Similarly, Kubernetes is trending to become the de facto operating system for modern, cloud-native applications. It is already the most popular open-source project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), with 91% of respondents using it — a steady increase from 78% in 2019 and 58% in 2018.</p>
<p>While the technology is proven and adoption is skyrocketing, there are still some fundamental challenges that will undoubtedly be solved by third-party solutions. Let’s go deeper and look at five reasons why we’ll see a surge of startups in this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Containers are the go-to method for building modern apps</h2>
<p>Docker revolutionized how developers build and ship applications. Container technology has made it easier to move applications and workloads between clouds. It also provides as much resource isolation as a traditional hypervisor, but with considerable opportunities to improve agility, efficiency and speed.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter temporarily suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Tuesday after the Georgia Republican posted a tweet that claimed vaccines don&#8217;t reduce the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;These vaccines are failing &amp; do not reduce the spread of the virus &amp; neither do masks,&#8221; Greene tweeted, contradicting the scientific community and calling for the FDA to refuse to approve vaccines. Greene&#8217;s tweet remains up on her Twitter feed, but it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1366508952377192448">paired with a misinformation warning</a> from the company that points users to information from the CDC.</p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch the tweet was &#8220;labeled in line with [Twitter&#8217;s] COVID-19 misleading information policy&#8221; and will result in Greene&#8217;s account being frozen in read-only mode for seven days in light of &#8220;repeated violations&#8221; of Twitter&#8217;s platform rules. Last month, Greene was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter.html">suspended for 12 hours</a> for falsely claiming that the virus posed little threat to healthy people under the age of 65.</p>
<p>The new suspension is Greene&#8217;s fourth slap on the wrist from Twitter under its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/twitter-vaccine-misinformation-labels-strike-system/"> current strike-based system for Covid-19-related misinformation</a>. Greene is a repeat rule-breaker on the platform, which puts her account in jeopardy of a permanent ban if she offends a fifth time after her account is reinstated.</p>
<p>In spite of a widely available trio of vaccines proven to dramatically and effectively reduce the severity of Covid-19 infections or prevent them outright, Covid cases are on the rise in the U.S. in a major way. Florida continues to<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-breaks-record-new-daily-covid-cases-third-time-week-n1276263"> break its own record for daily infections</a>, topping the numbers the state saw during the pre-vaccine months of 2020.</p>
<p>Online misinformation continues to play a major role in discouraging Americans from seeking the vaccine, even with the highly contagious delta variant on the rise. In states like Alabama, where vaccination rates are <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/07/covid-vaccinations-trending-up-in-alabama.html">some of the lowest in the nation</a>, those numbers have begun trending up as residents realize how vulnerable they are to the new variant, which is ravaging pockets of the population that haven&#8217;t yet sought the shot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenAI has already made some big changes to Codex, the AI-powered coding assistant the company announced last month. The system now accepts commands in plain English and outputs live, working code, letting someone build a game or web app without so much as naming a variable. A few lucky coders (and, one assumes, non-coders) will be able to kick the tires on this new Codex API in a free private beta.</p>
<p>Codex is best thought of as OpenAI&#8217;s versatile language engine, GPT-3, but trained only on code instead of ordinary written material. That lets it do things like complete lines of code or entire sections, but when it was announced it wasn&#8217;t really something a non-coder would be able to easily interact with.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s changed with this new API, which interprets ordinary, everyday requests like &#8220;make the ball bounce off the sides of the screen&#8221; or &#8220;download that data using the public API and sort it by date&#8221; and puts out working code in one of a dozen languages.</p>
<p>I was treated to a live demo in which OpenAI co-founders Greg Brockman (CTO) and Wojciech Zaremba (Codex lead) built a simple game from scratch and explained what was going on behind the curtain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Programming is about having a vision and dividing it into chunks, then actually making code for those pieces,&#8221; Brockman explained. The intention with Codex is to let coders spend more time on the first part than the second. After all, a huge amount of code is duplicating or outright copying what others have done before — it can be creative, of course, but no one is going to exercise their imagination in doing basic things like deploying a web server for testing a bit of code. Brockman did just that with a simple line — &#8220;create a web page that says that&#8221; or some such.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187601" style="width: 935px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/openai-plot.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187601" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2187601" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/openai-plot.gif" alt="OpenAI's Codex AI collects data and turns it into a live graph." width="925" height="519" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2187601" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenAI</p></div></p>
<p>A second later there were a dozen lines of Javascript doing just that in a totally standard way.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the worst part of programming,&#8221; said Brockman. &#8220;I&#8217;ve written this kind of code probably a couple dozen times, and I always forget exactly how it works. I don&#8217;t know these APIs, and I don&#8217;t have to. You can just do the same things easier, with less keystrokes or interactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Codex is trained on basically all the public code on GitHub, among other repositories, it&#8217;s aware of all the standard practices, the 50 or 100 times someone includes a web server, keyboard controls, or object manipulations and animations in their code. And because the natural language side has all of GPT-3&#8217;s usual understanding, it gets when you say &#8220;make it smaller and crop it&#8221; and then &#8220;have its horizontal position controlled by the left and right arrow keys&#8221; you&#8217;re referring to the same &#8220;it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also keeps its own work in mind, several kilobytes worth of coding context for itself — so it knows the naming conventions it must stick to, the existing bounds and requests, and other info that the user&#8217;s input would have implied.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also aware of generalities embedded in the code corpus. For instance, when Brockman told it to &#8220;make the boulder fall from the sky,&#8221; the system didn&#8217;t ask what the &#8220;sky&#8221; is even though it hadn&#8217;t been defined on the largely blank canvas. Not only did it have the boulder fall from the top of the screen, but the falling speed accelerated like an object normally would — because its best guess at what &#8220;falling&#8221; and &#8220;sky&#8221; mean from other uses and context.</p>

<p>&#8220;We think it provides a new way to interact with existing software,&#8221; said Zaremba, who built a limited version of this for his PhD thesis years ago, while they demoed a Codex plug-in for Microsoft Word. Automation exists for many tasks in word processors, of course, but what if you get a weird formatting issue and you want to fix 100 different instances? Type &#8220;make all the text the same size and font, and make double spaces single&#8221; and it&#8217;ll do that, snipping out stray styles and picking the most likely size and font considered to be &#8220;normal.&#8221; Then type &#8220;make all the headings 24-point and bold&#8221; and it zooms through doing that, and so on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that this sort of thing is convenient for many, but crucial to those who lack the ability to do these things due to things like disabilities. If you&#8217;re operating your word processor using voice commands or a joystick, being able to perform complex tasks like the above is extremely helpful. A blind coder, like anyone else, can patch together a standard public test server, but the process of skimming Stack Overflow, grabbing the best snippet, checking the syntax, changing the relevant variables and so on will almost certainly be a longer one.</p>
<p>And for those working within the confines of syntax and conventions handed down from on high, Codex can easily be made to reflect those by exposing the model to the documentation. Codex can also convert and port code from one language to another — much the same way a translation engine turns Spanish into French.</p>
<p>Brockman said that, as with GPT-3, they are only scratching the surface of what&#8217;s possible and are hoping to be surprised by what developers come up with (after all, OpenAI didn&#8217;t predict AI Dungeon). The beta will be private, like the one for GPT-3, but devs can apply and describe their project and the Codex team will review them for inclusion. Eventually the API will be a paid public one, but the timing and pricing are still to be determined on that.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars. This Wednesday will be the first nationwide test of the U.S. emergency alert system since the pandemic.</p>
<p>The test will run both the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which broadcasts an emergency tone and message on televisions and radios, and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a newer system that sends emergency notifications to smartphones. It will be the second nationwide test of the WEA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">after its debut in 2018</a>, and the first test for those who have chosen to opt-in to tests.</p>
<p>This time around, the EAS will broadcast the all-too-familiar high-pitched buzz to televisions and radios at around 2:20 p.m. ET. At the same time, the WEA system will broadcast the same tone and message to U.S. cell phones that have opted-in to receive alerts. (You can check your phone settings under <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf">&#8220;Emergency Alerts.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, runs the test every year or two to ensure the system is working properly. It&#8217;s no small task: A national emergency alert system that can broadcast a message to potentially hundreds of millions of people at any given time is fraught with technological hurdles that require close co-operation from the cell carriers and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>The EAS system has been around since the late 1990s, but WEA was developed in the past few years as Americans increasingly moved from televisions and radio and to our phones. WEA alerts, like EAS alerts, are designed to be sent by local and state authorities for public safety alerts, missing children and imminent threats, such as severe weather. More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">FEMA rolled out &#8220;presidential alerts,&#8221;</a> which are supposed to be sent to every phone in the U.S. in the event of a national emergency. Presidential alerts, unlike other alerts, can be issued by the president for any reason, and Americans cannot opt out.</p>
<p>WEA broadcasts emergency notifications through the cell towers of an affected area — such as an area about to be hit by a storm — rather than sending tens of millions of text messages, which would grind the cell networks to a halt. The alerts are created by local, state or federal authorities and are authenticated by FEMA through the Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System, or IPAWS, and then passed to cell carriers to deliver the emergency alert.</p>
<p>Since the last nationwide test, FEMA <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts#enhancements">said it has improved</a> WEA to send longer, detailed messages to the majority of phones that support it, as well as support for sending alerts in Spanish to phones when the default language is set to Spanish. The update also allows authorities to include tappable links, like web addresses.</p>
<p>The emergency alert system, though, is far from perfect. In 2018, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/13/inexcusable-false-ballistic-missile-alert-in-hawaii-was-caused-by-human-error/">erroneous alert</a> sent to Hawaii residents warned of an imminent ballistic missile threat,&#8221; and that &#8220;this is not a drill.&#8221; Minutes later, the alert was canceled. The false warning came as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were at an all-time high, during which Pyongyang was regularly test-firing rockets used for its nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Security experts have also long warned that the EAS systems pose security risks. Last year, researchers found <a href="https://securityledger.com/2020/01/seven-years-later-scores-of-eas-systems-sit-un-patched-vulnerable/">dozens of internet-connected, special-purpose servers</a>, used by television and radio stations to interrupt their broadcasts to relay an emergency alert, which they said could allow a hacker to break in and compromise the servers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is an important goal, but another challenge awaits: lowering the levels of CO2 and other substances already in the atmosphere. One promising approach turns the gas into an ordinary mineral through entirely natural processes; <a href="https://4401.earth/">44.01 hopes to perform this process at scale</a> using vast deposits of precursor materials and a $5M seed round to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>The process of mineralizing CO2 is well known among geologists and climate scientists. A naturally occurring stone called peridotite reacts with the gas and water to produce calcite, another common and harmless mineral. In fact this has occurred at enormous scales throughout history, as witnessed by large streaks of calcite piercing peridotite deposits.</p>
<p>Peridotite is normally found miles below sea level, but on the easternmost tip of the Arabian peninsula, specifically the northern coast of Oman, tectonic action has raised hundreds of square miles of the stuff to the surface.</p>
<p>Talal Hasan was working in Oman&#8217;s sovereign investment arm when he read bout the country&#8217;s coast having the largest &#8220;dead zone&#8221; in the world, a major contributor to which was CO2 emissions being absorbed by the sea and gathering there. Hasan, born into a family of environmentalists, looked into it and found that, amazingly, the problem and the solution were literally right next to each other: the country&#8217;s mountains of peridotite, which theoretically could hold billions of tons of CO2.</p>
<p>Around that time, in fact, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/26/climate/oman-rocks.html">New York Times ran a photo essay</a> about Oman&#8217;s potential miracle mineral, highlighting the research of Peter Kelemen and Jeurg Matter into its potential. As the Times&#8217; Henry Fountain wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>If this natural process, called carbon mineralization, could be harnessed, accelerated and applied inexpensively on a huge scale — admittedly some very big “ifs” — it could help fight climate change.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s broadly speaking the plan proposed by Hasan and, actually, both Kelemen and Matter, who make up the startup&#8217;s &#8220;scientific committee.&#8221; 44.01 (the molecular weight of carbon dioxide, if you were wondering) aims to accomplish mineralization economically and safely with a few novel ideas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First is the basic process of accelerating the natural reaction of the materials. It normally occurs over years as CO2 and water vapor interact with the rock — no energy needs to be applied to make the change, since the reaction actually results in a lower energy state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re speeding it up by injecting a higher CO2 content than you would get in the atmosphere,&#8221; said Hasan. &#8220;We have to drill an engineered borehole that&#8217;s targeted for mineralization and injection.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187465" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2187465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing how carbon can be sequestered as a mineral." width="1024" height="418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png 1029w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png?resize=768,313 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png?resize=680,278 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/44.01-diagram.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2187465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 44.01</p></div></p>
<p>The holes would maximize surface area, and highly carbonated water would be pumped in cyclically until the drilled peridotite is saturated. Importantly, there&#8217;s no catalyst or toxic additive, it&#8217;s just fizzy water, and if some were to leak or escape, it&#8217;s just a puff of CO2, like what you get when you open a bottle of soda.</p>
<p>Second is achieving this without negating the entire endeavor by having giant trucks and heavy machinery pumping out new CO2 as fast as they can pump in the old stuff. To that end Hasan said the company is working hard at the logistics side to create a biodiesel-based supply line (with <a href="https://www.wakud.com/">Wakud</a>) to truck in the raw material and power the machines at night, while solar would offset that fuel cost at night.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot to build up, but Hasan points out that a lot of this is already done by the oil industry, which as you might guess is fairly ubiquitous in the region. &#8220;It&#8217;s similar to how they drill and explore, so there&#8217;s a lot of existing infrastructure for this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but rather than pulling the hydrocarbon out, we&#8217;re pumping it back in.&#8221; Other mineralization efforts have broken ground on the concept, so to speak, such as a basalt-injection scheme up in Iceland, so it isn&#8217;t without precedent.</p>
<p>Third is sourcing the CO2 itself. The atmosphere is full of it, sure, but it&#8217;s not trivial to capture and compress enough to mineralize at industrial scales. So 44.01 is partnering with Climeworks and other carbon capture companies to provide an end point for their CO2 sequestration efforts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As ExxonMobil asks for handouts, startups get to work on carbon capture and sequestration&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/as-exxonmobil-asks-for-handouts-startups-get-to-work-on-carbon-capture-and-sequestration/embed/#?secret=MQZUhiUJXa" data-secret="MQZUhiUJXa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Plenty of companies are working on direct capture of emissions, be they at the point of emission or elsewhere, but once they have a couple million tons of CO2, it&#8217;s not obvious what to do next. &#8220;We want to facilitate carbon capture companies, so we&#8217;re building the CO2 sinks here and operating a plug and play model. They come to our site, plug in, and using power on site, we can start taking it,&#8221; said Hasan.</p>
<p>How it would be paid for is a bit of an open question in the exact particulars, but what&#8217;s clear is a global corporate appetite for carbon offsetting. There&#8217;s a large voluntary market for carbon credits beyond the traditional and rather outdated carbon credits. 44.01 can sell large quantities of verified carbon removal, which is a step up from temporary sequestration or capture — though the financial instruments to do so are still being worked out. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/26/that-night-a-forest-flew-droneseed-is-planting-trees-from-the-air/">DroneSeed</a> is another company offering a service beyond offsets that hopes to take advantage of a new generation of emissions futures and other systems. It&#8217;s an evolving and highly complex overlapping area of international regulations, taxes, and corporate policy.)</p>
<p>For now, however, the goal is simply to prove that the system works as expected at the scales hoped for. The seed money is nowhere near what would be needed to build the operation necessary, just a step in that direction to get the permits, studies, and equipment necessary to properly perform demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to get like minded investors on board, people genuinely doing this for climate change,&#8221; said Hasan. &#8220;It makes things a lot easier on us when we&#8217;re measured on impact rather than financials.&#8221; (No doubt all startups hope for such understanding backers.)</p>
<p>Apollo Projects, a early stage investment fund from Max and Sam Altman, led the round, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures participated. (Not listed in the press release but important to note, Hasan said, were small investments from families in Oman and environmental organizations in Europe.)</p>
<p>Oman may be the starting point, but Hasan hinted that another location would host the first commercial operations. While he declined to be specific, one glance at a map shows that the peridotite deposits spill over the northern border of Oman and into the eastern tip of the UAE, which no doubt is also interested in this budding industry and, of course, has more than enough money to finance it. We&#8217;ll know more once 44.01 completes its pilot work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From vaccine distribution plans to fire trackers to bar crawls for your best friend&#8217;s birthday, maps help people visualize space and express impact. And Felt, a new Oakland-based startup co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samhashemi/">Sam Hashemi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/can">Can Duruk</a>, is on a mission to make the medium more mainstream.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.felt.com/">Felt </a>is a collaborative software company that wants to make it easier for people to build maps on the internet. It announced today that it has raised $4.5 million led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from Designer Fund, Allison Pickens, Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Dylan Field (CEO of Figma) John Lily (former CEO of Firefox), Julia and Kevin Hartz, and Keval Desai.</p>
<p>The millions will be used to help Felt grow its fully distributed six-person team to bring on more front-end, back-end and product engineers, as well as product and brand designers. Along with the financing, the company announced it is launching a private beta to better understand what early adopters it attracts, and how those users engage with the platform.</p>
<p>Felt allows users to build a map with data sets integrated into it. A user can open a map of California, for example, and then turn to Felt’s data library to add information about bits like wildfires and smoke patterns. The map’s power grows as more integrations are used to build out its background; using the prior anecdote, for example, the wildfire map integrated with census data could allow decision makers to see how many businesses could be impacted by incoming smoke.</p>
<p>Over time, Felt users will be able to see other user-generated maps and team projects on the interface &#8212; which they can then copy to add their own flair, or leave comments to support the community.</p>
<p>While consumers will eventually be able to access a free tier, the big test for Felt is if it can find a customer base that is willing to pay, and consistently use mapping software in meaningful ways. The company is in a unique spot. It&#8217;s not a GPS service, so it won&#8217;t serve the consumer who only turns to maps for directions. Instead, its build-a-map service is better suited for companies that already use it in their day-to-day.</p>
<p>Felt is meant to be a continuation of the collaborative software movement underscored by everyday tools like Google Docs and top companies like Notion and Figma, as well as a sequel to Hashemi’s previous company, Remix. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">Recently bought by Via for $100 million</a>, Remix is a city transportation planning startup born out of Code for America Hackathon. As Hashemi spent nearly seven years building Remix, he was introduced to the inadequacies of map-making, namely that there are many use cases for maps but not many people who have the skill set to create a professional product. He hopes Felt will take mapping beyond city planning and into a variety of industries, from education to science to media.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“We really want to be much more aspirational in what we’re trying to accomplish and go much more broader [so it] results in a totally different kind of company,” Hashemi said. Perhaps its biggest competitor is ESRI&#8217;s GIS, a mapping software tool founded in 1969 and still used by hundreds of thousands of companies today.</p>
<p>Climate change could be a catalyst that brings more customers into the collaborative mapping space. Duruk, who built products at Uber and VGS, spoke about the importance of crisis response after last year’s wildfires and the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/slideshow/See-the-Crazy-Orange-Sky-photos-above-San-208457.php">resulting eerie orange sky in the Bay Area.</a></p>
<p>“Everyone in the Bay Area would wake up, go to the air quality map, weather map and the fire map,” Duruk said. “Everyone was trying to do something with maps, but only a few companies in the world had the resources to build something….it was broken.” Felt wants to go broad in its integrations, but did confirm that climate data will be a priority.</p>
<p>The challenge with building a powerful, creative tool is that there is a chance for people to misuse maps for abuse or targeting, Duruk said. Felt is thinking about ways to build in accountability and systematic processes to limit bad actors from using mapping information in the wrong way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, the early-stage startup is focusing on expression as a key way to understand its own product’s bounds. With millions more, Felt is aiming at increasing the capability of people by growing the map-ability of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiwibot, the robotic sidewalk delivery startup, has announced a partnership with food services and facilities management giant Sodexo to bring its robots to U.S. college campuses. As of this month, students and faculty at New Mexico State University, Loyola Marymount University and Gonzaga University should have the option to order fresh meals via cute little robots from Sodexo-serviced locations on campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time Kiwibot is delivering food for over-caffeinated, hungover, exhausted college kids. Its robots, which are designed to look adorable and can move at around two miles per hour, were born at the University of Berkeley, California. There, the company was able to rack up 150,000 deliveries and prove its use case for expansion to other campuses, like the University of Denver and Stanford University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sodexo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides the food for the cafeterias and dining halls of hundreds of colleges across the U.S., so this partnership could prove to be massively fruitful for Kiwibot. It’ll need the boost in order to keep up with its main competition, Starship Technologies, which completed one million delivery rides in January and operates in many college campuses, as well. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former head of Alphabet&#8217;s Loon joins Starship Technologies as new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/former-head-of-alphabets-loon-joins-starship-technologies-as-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=OrX4MhGs44" data-secret="OrX4MhGs44" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campuses are often a natural choice for startups in autonomous development. Not only are universities open to experimenting with new ideas, but given the unit economics on a campus, the revenue growth prospects are more favorable than working B2B in a city, says Diego Varela Prada, chief operating officer at Kiwibot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Additionally, university campuses provide an advantage as they tend to be a more controlled environment than public streets in regards to things such as public infrastructure complexity and car traffic and congestion,” Prada told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the partnership, students will be able to use their meal plans for Kiwibot delivery through their Sodexo Bite+ app. Those without a meal plan can pay a la carte, including $2 flat fee plus 10% of the order amount. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re starting with 10 bots at Loyola, 10 bots at Gonzaga and 30 bots at New Mexico State, and that’s just the beginning,” said Prada. “We’re hoping to have many more. As a B2B business, we’re able to work very closely with our partner to increase the capacity of the bots as demand ramps up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, many college campuses were forced to shut down amid the pandemic. Now, as school is about to be in session again, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/08/09/world/covid-delta-variant-vaccine#cases-in-the-united-states-rise-to-their-highest-levels-since-february"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. is experiencing the highest caseload since February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, averaging about 100,000 new cases everyday. There’s no telling what kinds of shutdowns or lockdowns we’ll see on college campuses this year, but Prada sees Kiwibot providing an avenue for students to order food safely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a procedure to disinfect the bots between orders,” he said. “If you’re a student and you don’t want to mix into large crowds, I think it’s much safer to order food through Kiwibot and have it delivered to the library or your dorm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prada says Kiwibot’s robots, which are in their fourth generation, are advancing to Level 4 autonomy, but are currently at Level 3. The </span><a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society of Automotive Engineers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes both Levels 3 and 4 as a full self-driving system, but with Level 3, a human operator may be required to take over if there’s an issue, whereas a Level 4 system is expected to handle all driving on its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a feature that’s called corner-to-corner, and so what that does is it captures data around an indoor space and feeds that into an algorithm that basically makes decisions for the bot,” said Prada. “It handles the navigation for the robot in between high complexity situations, like cars, people, pets, little kids, people that work on campus. So we are not in a position yet to let the bot go on the campus on its own. Our remote operators have a feature where they switch to corner-to-corner and if the bot senses, for example, a street pass, then the remote operator or supervisor will take over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engineers at Kiwibot are working on getting a bot to navigate indoor-to-outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor, so that it can pick up orders in a kitchen, go outside to deliver it and then navigate inside a building so that it can deliver an order to someone’s room or desk.</span></p>

<div class="embed breakout">

<p>While many of the themes of the report will be familiar to any person not living under (an ever increasingly hot) rock, one part jumped out at me as I was perusing through the documents. The working group assessed that regardless of mitigation and adaptation strategies, many of the negative changes happening to Earth will continue unabated in all future scenarios. From <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">the summary report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level. […] Mountain and polar glaciers are committed to continue melting for decades or centuries (<i>very high confidence</i>). Loss of permafrost carbon following permafrost thaw is irreversible at centennial timescales (<i>high confidence</i>) …</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, there is already momentum toward a warmer and more chaotic world, and we have limited tools to stop many of these trends.</p>
<p>There has been a rush of initiatives, investments, and startups bubbling around the theme of climate tech, with projects focused on everything from improving the yields and decreasing the emissions of agriculture and food production, to improving the power grid, and to reducing the emissions from air conditioning in buildings. Those initiatives are fine and important, but they don’t get at one of the toughest challenges facing us this century: that disasters are here, they are coming, and they are going to continue to get more intense as the century rolls on.</p>
<p>Just this past week, we have seen the second largest fire in California’s state history with the Dixie Fire, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/weather/dixie-wildfire-tuesday/index.html">currently blazing across hundreds of thousands of acres in the northern reaches of the state</a>. Meanwhile in Greece, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/europe/greece-wildfire-warning-climate-intl/index.html">hundreds of wildfires</a> are causing an unprecedented crisis in that country. Droughts, floods, hurricanes, typhoons and more are intensifying and ravaging ever more billions of people across every continent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One response to solving this problem is improving resilience — building up cities and structures as well as food and water systems that are fortified against these natural calamities. Many of those projects though are costly and also time-consuming, measured over the course of decades rather than months.</p>
<p>Instead, we need a more immediate push to develop better disaster response technology today. I’ve covered a wide segment of these companies over the past few months. There’s RapidSOS, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">adding more data into emergency calls</a> to make responses faster and more efficient. There’s Qwake, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/you-can-see-fires-but-now-qwake-wants-firefighters-to-see-through-them/">raised $5.5 million to build hardware and cloud services</a> to allow firefighters to visualize their environments in smoky conditions. Meanwhile, YC-backed Gridware has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/gridware-seed/">raised more than $5 million to create sensors</a> to identify failures in the power grid faster.</p>

<p>In short, there are a growing crop of disaster tech startups — but more are going to be needed to fight the panoply of disasters that will strike in the years ahead.</p>
<p>There’s so much to do: better mental health resources for victims and first responders, easier access to recovery funds to heal lives, higher-quality sensors and data analyses to identify disasters earlier, faster logistics to evacuate people out of harm’s way. In fact, there are quite literally dozens of fields that need more investment and founder attention.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy market, as I pointed out in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">analysis of sales cycles</a>. Budgets are tight, disasters are random, and technology is often an afterthought. In some ways though, that friction is a font of creativity — how to build these next-generation of services and how to sell them is the risk that leads to the potential high return.</p>

<p>As the IPCC’s report made clear this week, the chaotic weather and intense disasters we’ve seen the past few decades aren’t going to abate any time soon. But with ingenuity, we can respond better to the disasters that are already on their way, and save lives and treasure in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> just closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">a $28 billion mega-deal to buy Slack</a>, generating <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Salesforce-Announces-Pricing-of-Aggregate-8-Billion-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx">significant debt along the way</a>, but it’s not through spending big money.</p>
<p>Today the CRM giant announced it was taking <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Announcing-Salesforce-a-New-Streaming-Service-for-Live-Experiences-and-Original-Content-Series/default.aspx">a leap into streaming media with Salesforce+</a>, a forthcoming digital media network with a focus on video that, in the words of the company, “will bring the magic of Dreamforce to viewers across the globe with luminary speakers.” (Whether that’s a good thing or not is in the eye of the beholder.)</p>
<p>Over the last year, Salesforce has watched companies struggle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/once-a-buzzword-digital-transformation-is-reshaping-markets/">to quickly transform into fully-digital entities</a>. The Slack purchase is part of Salesforce’s response to the evolving market, but the company believes it can do even more with an on-demand video service providing business content around the clock.</p>
<p>Salesforce president and CMO Sarah Franklin said in an official post that her company has had to “reimagine how to succeed in the new digital-first world.” The answer apparently is involves getting the larger Salesforce community together is a new live, and recorded video push.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/the-inside-strategy-behind-salesforces-new-streaming-service/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=amer_cbaw&amp;utm_content=AMER%2CEmployee+Tagged%2CEnglish%2CNewsroom">a Q&amp;A with Colin Fleming</a>, Salesforce’s senior vice president of Global Brand Marketing, he sees it as a way to evolve the content the company has been sharing all along. &#8220;As a result of the pandemic, we looked at the media landscape, where people are consuming content, and decided the days of white papers in a business-to-business setting were no longer interesting to people. We’re staring at a cookie-less future. And looking at the consumer world, we reflected on that for Salesforce and asked, “Why shouldn’t we be thinking about this too,&#8221; he said in the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>The company’s efforts are not small. <a href="https://www.axios.com/salesforce-streaming-service-professionals-30a58e49-77fc-469d-9ff7-99f866678a98.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">Axios reports</a> that there are “50 editorial leads” aboard the project to help it launch, and “hundreds of people at Salesforce currently working on Salesforce+” more broadly.</p>
<p>Notably Salesforce does not have near-term monetization plans for Salesforce+. The service will be free, and will not feature external advertising. Salesforce+ will launch in September in conjunction with Dreamforce and include four channels: Primetime for news and announcements, Trailblazer for training content, Customer 360 for success stories and Industry Channels for industry-specific offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company hopes that by combining the announcement with Dreamforce, it will help drive interest in what Salesforce has cooked up. After the Dreamforce push, Salesforce+ will enter into interesting territory. How much do Salesforce customers, and the larger business community really want what the company describes as “compelling live and on-demand content for every role, industry and line of business,” and “engaging stories, thought leadership and expert advice”?</p>

<p>Salesforce is considered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">the most successful SaaS-first company</a> in history, and as such may have an opinion that people are interested in hearing. In its most recent quarterly earnings report in May, the company disclosed $5.96 billion in revenue, up 23% compared to the year-ago quarter, putting it close to a $25 billion run rate. The company also generates lots of cash. But being cash-rich doesn’t absolve the question of whether this new streaming effort will prove to be a money pit, costing buckets of cash to produce with limited returns.</p>
<p>The service sounds a bit like your LinkedIn feed brought to life, but in video form. At the very least, it’s probably the largest content marketing scheme of all time, but can it ever pay for itself either as a business unit or through some other monetization plans (like advertising) down the road?</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM essentials says that he could see Salesforce eyeing advertising revenue with this venture and having it all tie into the Salesforce platform. “A customer could sponsor a show, advertise a show, or possibly collaborate on a show. And have leads generated from the show directly tied to the activity from those options while tracking ROI, and it&#8217;s all done on one platform. And the content lives on with ads living on with them,” Leary told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Whether that&#8217;s the ultimate goal of this venture remains to be seen, but Salesforce has proven that there is market appetite for Dreamforce content at least in the physical world with over a hundred thousand people involved in 2019, the last time the company was able to hold a live event. While the pandemic shifted most traditional conference activity into the digital realm, making Dreamforce and related types of content available year-round in video format makes some sense in that context.</p>
<p>Precisely how the company will justify the sizable addition to its marketing budget will be interesting; measuring ROI from video products is not entirely straightforward when it is not monetized directly. And sooner or later it will have to have some direct or indirect impact on the business or face questions from shareholders on the purpose of the venture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Signal is more important than frequency in an era where we're overloaded with content."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Although he&#8217;s coming from a numbers-driven background, growth expert Julian Shapiro focuses on the emotional power of storytelling these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to think of successful brand-building as creating a company that customers would be upset to separate from their identity,&#8221; he says in an interview below. &#8220;For example, they&#8217;d cease to be the man with Slack stickers all over his laptop. Or the woman who no longer wears Nike shoes every day. And that bugs them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A prolific <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian">Twitter user</a>, writer and now <a href="https://www.brainspodcast.com/">podcaster</a>, he advises startups to &#8220;<a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/storytelling">just blow your own mind</a>&#8221; to best explain the value of what you are offering. Don&#8217;t overthink it. Your own excitement will take your audience on a journey with you in ways that paid acquisition can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s informed by years working with hundreds of startups as the cofounder of Demand Curve (growth training courses) and Bell Curve (a growth agency), but also as a repeat startup founder, angel investor and open-source web developer (<a href="http://velocityjs.org/">Velocity.js</a>).</p>
<p>In the discussion below, he tells us more about the path he&#8217;s taken through the startup world, how companies are changing their public communication and what he&#8217;s most excited about.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187647" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187647" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187647 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?w=645" alt="An illustration of Julian Shapiro" width="645" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png 1548w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=285,300 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=768,810 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=645,680 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=1457,1536 1457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187647" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Julian Shapiro</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What has led you from web development and startups to growth marketing in recent years, and most recently to your own personal writing for the public on Twitter, etc.? Many people in your position would be more comfortable just founding new tech companies, or investing in crypto or what-have-you.</strong></p>
<p>I try to avoid being contained by momentum. If something&#8217;s going well in one field (engineering) but I&#8217;ve found something more fulfilling (like growth strategy), then I&#8217;ll switch. I don&#8217;t switch for the sake of switching, but I will keep switching until I find something I love. That eventually brought me to writing, which I will never stop doing.</p>
<p>Trying a little bit of a lot of things gives you exposure to learn what else you could (and should) be doing. To break out of a local maximum, you need to always remain curious: What else don&#8217;t I know about?</p>
<p>What I ultimately stick with is whatever process I enjoy (not just enjoy the outcome). This usually means the process is fun, educational, adventurous and helps me meet like-minded people. Writing is a bat signal for like-minded people.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re focused on the art of storytelling right now — what are the key things that the startups you work with continue to get wrong here?</strong></p>
<p>The story of a startup is essentially their (1) investor pitch and (2) customer-facing brand.</p>
<p>I like to think of successful brand-building as creating a company that customers would be upset to separate from their identity. For example, they&#8217;d cease to be the man with Slack stickers all over his laptop. Or the woman who no longer wears Nike shoes every day. And that bugs them.</p>
<p>To get to that point, you need a mix of goodwill, what-we-stand-for ideology, social prestige and customer delight—among other affinity-building ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see companies changing the way they talk about themselves to the public in the future, given larger societal trends? Fewer press releases full of canned legalese, more public engagement on social media from the CEO?</strong></p>
<p>Employees with audiences who broadcast corporate messages on a human-to-human level. Plus company social media accounts gaining personality and acting more like their employees.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really hard to grab attention otherwise, especially with the explosion of content creators who are very good at hogging attention and optimizing content for the platforms. Corporate blogs haven&#8217;t been competing with them. I&#8217;m not sure they could. So much of this is personality-driven, to my point in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also hoping, but not expecting, companies to dial back frequency of content production and increase quality of content production. Signal is more important than frequency in an era where we&#8217;re overloaded with content.</p>
<p><strong>Given how many startups you work with across YC, etc., and since you are also an angel investor, what are key industry trends that have you most excited?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in businesses with product-led growth, brand affinity moats and who get harder to compete with the larger they get. In other words, customers do the selling, customers fall in love and defensibility is in their design.</p>
<p>This is in part a reaction to not wanting startups to be so reliant on paid acquisition. And it&#8217;s also a reflection of how I want startups to be thinking more about not just providing transactional value to customers but also making customers truly delighted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today is making a significant change to its returns policy, known as the A-to-Z guarantee, to address issues with defective products sold through Amazon&#8217;s marketplace of third-party sellers. In the past, Amazon directed consumers to the sellers in the case where a defective product caused property damage or personal injury. Now, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/new-a-to-z-guarantee-better-protects-amazon-customers-and-sellers">Amazon says it will directly pay customers</a> for their claims under $1,000, which would cover more than 80% of cases, at no cost to sellers.</p>
<p>It also says it may step in to pay claims for higher amounts if the seller rejects a claim or is unresponsive on a claim Amazon understands to be valid.</p>
<p>For years, Amazon has attempted to skirt responsibility for the products sold through its marketplace, saying it was only the platform that enabled these transactions to take place &#8212; not the liable party in the event of defective product claims. <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/amazon-not-liable-for-defective-third-party-products-texas-high-court-rules/">Some U.S. courts</a> over the years <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/federal-court-determines-amazon-is-not-1782260/">have agreed</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414185/california-appeals-court-amazon-marketplace-responsible-third-party-hoverboard">others have not</a>, complicating matters. Most recently, a California appellate <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/appellate-court-finds-amazon-can-be-held-liable-for-defective-products/">court ruled that Amazon could be sued</a> when consumers were injured by third-party products it sold on its website. The case at hand was a lawsuit over a defective hoverboard a mother bought for her son in 2015, which burned the customer&#8217;s hands and started a fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Amazon&#8217;s marketplace has grown, how defective products and consumer complaints are handled has become even more of problem. Today, Amazon&#8217;s marketplace has 6.3 million total sellers, 1.5 million of which are currently active, according to <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon/number-of-sellers">estimates</a> from Marketplace Pulse.</p>
<p>This situation recently came to a head, when last month Amazon was sued by <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Sues-Amazon-to-Force-Recall-of-Hazardous-Products-Sold-on-Amazon-com">the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>, which aims to force Amazon to accept responsibility for recalling potentially hazardous products sold on Amazon.com. The named products in the complaint included &#8220;24,000 faulty carbon monoxide detectors that fail to alarm, numerous children’s sleepwear garments that are in violation of the flammable fabric safety standard risking burn injuries to children, and nearly 400,000 hair dryers sold without the required immersion protection devices that protect consumers against shock and electrocution,&#8221; the federal agency said.</p>
<p>As a part of that action, the CPSC also wanted Amazon to step in and issue refunds, naming it as a distributor of these products by way of its FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) program. It pointed out that Amazon stores products at its warehouse, inventories them and sorts and ships them &#8212; and earns fees for doing so. The agency also argued that consumers who then buy these products may &#8220;reasonably believe&#8221; they are purchasing from Amazon. (The retailer&#8217;s statement on this <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/2021/07/14/feds-sue-amazon-over-unsafe-products-from-fba-sellers/">can be read here</a>.)</p>
<p>Today, Amazon says it will step in to handle consumer complaints over defective products. Instead of telling customers to reach out to the seller, it will allow customers to begin their claims process through Amazon Customer Service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starting September 1st, Amazon will take the claim information and notify the seller to help them address the claim. If the seller doesn&#8217;t respond, Amazon will step in to address the customer concern at its own cost while it separately tries to pursue the seller. And if the seller rejects a claim that Amazon believes is valid, it will compensate the customer.</p>
<p>The retailer says it will use its existing fraud detection and abuse systems and work with external, independent insurance fraud experts to analyze customers&#8217; claims for validity. This will provide an initial layer of seller protection, as Amazon will stop sellers from having to deal with &#8220;unsubstantiated, frivolous, or abusive claims,&#8221; Amazon explains. It will also offer product liability insurance to sellers through a new service, Amazon Insurance Accelerator, which will offer a selection of trusted providers to shop from.</p>
<p>Amazon likely believes this new policy will help to head off new regulations that could impact how it runs its marketplace business. In announcing the news, Amazon stated that it&#8217;s &#8220;going far beyond our legal obligations and what any other marketplace service provider is doing today to protect customers&#8221; &#8212; a message clearly meant to dissuade further regulation.</p>
<p>The changes will roll out initially in the U.S., Amazon says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Apple announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of new features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeted at child safety on its devices. Though not live yet, the features will arrive later this year for users. Though the goals of these features are universally accepted to be good ones &#8212; the protection of minors and the limit of the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), there have been some questions about the methods Apple is using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Erik Neuenschwander, Head of Privacy at Apple, about the new features launching for its devices. He shared detailed answers to many of the concerns that people have about the features and talked at length to some of the tactical and strategic issues that could come up once this system rolls out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also asked about the rollout of the features, which come closely intertwined but are really completely separate systems that have similar goals. To be specific, Apple is announcing three different things here, some of which are being confused with one another in coverage and in the minds of the public. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/"><b>CSAM detection in iCloud Photos</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A detection system called NeuralHash creates identifiers it can compare with IDs from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other entities to detect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">known CSAM content</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in iCloud Photo libraries. Most cloud providers already scan user libraries for this information &#8212; Apple’s system is different in that it does the matching on device rather than in the cloud.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/"><b>Communication Safety in Messages</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A feature that a parent opts to turn on for a minor on their iCloud Family account. It will alert children when an image they are going to view has been detected to be explicit and it tells them that it will also alert the parent.</span></p>
<p><b>Interventions in Siri and search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A feature that will intervene when a user tries to search for CSAM-related terms through Siri and search and will inform the user of the intervention and offer resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on all of these features you can read our articles linked above or </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s new FAQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it posted this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From personal experience, I know that there are people who don’t understand the difference between those first two systems, or assume that there will be some possibility that they may come under scrutiny for innocent pictures of their own children that may trigger some filter. It’s led to confusion in what is already a complex rollout of announcements. These two systems are completely separate, of course, with CSAM detection looking for precise matches with content that is already known to organizations to be abuse imagery. Communication Safety in Messages takes place entirely on the device and reports nothing externally &#8212; it&#8217;s just there to flag to a child that they are or could be about to be viewing explicit images. This feature is opt-in by the parent and transparent to both parent and child that it is enabled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have also been questions about the on-device hashing of photos to create identifiers that can be compared with the database. Though NeuralHash is a technology that can be used for other kinds of features like faster search in photos, it&#8217;s not currently used for anything else on iPhone aside from CSAM detection. When iCloud Photos is disabled, the feature stops working completely. This offers an opt-out for people but at an admittedly steep cost given the convenience and integration of iCloud Photos with Apple’s operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this interview won’t answer every possible question related to these new features, this is the most extensive on-the-record discussion by Apple’s senior privacy member. It seems clear from Apple’s willingness to provide access and its ongoing FAQ’s and press briefings (there have been at least 3 so far and likely many more to come) that it feels that it has a good solution here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the concerns and resistance, it seems as if it is willing to take as much time as is necessary to convince everyone of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Most other cloud providers have been scanning for CSAM for some time now. Apple has not. Obviously there are no current regulations that say that you must seek it out on your servers, but there is some roiling regulation in the EU and other countries. Is that the impetus for this? Basically, why now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erik Neuenschwander: Why now comes down to the fact that we&#8217;ve now got the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy. This is an area we&#8217;ve been looking at for some time, including current state of the art techniques which mostly involves scanning through entire contents of users libraries on cloud services that &#8212; as you point out &#8212; isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve ever done; to look through user&#8217;s iCloud Photos. This system doesn&#8217;t change that either, it neither looks through data on the device, nor does it look through all photos in iCloud Photos. Instead what it does is gives us a new ability to identify accounts which are starting collections of known CSAM.</span></p>
<p><b>So the development of this new CSAM detection technology is the watershed that makes now the time to launch this. And Apple feels that it can do it in a way that it feels comfortable with and that is ‘good’ for your users?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s exactly right. We have two co-equal goals here. One is to improve child safety on the platform and the second is to preserve user privacy, And what we&#8217;ve been able to do across all three of the features, is bring together technologies that let us deliver on both of those goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Announcing the Communications safety in Messages features and the CSAM detection in iCloud Photos system at the same time seems to have created confusion about their capabilities and goals. Was it a good idea to announce them concurrently? And why were they announced concurrently, if they are separate systems?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, while they are [two] systems they are also of a piece along with our increased interventions that will be coming in Siri and search. As important as it is to identify collections of known CSAM where they are stored in Apple&#8217;s iCloud Photos service, It&#8217;s also important to try to get upstream of that already horrible situation. So CSAM detection means that there&#8217;s already known CSAM that has been through the reporting process, and is being shared widely re-victimizing children on top of the abuse that had to happen to create that material in the first place. for the creator of that material in the first place. And so to do that, I think is an important step, but it is also important to do things to intervene earlier on when people are beginning to enter into this problematic and harmful area, or if there are already abusers trying to groom or to bring children into situations where abuse can take place, and Communication Safety in Messages and our interventions in Siri and search actually strike at those parts of the process. So we&#8217;re really trying to disrupt the cycles that lead to CSAM that then ultimately might get detected by our system.</span></p>

<p><b>Governments and agencies worldwide are constantly pressuring all large organizations that have any sort of end-to-end or even partial encryption enabled for their users. They often lean on CSAM and possible terrorism activities as rationale to argue for backdoors or encryption defeat measures. Is launching the feature and this capability with on-device hash matching an effort to stave off those requests and say, look, we can provide you with the information that you require to track down and prevent CSAM activity &#8212; but without compromising a user’s privacy?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, first, you talked about the device matching so I just want to underscore that the system as designed doesn&#8217;t reveal &#8212; in the way that people might traditionally think of a match &#8212; the result of the match to the device or, even if you consider the vouchers that the device creates, to Apple. Apple is unable to process individual vouchers; instead, all the properties of our system mean that it&#8217;s only once an account has accumulated a collection of vouchers associated with illegal, known CSAM images that we are able to learn anything about the user&#8217;s account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, why to do it is because, as you said, this is something that will provide that detection capability while preserving user privacy. We&#8217;re motivated by the need to do more for child safety across the digital ecosystem, and all three of our features, I think, take very positive steps in that direction. At the same time we&#8217;re going to leave privacy undisturbed for everyone not engaged in the illegal activity.</span></p>
<p><b>Does this, creating a framework to allow scanning and matching of on-device content, create a framework for outside law enforcement to counter with, ‘we can give you a list, we don&#8217;t want to look at all of the user’s data but we can give you a list of content that we&#8217;d like you to match’. And if you can match it with this content you can match it with other content we want to search for. How does it not undermine Apple’s current position of ‘hey, we can&#8217;t decrypt the user&#8217;s device, it&#8217;s encrypted, we don&#8217;t hold the key?’</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t change that one iota. The device is still encrypted, we still don&#8217;t hold the key, and the system is designed to function on on-device data. What we&#8217;ve designed has a device side component &#8212; and it has the device side component by the way, for privacy improvements. The alternative of just processing by going through and trying to evaluate users data on a server is actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amenable to changes [without user knowledge], and less protective of user privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature. I understand that it&#8217;s a complex attribute that a feature of the service has a portion where the voucher is generated on the device, but again, nothing&#8217;s learned about the content on the device. The voucher generation is actually exactly what enables us not to have to begin processing all users&#8217; content on our servers which we&#8217;ve never done for iCloud Photos. It&#8217;s those sorts of systems that I think are more troubling when it comes to the privacy properties &#8212; or how they could be changed without any user insight or knowledge to do things other than what they were designed to do.</span></p>
<p><b>One of the bigger queries about this system is that Apple has said that it will just refuse action if it is asked by a government or other agency to compromise by adding things that are not CSAM to the database to check for them on-device. There are some examples where Apple has had to comply with local law at the highest levels if it wants to operate there, China being an example. So how do we trust that Apple is going to hew to this rejection of interference If pressured or asked by a government to compromise the system?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well first, that is launching only for US, iCloud accounts, and so the hypotheticals seem to bring up generic countries or other countries that aren&#8217;t the US when they speak in that way, and the therefore it seems to be the case that people agree US law doesn&#8217;t offer these kinds of capabilities to our government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even in the case where we&#8217;re talking about some attempt to change the system, it has a number of protections built in that make it not very useful for trying to identify individuals holding specifically objectionable images. The hash list is built into the operating system, we have one global operating system and don&#8217;t have the ability to target updates to individual users and so hash lists will be shared by all users when the system is enabled. And secondly, the system requires the threshold of images to be exceeded so trying to seek out even a single image from a person&#8217;s device or set of people&#8217;s devices won&#8217;t work because the system simply does not provide any knowledge to Apple for single photos stored in our service. And then, thirdly, the system has built into it a stage of manual review where, if an account is flagged with a collection of illegal CSAM material, an Apple team will review that to make sure that it is a correct match of illegal CSAM material prior to making any referral to any external entity. And so the hypothetical requires jumping over a lot of hoops, including having Apple change its internal process to refer material that is not illegal, like known CSAM and that we don&#8217;t believe that there&#8217;s a basis on which people will be able to make that request in the US. And the last point that I would just add is that it does still preserve user choice, if a user does not like this kind of functionality, they can choose not to use iCloud Photos and if iCloud Photos is not enabled no part of the system is functional.</span></p>
<p><b>So if iCloud Photos is disabled, the system does not work, which is the public language </b><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><b>in the FAQ</b></a><b>. I just wanted to ask specifically, when you disable iCloud Photos, does this system continue to create hashes of your photos on device, or is it completely inactive at that point?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If users are not using iCloud Photos, NeuralHash will not run and will not generate any vouchers. CSAM detection is a neural hash being compared against a database of the known CSAM hashes that are part of the operating system image. None of that piece, nor any of the additional parts including the creation of the safety vouchers or the uploading of vouchers to iCloud Photos is functioning if you’re not using iCloud Photos. </span></p>
<p><b>In recent years, Apple has often leaned into the fact that on-device processing preserves user privacy. And in nearly every previous case and I can think of that&#8217;s true. Scanning photos to identify their content and allow me to search them, for instance. I’d rather that be done locally and never sent to a server. However, in this case, it seems like there may actually be a sort of anti-effect in that you&#8217;re scanning locally, but for external use cases, rather than scanning for personal use &#8212; creating a ‘less trust’ scenario in the minds of some users. Add to this that every other cloud provider scans it on their servers and the question becomes why should this implementation being different from most others engender </b><b><i>more</i></b><b> trust in the user rather than </b><b><i>less</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;re raising the bar, compared to the industry standard way to do this. Any sort of server side algorithm that&#8217;s processing all users photos is putting that data at more risk of disclosure and is, by definition, less transparent in terms of what it&#8217;s doing on top of the user&#8217;s library. So, by building this into our operating system, we gain the same properties that the integrity of the operating system provides already across so many other features, the one global operating system that&#8217;s the same for all users who download it and install it, and so it in one property is much more challenging, even how it would be targeted to an individual user. On the server side that&#8217;s actually quite easy &#8212; trivial. To be able to have some of the properties and building it into the device and ensuring it&#8217;s the same for all users with the features enable give a strong privacy property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, you point out how use of on device technology is privacy preserving, and in this case, that&#8217;s a representation that I would make to you, again. That it&#8217;s really the alternative to where users&#8217; libraries have to be processed on a server that is less private.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things that we can say with this system is that it leaves privacy completely undisturbed for every other user who&#8217;s not into this illegal behavior, Apple gain no additional knowledge about any users cloud library. No user&#8217;s iCloud Library has to be processed as a result of this feature. Instead what we&#8217;re able to do is to create these cryptographic safety vouchers. They have mathematical properties that say, Apple will only be able to decrypt the contents or learn anything about the images and users specifically that collect photos that match illegal, known CSAM hashes, and that&#8217;s just not something anyone can say about a cloud processing scanning service, where every single image has to be processed in a clear decrypted form and run by routine to determine who knows what? At that point it&#8217;s very easy to determine anything you want [about a user&#8217;s images] versus our system only what is determined to be those images that match a set of known CSAM hashes that came directly from NCMEC and and other child safety organizations. </span></p>
<p><b>Can this CSAM detection feature stay holistic when the device is physically compromised? Sometimes cryptography gets bypassed locally, somebody has the device in hand &#8212; are there any additional layers there?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s important to underscore how very challenging and expensive and rare this is. It&#8217;s not a practical concern for most users though it&#8217;s one we take very seriously, because the protection of data on the device is paramount for us. And so if we engage in the hypothetical where we say that there has been an attack on someone&#8217;s device: that is such a powerful attack that there are many things that that attacker could attempt to do to that user. There&#8217;s a lot of a user’s data that they could potentially get access to. And the idea that the most valuable thing that an attacker &#8212; who&#8217;s undergone such an extremely difficult action as breaching someone&#8217;s device &#8212; was that they would want to trigger a manual review of an account doesn&#8217;t make much sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, let&#8217;s remember, even if the threshold is met, and we have some vouchers that are decrypted by Apple. The next stage is a manual review to determine if that account should be referred to NCMEC or not, and that is something that we want to only occur in cases where it&#8217;s a legitimate high value report. We&#8217;ve designed the system in that way, but if we consider the attack scenario you brought up, I think that&#8217;s not a very compelling outcome to an attacker.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is there a threshold of images for reporting, isn’t one piece of CSAM content too many?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to ensure that the reports that we make to NCMEC are high value and actionable, and one of the notions of all systems is that there&#8217;s some uncertainty built in to whether or not that image matched, And so the threshold allows us to reach that point where we expect a false reporting rate for review of one in 1 trillion accounts per year. So, working against the idea that we do not have any interest in looking through users&#8217; photo libraries outside those that are holding collections of known CSAM the threshold allows us to have high confidence that those accounts that we review are ones that when we refer to NCMEC, law enforcement will be able to take up and effectively investigate, prosecute and convict.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just months after raising $28 million, </span><a href="http://getjerry.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today that it has raised $75 million in a Series C round that values the company at $450 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Goodwater Capital doubled down on its investment in Jerry, leading the “oversubscribed” round. Bow Capital, Kamerra, Highland Capital Partners and Park West Asset Management also participated in the financing, which brings Jerry’s total raised to $132 million since its 2017 inception. Goodwater Capital also led the startup’s Series B </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jerry’s new valuation is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about “4x” that of the company at its Series B round, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Art Agrawal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What factored into the current valuation is our annual recurring revenue, growing customer base and total addressable market,” he told TechCrunch, declining to be more specific about ARR other than to say it is growing “at a very fast rate.” He also said the company “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to meet and exceed growth and revenue targets” with its first product, a service for comparing and buying car insurance. At the time of the company&#8217;s last raise, Agrawal said Jerry saw its revenue surge by &#8220;10x&#8221; in 2020 compared to 2019.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry, which says it has evolved its model to a mobile-first car ownership “super app,” aims to save its customers time and money on car expenses. The Palo Alto-based startup launched its car insurance comparison service using artificial intelligence and machine learning in January 2019. It has quietly since amassed nearly 1 million customers across the United States as a licensed insurance broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today as a consumer, you have to go to multiple different places to deal with different things,” Agrawal said at the time of the company’s last raise. “Jerry is out to change that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funding round fuels the launch of the company’s “compare-and-buy” marketplaces in new verticals, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing, repair, warranties, parking, maintenance and “additional money-saving services.” Although Jerry also offers a similar product for home insurance, its focus is on car ownership.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div>Agrawal told TechCrunch that the company is on track to triple last year’s policy sales, and that its policy sales volume makes Jerry the number one broker for a few of the top 10 insurance carriers.</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to reliable and affordable transportation is critical to economic empowerment,” said Rafi Syed, Jerry board member and general partner at Bow Capital, which also doubled down on its investment in the company. “Jerry is helping car owners make the most of every dollar they earn. While we see Jerry as an excellent technology investment showcasing the power of data in financial services, it’s also a high-performing investment in terms of the financial inclusion it supports.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital Partner Chi-Hua Chien said the firm’s recurring revenue model makes it stand out from lead generation-based car insurance comparison sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Agrawal agrees, noting that Jerry&#8217;s high-performing annual recurring revenue model has made the company “attractive to investors” in addition to the fact that the startup “straddles” the auto, e-commerce, fintech and insurtech industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognized those investment opportunities could drive our business faster and led to raising the round earlier than expected,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re eager to launch new categories to save customers time and money on auto expenses and the new investment shortens our time to market.”</span></p>
<p>Agrawal also believes Jerry is different from other auto-related marketplaces out there in that it aims to help consumers with various aspects of car ownership (from repair to maintenance to insurance to warranties), rather than just one. The company also believes it is set apart from competitors in that it doesn’t refer a consumer to an insurance carrier’s site so that they still have to do the work of signing up with them separately, for example. Rather, Jerry uses automation to give consumers customized quotes from more than 45 insurance carriers “in 45 seconds.” The consumers can then sign on to the new carrier via Jerry, which can then cancel former policies on their behalf.</p>
<p>Jerry makes recurring revenue from earning a percentage of the premium when a consumer purchases a policy on its site from carriers such as Progressive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, the autonomous vehicle company born out of a $4 billion joint venture with Aptiv and Hyundai, is expanding its presence in California by opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into the area follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional&#8217;s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">fully driverless robotaxi services</a> in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>While Motional declined to disclose its investment into the California expansion, the company is clearly putting its capital to work with plans to hire dozens of people and scale up operations in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Motional has had an office in Los Angeles since 2016. The LA office is where some of the company&#8217;s machine learning and hardware engineers are based. As part of its expansion plan, Motional has moved the team into a larger location in Santa Monica near the Santa Monica Pier.</p>
<p>Mortional is also opening a new operations facility located a few miles away and plans to more than double the number of employees based in Los Angeles to more than 100 people. The operations facility will support Motional&#8217;s plans to begin mapping roads and eventually testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads. Testing routes will initially be centered in and around the Santa Monica area, near its office and operations facility.</p>
<p>Motional said it will use the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/">all-electric Hyundai IONIQ 5</a>, the vehicle that will be the cornerstone of its eventual commercial robotaxi service, in its testing there. The Hyundai IONIQ 5, which was revealed in February 2021 with a consumer release date expected later this year, will be fully integrated with Motional&#8217;s driverless system. The vehicles will be equipped with the hardware and software needed for Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities such as lidar, radar and cameras. Level 4, is a designation by SAE, that means the vehicle will handle all driving operations in certain conditions and environments.</p>
<p>For now, the testing will involve autonomous vehicles with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company does not yet have a permit in the state to test its AVs without a human operator behind the wheel. That permit issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is first time the company has tested on public roads in Los Angeles. Motional already tests its AVs in Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh and Singapore.</p>
<p>Motional&#8217;s President and CEO Karl Iagnemma described this as a &#8220;doubling down&#8221; of its West Coast footprint. &#8220;This expansion is the latest in our growth trajectory and will position Motional with the talent, testing capabilities, and R&amp;D resources we need to deliver on our commercialization roadmap, Iagnemma said, adding that Los Angeles has long been an important part of its global operations.</p>
<p>Motional has also opened an office in Milpitas, a Silicon Valley town located in the southern section of the San Francisco Bay. The company&#8217;s compute design team will be based out of this office, Motional said in its announcement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi has today announced the CyberDog, an open-source quadruped robot intended for developers to “build upon” and create applications for. The machine, which resembles a beefier version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-spot-enterprise-self-charging-spot-arm-153956229.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Boston Dynamics’ Spot,</a> is a showcase for Xiaomi’s engineering know-how, including its proprietary servo motors.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2F83b74d60-f9e4-11eb-a9ff-d4be069b0cc1&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=3324989bc504a34271872aabb152715e580c9495" alt="Xiaomi CyberDog" data-uuid="9cb1a42f-f613-38a9-b7a7-139232f90084" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div>
</figure>
<p>Running the show is a version of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">NVIDIA’s Jetson Xavier NX</a>, which has been dubbed the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. In terms of being able to experience the world, CyberDog has 11 sensors over its body, including touch and ultrasonic sensors, cameras and GPS to help it “interact with its environment.”</p>
<p>Xiaomi says that this technology is good enough to enable CyberDog to follow its owner and navigate around obstacles. It is also capable of identifying posture and tracking human faces, enabling it to pick out and track individuals in a group.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2F1ddc12b0-f9de-11eb-bbdb-7d384d28c280&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=b62c015fec4baca2c1da1270b096807e213a1149" alt="Render of the Xiaomi CyberDog in all of its terrifying glory." data-uuid="02f6c36a-49e2-3729-a844-10c971d3bd7a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div>
</figure>
<p>Rather than selling this as a general-sale product, the company is for now going to release 1,000 of these things to “Xiaomi fans, engineers and robotics enthusiasts to jointly explore the immense possibility of CyberDog.” This will be facilitated by an open-source community, hosted by Xiaomi, which may be followed by the construction of a robotics laboratory to lay a pathway for “future innovations.”</p>
<p>Of course, this thing isn’t cheap, and those folks willing to get involved will need to shell out 9,999 yuan or around $1,540 to get one of these for themselves.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Privacy is emotional — we often value privacy the most when we feel vulnerable or powerless when confronted with creepy data practices. But in the eyes of the court, emotions don&#8217;t always constitute harm or a reason for structural change in how privacy is legally codified.</p>
<p>It might take a material perspective on widening privacy disparities — and their implication in broader social inequality — to catalyze the privacy improvements the U.S. desperately needs.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s leaders announced their plans for the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update in 2020. In short, iOS users can refuse an app&#8217;s ability to track their activity on other apps and websites. The ATT update has led to a sweeping <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-apple-tightens-tracking-rules-advertisers-shift-spending-toward-android-devices-11625477401">three-quarters</a> of iOS users opting out of cross-app tracking.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Whenever one user base gears up with privacy protections, companies simply redirect their data practices along the path of least resistance.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With less data available to advertisers looking to develop individual profiles for targeted advertising, targeted ads for iOS users look less effective and appealing to ad agencies. As a result, new findings show that advertisers are spending <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apples-iphone-is-so-good-at-protecting-privacy-advertisers-are-giving-up-and-switching-to-android/">one-third less</a> in advertising spending on iOS devices.</p>
<p>They are redirecting that capital into advertising on Android systems, which<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"> account</a> for just over 42.06% of the mobile OS market share, compared to iOS at 57.62%.</p>
<p>Beyond a vague sense of creepiness, privacy disparities increasingly pose risks of material harm: emotional, reputational, economic and otherwise. If privacy belongs to all of us, as many tech companies say, then why does it cost so much? Whenever one user base gears up with privacy protections, companies simply redirect their data practices along the path of least resistance, toward the populations with fewer resources, legal or technical, to control their data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>More than just ads</h2>
<p>As more money goes into Android ads, we could expect advertising techniques to become more sophisticated, or at least more aggressive. It is not illegal for companies to engage in targeted advertising, so long as it is done in compliance with users&#8217; legal rights to opt out under relevant laws like CCPA in California.</p>
<p>This raises two immediate issues. First, residents of every state except California currently lack such opt-out rights. Second, granting some users the right to opt out of targeted advertising strongly implies that there are harms, or at least risks, to targeted advertising. And indeed, there can be.</p>
<p>Targeted advertising involves third parties building and maintaining behind-the-scenes profiles of users based on their behavior. Gathering data on app activity, such as fitness habits or shopping patterns, could lead to further inferences about sensitive aspects of a user&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>At this point, a representation of a user exists in an under-regulated data system containing — whether correctly or incorrectly inferenced — data that the user did not consent to sharing. (Unless the user lives in California, but let&#8217;s suppose they live anywhere else in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Further, research finds that targeted advertising, in building detailed profiles of users, can enact discrimination in<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-targeted-ads-and-dynamic-pricing-can-perpetuate-bias"> housing and employment opportunities</a>, sometimes in violation of federal law. And targeted advertising can impede individuals&#8217; autonomy, preemptively narrowing their window of purchasing options, even when they don&#8217;t want to. On the other hand, targeted advertising can support niche or grassroots organizations in connecting them directly with interested audiences. Regardless of a stance on targeted advertising, the underlying problem is when users have no say in whether they are subject to it.</p>
<p>Targeted advertising is a massive and booming practice, but it is only one practice within a broader web of business activities that do not prioritize respect for users&#8217; data. And these practices are not illegal in much of the U.S. Instead of the law, your pocketbook can keep you clear of data disrespect.</p>
<h2>Privacy as a luxury</h2>
<p>Prominent tech companies, particularly Apple, declare privacy a human right, which makes complete sense from a business standpoint. In the absence of the U.S. federal government codifying privacy rights for all consumers, a bold privacy commitment from a private company sounds pretty appealing.</p>
<p><em>If the government isn&#8217;t going to set a privacy standard, at least my phone manufacturer will</em>. Even though only<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/04/how-americans-see-digital-privacy-issues-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/"> 6%</a> of Americans claim to understand how companies use their data, it is companies that are making the broad privacy moves.</p>
<p>But if those declaring privacy as a human right only make products affordable to some, what does that say about our human rights? Apple products skew toward<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Infographics/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users"> wealthier, more educated consumers</a> compared to competitors&#8217; products. This projects a troubling future of increasingly exacerbated privacy disparities between the haves and the have-nots, where a feedback loop is established: Those with fewer resources to acquire privacy protections may have fewer resources to navigate the technical and legal challenges that come with a practice as convoluted as targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take this as me siding with Facebook in its feud with Apple about privacy versus affordability (see:<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-fired-dozens-abusing-access-user-data-an-ugly-truth-2021-7"> systemic access control issues</a> recently coming to light). In my view, neither side of that battle is winning.</p>
<p>We deserve meaningful privacy protections that everyone can afford. In fact, to turn the phrase on its head, <em>we deserve meaningful privacy protections that no company can afford to omit from their products. </em>We deserve a both/and approach: privacy that is both meaningful and widely available.</p>
<h2>Our next steps forward</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, there are two key areas for privacy progress: privacy legislation and privacy tooling for developers. I again invoke the both/and approach. We need lawmakers, rather than tech companies, setting reliable privacy standards for consumers. And we need widely available developer tools that give developers no reason — financially, logistically or otherwise — not to implement privacy at the product level.</p>
<p>On privacy legislation, I believe that policy professionals are already raising some excellent points, so I&#8217;ll direct you to some of my favorite recent writing from them.</p>
<p>Stacey Gray and her team at the Future of Privacy Forum have begun an excellent<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/preemption-in-us-federal-privacy-laws/"> blog series</a> on how a federal privacy law could interact with the emerging patchwork of state laws.</p>
<p>Joe Jerome published an outstanding<a href="https://techpolicy.press/a-post-mortem-on-state-privacy-legislation/"> recap</a> of the 2021 state-level privacy landscape and the routes toward widespread privacy protections for all Americans. A key takeaway: The effectiveness of privacy regulation hinges on how well it harmonizes among individuals and businesses. That&#8217;s not to say that regulation should be business-friendly, but rather that businesses should be able to reference clear privacy standards so they can confidently and respectfully handle everyday folks&#8217; data.</p>
<p>On privacy tooling, if we make privacy tools readily accessible and affordable for all developers, we really leave tech with zero excuses to meet privacy standards. Take the issue of access control, for instance. Engineers attempt to build manual controls over which personnel and end users can access various data in a complex data ecosystem already populated with sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>The challenge is twofold. First, the horse has already bolted. Technical debt accumulates rapidly, while privacy has remained outside of software development. Engineers need tools that enable them to build privacy features like nuanced access control prior to production.</p>
<p>This leads into the second aspect of the challenge: Even if the engineers overcame all of the technical debt and could make structural privacy improvements at the code level, what standards and widely available tools are available to use?</p>
<p>As a June 2021<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/new-fpf-report-highlights-privacy-tech-sector-evolving-from-compliance-tools-to-platforms-for-risk-management-and-data-utilization/"> report</a> from the Future of Privacy Forum makes clear, privacy technology is in dire need of consistent definitions, which are required for widespread adoption of trustworthy privacy tools. With more consistent definitions and widely available developer tools for privacy, these technical transformations translate into material improvements in how tech at large — not just tech of Brand XYZ — gives users control over their data.</p>
<p>We need privacy rules set by an institution that is not itself playing the game. Regulation alone cannot save us from modern privacy perils, but it is a vital ingredient in any viable solution.</p>
<p>Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The deal is notable because it is Robinhood's first major purchase since going public in July, and because it illustrates where Robinhood may look to invest some of its newly liquid equity wealth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. consumer investing and trading service Robinhood announced this morning that it will acquire Say Technologies in a $140 million cash deal.</p>
<p>Say Technologies is a venture-backed startup, having <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/asayinc/company_financials">raised $8 million in 2018, per Crunchbase data</a>. <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company was worth $28 million on a post-money basis following the investment, implying that the company&#8217;s backers managed a roughly 5x return on their investment.</p>
<p>Say was backed by Point72 Ventures, among other investors.</p>
<p>The deal is notable because it is Robinhood&#8217;s first major purchase since going public in late July, and because it illustrates where Robinhood may look to invest some of its newly liquid equity wealth; when a company goes public, it can more easily purchase other companies thanks to recharged cash balances and a floating stock.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Robinhood <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/8/10/say-technologies-is-joining-robinhood">wrote</a> that &#8220;Say was built on the belief that everyone should have the same access to the financial markets as Wall Street insiders.&#8221; What does that mean? In practice, Say has built a communications platform that allows even smaller shareholders to pose questions to the companies in which they invest. Sure, some companies are including retail questions in their earnings calls, but what Say has in mind is broader.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OYzir089JD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/embed/#?secret=OYzir089JD" data-secret="OYzir089JD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You can see how Say and Robinhood might fit together. Robinhood has a huge user pool of retail investors who like to trade and invest. Say has the technology to connect retail investors to the companies that they own. With Robinhood&#8217;s database of which retail investor owns what, and Say&#8217;s communications tech, the trading platform may be able to offer a better shareholder experience than what rival platforms can offer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By offering to its user base a service like what Say has built, Robinhood can offer a unique twist on retail investing. This feels somewhat analogous to Spotify spending heavily to procure exclusive rights to certain podcasts; such efforts differentiate Spotify from rivals despite having a commoditized core offering. Trading is now free in many places, so Robinhood layering specialized services on top of its investing service makes good sense, perhaps helping drive user loyalty and net new-user adds.</p>
<p>Shares of Robinhood are off around 1.2% today, despite generally higher markets. We might say that investors were selling lightly in wake of the news, but that would be a somewhat bold read of the day&#8217;s trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our Extra Crunch Live series continues with some heavy hitters in August, including Jen Nwankwo, founder and CEO at 1910 Genetics, and Playground Global general partner Jory Bell. They&#8217;ll be with us live on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-playground-global-and-1910-genetics">August 11 at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET)</a> to tell us all about how Nwankwo and her startup won over Bell and Playground as an investor, and as we do every week on Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll conduct a live pitch feedback session featuring you, the members of our audience.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live gives you the chance to hear live from entrepreneurs who have successfully raised significant rounds of venture capital &#8212; and from the investors who believed in them. We go into detail about how the deal got done, and you&#8217;ll hear from both about what it takes to pitch VCs and what industry-leading VCs look for in prospective portfolio companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have Nwankwo and Bell joining us for this episode. Nwankwo founded and leads 1910 Genetics, which takes advantage of AI to accelerate the discovery and development of new drug therapies across a wide range of disease and condition categories. She has a Ph.D. in pharmacology and experimental therapeutics from Tufts University School of Medicine and participated in drug discovery development that led to the creation of Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity prior to her graduate school work.</p>
<p>Bell&#8217;s career includes designing and building autonomous robots for deep-sea exploration, as well as a six-year stint at Apple designing notebooks for the consumer technology leader. Bell&#8217;s venture investment work began at Playground Global in 2015; he focuses on deep tech investments, including in aerospace, genomics, synthetic biology, and AI-assisted drug discovery, as in the case of 1910 Genetics.</p>
