										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A large chunk of the internet dropped offline on Thursday. Some of the most popular sites, apps and services on the internet were down, including UPS and FedEx (which have since come back online), Airbnb, Fidelity, and others are reporting Steam, LastPass, and the PlayStation Network are all experiencing downtime.</p>
<p>Many other websites around the world are also affected, including media outlets in Europe.</p>
<p>What appears to be the cause is an outage at Akamai, an internet security giant that provides networking and content delivery services to companies. At around 11am ET, Akamai <a href="https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv">reported an issue</a> with its Edge DNS, a service that&#8217;s designed to keep websites, apps and services running smoothly and securely.</p>
<p>DNS services are critically important to how the internet works, so when things go wrong or there&#8217;s an outage, it can cause a knock-on effect to all of the customer websites and services that rely on it.</p>
<p>Akamai said it was &#8220;actively investigating the issue,&#8221; but when reached a spokesperson would not say if its outage was the cause of the disruption to other sites and services that are currently offline. Akamai would not say what caused the issue but that it was already in recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have implemented a fix for this issue, and based on current observations, the service is resuming normal operations. We will continue to monitor to ensure that the impact has been fully mitigated,&#8221; Akamai told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time we&#8217;ve seen an outage this big. Last year Cloudflare, which also provides networking services to companies around the world, had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/cloudflare-dns-goes-down-taking-a-large-piece-of-the-internet-with-it/">similar outage</a> following a bug that caused major sites to stop loading, including Shopify, Discord and Politico. In November, Amazon&#8217;s cloud service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/amazon-web-services-outage-takes-a-portion-of-the-internet-down-with-it/">also stumbled</a>, which prevented it from updating its own status page during the incident. Online workspace startup Notion also had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/notion-outage-dns-domain-issues/">a high-profile outage</a> this year, forcing the company to turn to Twitter to ask for help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s central bank is considering launching a digital currency, according to a top executive, giving a clear indication of its intentions for the first time after previously stating that it was studying the idea.</p>
<p>T Rabi Sankar, the deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India, said at a conference today that the central bank is considering introducing the nation’s digital currency in a “phased” manner while legal changes are made to the South Asian nation’s foreign-exchange rules and IT laws.</p>
<p>The digital currency, which will be backed by sovereign, will lower the economy’s reliance on cash, enable cheaper and smoother international settlements, and protect people from the volatility of privacy cryptocurrencies, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every idea has to wait for its time, and the time for CBDC [central bank digital currency] is near. We have carefully evaluated the risks,” he told an audience at a conference held by think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.</p>
<p>Sankar said the central bank’s “endeavor is that as we move forward [with the plan],” so that India’s digital currency “can reiterate its leadership position in payment systems of the world.”</p>
<p>The top executive’s remarks follows European Central Bank saying last week that it will begin a 24-month “investigation phase” that, if successful, could lead to the creation of a digital euro by 2025.</p>
<p>Also last week, China&#8217;s central bank said its digital yuan trial had reached $5.3 billion in transaction value by the end of June.</p>
<p>“Central banks have increased their attention on digital currencies,” said Sankar. &#8220;CBDC will be in the arsenal of most if not all central banks in the world. A calibrated and nuanced approach will be considered at the drawing board as well as with stakeholder consultations,” he said, adding that the central bank has been exploring the benefits and risks of issuing a sovereign CBDC for “quite some time.”</p>
<p>“We have studied specific-purpose CBDCs proposed by different central banks around the world for wholesale and retail segments. The launch of a general-purpose CBDC for population scale is being considered, and RBI is working towards a phased introduction strategy and examining use cases with little or no disruption of India’s banking and monetary systems,” he said. &#8220;However, conducting pilots in wholesale and retail segments may be a possibility in near future.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his remarks, Sankar also hinted that the central bank hasn&#8217;t changed its stand on private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2018, an Indian government panel recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to 10 years of jail time for offenders. The panel also suggested the government to explore a digital version of the fiat currency and ways to implement it.</p>
<p>At the time, RBI said the move was necessary to curb “ring-fencing” of the country’s financial system. It had also argued that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be treated as currencies as they are not made of metal or exist in physical form, nor were they stamped by the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not commodities or claims on commodities as they have no intrinsic value; some claims that they are akin to gold clearly seem opportunistic,&#8221; Sankar said today.</p>
<p>The 2018 notice from the central bank sent a panic to several local startups and companies offering services to trade in cryptocurrency. Nearly all of them have either since closed shop, or pivoted to serve other markets.</p>
<p>This proposal was challenged by several exchanges and traders, who filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. The nation’s apex court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/india-lifts-ban-on-cryptocurrency-trading/">ruled in their favor last year</a>. This ruling was seen as “historic” but it has yet to impact the earlier circular on the policy level. In the meantime, the country has hinted that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>In the agenda published on the lower house website earlier this year, a legislation sought to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India,” but allow “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology [blockchain] of cryptocurrency and its uses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a>, the &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery startup that has been on an acquisition and expansion tear in the last several months to scale its business, is also racing to raise money to fuel those efforts. Documents uncovered by <a href="https://primeunicornindex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Unicorn Index</a> and shared with TechCrunch show that the startup has filed papers in Delaware to raise up to $750 million in a Series H round of funding &#8212; at a valuation of $13.5 billion if all shares are issued. While the company is not commenting on the filing, a well-placed source tells us that it&#8217;s actually closing as a $1 billion raise at a $15 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As with all Delaware filings, they only tell part of the story, so the company might ultimately raise more or less before the round closes. (And in this case it looks like &#8220;more.&#8221;)</p>
<p>For some funding context, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/gopuff-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only in March</a> that Gopuff raised $1.15 billion at an $8.9 billion valuation. And that round came just months after a $380 million round (at a $3.8 billion) valuation. With Gopuff&#8217;s instant grocery model comes instant funding, it seems: together the three rounds would total around $2.5 billion in funding in the space of 10 months. (Investors in the company&#8217;s previous rounds have included Accel, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Eldridge, Reinvent Capital, Luxor Capital, and SoftBank.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much like the investment race in the transportation-on-demand market, a large part of the fundraising in instant grocery seems to be aimed at scaling as fast as possible to build technological, operational and customer moats.</p>
<p>So for Gopuff, some of the money it&#8217;s raised so far has been used to expand organically. That is, it&#8217;s investing to acquire new customers and build out its infrastructure &#8212; riders, &#8220;dark&#8221; stores stocked with their products, and most recently &#8220;Gopuff kitchens&#8221; &#8212; within the 650+ cities in the U.S. where it already operates its $1.95 flat fee &#8220;in minutes&#8221; delivery service. It will likely be doing so at a particularly fast pace, considering that others like DoorDash are also moving in to compete in earnest around the same model for quick deliveries of a limited selection of food and drinks, home essentials, and over-the-counter medication.</p>
<p>But alongside that, some of the cash it is amassing is also being used for acquisitions. So far, these have been limited to the U.S. and to expand Gopuff&#8217;s breadth in that market. It bought alcohol retailer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BevMo for $350 million</a> in November 2020; and in June of this year Gopuff acquired logistics tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/delivery-service-gopuff-acquires-rideos-for-115-million-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rideOS for $115 million</a>.</p>
<p>The next stage of that acquisition process looks like it may be focused on snapping up similar companies in key markets where Gopuff wants to be in the future, particularly internationally, as it works to fill out a reported ambition of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/gopuff-revenue-triples-but-growing-competition-to-test-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching $1 billion in revenues this year</a> (3x last year&#8217;s numbers).</p>
<p>In June, there were <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors around that Gopuff had approached Flink</a>, an instant grocery player in Germany. While that has not gone anywhere (yet?), well-placed sources have told us &#8212; and, it seems, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/dija-acquisition-gopuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a> &#8212; that Gopuff is also casting its international eye on England, engaging in discussions to acquire two different instant delivery companies based out of London, first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fancy</a> back in February, and more recently, <a href="https://www.dijanow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a>.</p>
<p>Gopuff also declined to coment on Dija but we have multiple, well-placed sources telling us it&#8217;s in the works.</p>
<p>London is a hugely competitive market for instant grocery delivery at the moment &#8212; not least because it is dense and often hard to get around, has demonstrated a strong consumer appetite for on-demand delivery services, and has a population of younger people with a decent amount of disposable income to pay a little more for convenience.</p>
<p>That speaks of opportunity, but also possibly too many hopefuls as well. In addition to Dija and Fance, we have Turkey&#8217;s Getir, backed by Sequoia and a number of others on an ambitious international roll at the moment; Gorillas (like Flink, from Berlin); Zapp; and Weezy &#8212; all offering &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery. And these are just the standalone, newer startups. Still to come: established restaurant delivery players like Deliveroo that might also throw their hats into the ring.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that field, we&#8217;ve heard that Dija has been struggling to raise more money, and that led to the startup looking for buyers as an alternative.</p>
<p>That is a trend that&#8217;s playing out elsewhere too: In Spain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir earlier this month acquired Blok</a>, another new instant player that was struggling to get investors on board. We confirmed with well-placed sources that Dija had also talked with Getir in this context (that didn&#8217;t go anywhere) before Gopuff entered the picture. There will likely be more of these.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a bloodbath,&#8221; is how one big investor recently described the instant grocery market to me.</p>
<p>Given that online grocery remains a relatively minor part of the market &#8212; even with the pandemic and its habit-changing impact on e-commerce, it&#8217;s still under 10% of sales, even in the most adoption-friendly cities &#8212; there is still a lot to play for in &#8220;instant&#8221; groceries. But if this latest round shows us anything, it&#8217;s that the most promising of these delivery companies will continue raising a lot more money to position themselves as consolidators within it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine a world where no one&#8217;s privacy is breached, no faces are scanned into a gargantuan database, and no privacy laws are broken. This is a world that is fast approaching. Could companies simply dump the need for real-world CCTV footage, and switch to synthetic humans, acting out potential scenarios a million times over? That’s the tantalizing prospect of a new UK startup that has attracted funding from an influential set of investors.</p>
<p>UK-based <a href="https://www.mindtech.global/">Mindtech Global</a> has developed what it describes as an end-to-end synthetic data creation platform. In plain English, its system can imagine visual scenarios such as someone&#8217;s behavior inside a store, or crossing the street. This data is then used to train AI-based computer vision systems for customers such as big retailers, warehouse operators, healthcare, transportation systems and robotics. It literally trains a &#8216;synthetic&#8217; CCTV camera inside a synthetic world.</p>
<p>It’s now closed a $3.25 million early-stage funding round led by UK regional backer <a href="https://www.mercia.co.uk/fund/npif-mercia-equity-finance/">NPIF – Mercia Equity Finance</a>, with <a href="https://dtl.vc/">Deeptech Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.iqt.org/">In-Q-Tel</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last investor is significant. In-Q-Tel invests in startups that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel">support</a> US intelligence capabilities and is based in Arlington, Virginia…</p>
<p>Mindtech’s Chameleon platform is designed to help computers understand and predict human interactions. As we all know, current approaches to training AI vision systems require companies to source data such as CCTV footage. The process is fraught with privacy issues, costly, and time-consuming. Mindtech says Chameleon solves that problem, as its customers quickly “build unlimited scenes and scenarios using photo-realistic smart 3D models”.</p>
<p>An added bonus is that these synthetic humans can be used to train AI vision systems to weed out human failings around diversity and bias.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181000" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181000" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg" alt="Mindtech CEO Steve Harris" width="692" height="553" class="size-full wp-image-2181000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Mindtech-CEO-Steve-Harris.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181000" class="wp-caption-text">Mindtech CEO Steve Harris</p></div></p>
<p>Steve Harris, CEO, Mindtech said: “Machine learning teams can spend up to 80% of their time sourcing, cleaning, and organizing training data. Our Chameleon platform solves the AI training challenge, freeing the industry to focus on higher-value tasks like AI network innovation. This round will enable us to accelerate our growth, enabling a new generation of AI solutions that better understand the way humans interact with each other and the world around them.”</p>
<p>So what can you do with it? Consider the following: A kid slips from its parent’s hand at the mall. The synthetic CCTV running inside Mindtech’s scenario is trained thousands of times over how to spot it in real-time and alert staff. Another: a delivery robot meets kids playing in a street and works out how to how to avoid them. Finally: a passenger on the platform is behaving erratically too close to the rails – the CCTV is trained to automatically spot them and send help.</p>
<p>Nat Puffer, Managing Director (London), In-Q-Tel commented: “Mindtech impressed us with the maturity of their Chameleon platform and their commercial traction with global customers. We’re excited by the many applications this platform has across diverse markets and its ability to remove a significant roadblock in the development of smarter, more intuitive AI systems.”</p>
<p>Miles Kirby, CEO, Deeptech Labs said: “As a catalyst for deeptech success, our investment, and accelerator program supports ambitious teams with novel solutions and the appetite to build world-changing companies. Mindtech’s highly-experienced team are on a mission to disrupt the way AI systems are trained, and we’re delighted to support their journey.”</p>
<p>There is of course potential for darker applications, such a spotting petty theft inside supermarkets, or perhaps &#8216;optimising&#8217; hard-pressed warehouse workers in some dystopian fashion. However, in theory, Mindtech&#8217;s customers can use this platform to rid themselves of the biases of middle-managers, and better serve customers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The co-founders set out to build an email marketing automation platform for customers that wanted to do more than email campaigns and newsletters.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sendlane.com/">Sendlane</a>, a San Diego-based multichannel marketing automation platform, announced Thursday it raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Five Elms Capital and others invested in the round to give Sendlane total funding of $23 million since the company was founded in 2018.</p>
<p>Though the company officially started three years ago, co-founder and CEO Jimmy Kim told TechCrunch he began working on the idea back in 2013 with two other co-founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They were all email marketers in different lines of business, but had some common ground in that they were all using email tools they didn’t like. The ones they did like came with too big of a price tag for a small business, Kim said. They set out to build their own email marketing automation platform for customers that wanted to do more than email campaigns and newsletters.</p>
<p>When two other companies Kim was involved in exited in 2017, he decided to put both feet into Sendlane to build it into a system that maximized revenue based on insights and integrations.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the company attracted seed funding from Zing Capital and decided in 2019 to pivot into e-commerce. “Based on our personal backgrounds and looking at the customers we worked with, we realized that is what we did best,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Today, more than 1,700 e-commerce companies use Sendlane’s platform to convert more than 100 points of their customers’ data — abandoned carts, which products sell the best and which marketing channel is working — into engaging communications aimed at driving customer loyalty. The company said it can increase revenue for customers between 20% and 40% on average.</p>
<p>The company itself is growing 100% year over year and seeing over $7 million in annual recurring revenue. It currently has 54 employees right now, and Kim expects to be at around 90 by the end of the year and 150 by the end of 2022. Sendlane currently has more than 20 open roles, he said.</p>
<p>That current and potential growth was a driver for Kim to go after the Series A funding. He said Sendlane became profitable last year, which is why it has not raised a lot of money so far. However, as the rapid adoption of e-commerce continues, Kim wants to be ready for the next wave of competition coming in, which he expects in the next year.</p>
<p>He considers companies like ActiveCampaign and Klaviyo to be in line with Sendlane, but says his company’s differentiator is customer service, boasting short wait times and chats that answer questions in less than 15 seconds.</p>
<p>He is also ready to go after the next vision, which is to unify data and insights to create meaningful interactions between customers and retailers.</p>
<p>“We want to start carving out a new space,” Kim added. “We have a ton of new products coming out in the next 12 to 18 months and want to be the single source for customer journey data insights that provides flexibility for your business to grow.”</p>
<p>Two upcoming tools include Audiences, which will unify customer data and provide insights, and an SMS product for two-way communications and enabled campaign-level sending.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The myriad emerging and longer-term transportation technologies promise to change how people and packages move about the world or within their own neighborhoods. They also present myriad regulatory and policy hurdles that lawmakers, advocates and even investors and industry executives are attempting to navigate.</p>
<p>At the center — at least in the United States — sits Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. The small-town mayor in Indiana turned presidential candidate and now cabinet member under the Biden administration oversees public transport, highway safety and nascent technologies like autonomous vehicles. The Harvard graduate, Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University and former U.S. Navy officer is in a position to bring complexity or clarity to the future of transportation.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt 2021</a>, Secretary Buttigieg will join us for a fireside chat where we&#8217;ll dig into some of the thorniest questions around transportation and how to ensure that moving from Point A to Point B is a universal right, not a privilege. We&#8217;ll ask Buttigieg about micromobility and public transit, President Biden&#8217;s push for the federal government to use electric vehicles, autonomous vehicle guidance and new regulatory requirements around reporting vehicle crashes when an advanced driver assistance and automated driving system is engaged — a move that could spur a new wave of startups and benefit some in-car technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upshot: If it involves technology that moves people and packages, we aim to talk about it.</p>
<p>Secretary Buttigieg is just one of the many high-profile speakers who will be on our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt Stage</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=petebuttigiegpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=petebuttigiegpost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extra Crunch Stage</a>. During the three-day event, writer, director, actor and <strong>Houseplant</strong> co-founder <strong>Seth Rogen</strong> will be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr to talk about the business of weed, <strong>Duolingo</strong> CEO and co-founder<strong> Luis von Ahn</strong> will discuss gamifying education and prepping for a public offering and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will dig into the volatile world of cryptocurrency and his company&#8217;s massive direct listing earlier this year.</p>
<p>Other speakers include Twitter CISO <strong>Rinki Sethi</strong>, Calendly founder and CEO <strong>Tope Awotona</strong>, Mirror co-founder and CEO <strong>Brynn Putnam</strong>, Evil Geniuses CEO <strong>Nicole LaPointe Jameson</strong> and Andreessen Horowitz General Partner <strong>Katie Haun</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Continuing our global look into the torrid pace of venture capital investment in the second quarter, today we turn to Canada. While many markets have posted impressive results, like the United States setting the pace for new all-time records in dollars invested into startups, Canada’s numbers stand out.</p>
<p>The country, now famous in the startup world for giving birth to Shopify, has already crushed prior yearly records for venture investment thus far in 2021. Indeed, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">CB Insights data indicates</a> that Canadian startups this year have already raised more than double their 2020 totals.</p>
<p>The same data set indicates that Canada’s venture capital results now rival those of the entire Latin American region, with exits and megadeals coming in roughly on par in the second quarter, and a similar number of total venture capital rounds in the period.</p>
<p>That caught our attention.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>The Exchange reached out to a number of venture capitalists to expand our perspective on the Canadian market beyond the data points. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattybcohen">Matt Cohen</a>, a Toronto-based investor at <a href="https://www.rippleventures.com/">Ripple Ventures</a>, told The Exchange that “Canada is in a venture explosion” today, leading to results that are “unprecedented” for the country.</p>

Let’s talk aboot it.</p>
<h2>A venture capital blowout</h2>
<p>In the first half of 2021, Canadian startups raised $6.3 billion across 414 deals, per CB Insights data. Both numbers compare favorably to Canada’s 2020 results, when 617 deals led to $2.9 billion in total capital raised by Canadian startups. Canada has already bested its previous record in venture dollars invested ($4.3 billion, 2019), and is on pace to beat its all-time deal count as well (720, 2018).</p>
<p>By itself, the second quarter’s outsize results are even more extreme than its H1 2021 results might have led you to expect, amazingly. Observe the following chart from the same data set:</p>
<p><div style="width: 879px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-9.39.01-AM.png" alt="" width="869" height="497" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CB Insights</p></div></p>
<p>Canadian startups just had their single best quarter ever in both deal volume and dollar volume terms. Furthermore, the country boosted capital raised by nearly 10x from its local minimum in Q4 2020.</p>
<p>Notably, no Canadian startup deal in the quarter was worth more than $500 million; indeed, Trulioo’s $394 million Series D was the largest. From there the list includes $300 million for ApplyBoard’s Series D and Vena’s $242 million Series C. We read that list of results as indicative of an investing landscape in Canada that is not dominated by a handful of companies raising billion-dollar rounds. That’s good news, mind you: The data implies that the Canadian startup market is not being bolstered by one or two standout companies, but rather performing well more generally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I did a bit of a double-take on this one: $100 million is a big number at any point, but two-and-a-half months after a $56 million round is pretty wild. At the very least, we know<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/"> Path Robotics</a> is ready to put its money where its mouth is &#8212; and that Tiger Global likes what it sees in the welding robotics firm.</p>
<p>The “pre-emptive” Series C brings its total funding to $171 and leapfrogs it toward the top of the most well-funded construction robotics companies. There’s a lot of room here, of course. The global construction market is in the tens of trillions of dollars, annually. And one of the beauties of the industry is precisely how many flanks there are to attack it from.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179597" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179597" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2179597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179597" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Path Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Path’s particular funding…well, path, points to ambitions beyond welding. But that’s a good place to start, with a massive labor shortage of around 400,000 jobs in the U.S. alone by 2024. Tiger Global partner Griffin Schroeder pulls the curtain back a touch, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Path’s innovative approach to computer vision and proprietary AI software allows robots to sense, understand and adapt to the challenges of each unique welding project.

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/verve-motion-raises-15m-following-exosuit-pilot-with-grocery-workers/">Verve Motion’s funding</a> round just barely missed the cutoff for roundup inclusion last week. It’s tough when your lead-in is a $100 million round, but $15 million’s certainly nothing to scoff at. A spinout of some of the really interesting work being done at Conor Walsh&#8217;s lab at Harvard’s Wyss Institute and the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Verve Motion is one of a number of startups in the exoskeleton/exosuit category.</p>

<p>There are two largely distinct audiences for this tech: people with mobility issues and the blue-collar labor force. For now, at least, Verve is targeting the latter, with its soft exosuits designed to help reduce workplace injuries from activities like repetitive lifting. Honestly, it fits the dull, dirty, dangerous paradigm pretty well.</p>

<p>Less fun news out of OpenAI, which quietly disbanded its robotics team. The move actually came last October, but<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/16/openai-disbands-its-robotics-research-team/"> Venture Beat reported on it last week.</a> The team was probably best known for its Rubik’s Cube-solving robotics hand &#8212; a fascinating project, but apparently a bit of a dead end. Quoting a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>After advancing the state of the art in reinforcement learning through our Rubik’s Cube project and other initiatives, last October we decided not to pursue further robotics research and instead refocus the team on other projects. Because of the rapid progress in AI and its capabilities, we’ve found that other approaches, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback, lead to faster progress in our reinforcement learning research.</p></blockquote>

<p>And in the department of horribly butchering a funny thing Mark Twain once said, reports of Pepper’s death are…if not exaggerated, than at least disputed by the source. What remains clear is that the robotic face of Softbank wasn’t doing what the firm had hoped, and at the very least, it has decided to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing refurbished sales of the signage-holding humanoid bot, Softbank Robotics CMO Kazutaka Hasumi<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/softbanks-robotics-ambitions-short-circuit-pepper-loses-power-2021-07-21/"> told Reuters</a>, &#8220;We will still be selling Pepper in five years.” It’s hard to know what to make of that. As far as these things go, Pepper wasn’t a particularly useful robot, in spite of it having a solid pedigree owing to Softbank’s acquisition of French firm, Aldebaran.</p>
<p>At the very least, the company is mulling over some kind of redesign. That alone seems unlikely to move the needle much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz laid out Thursday a 40 billion-euro ($47B) plan to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade, a target that will push the company to become more vertically integrated, train its workforce and secure the batteries needed to power its products.</p>
<p>Mercedes has provide some wiggle room in that ambitious goal, noting that it will be &#8220;ready to go all electric by the end of the decade, where markets allow.&#8221; This could mean that some combustion engine Mercedes, which are already equipped with 48-volt mild hybrid systems, will be produced and sold beyond the decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a very clear plan to rapidly scale BEVs; we want to get on this journey to a BEV (battery electric) only world,&#8221; Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG CEO Ola Källenius said during a media call after the announcement. &#8220;We want to be the people that make that happen, not just let it happen for us and go with the flow, but really taking initiative. And we believe also that the luxury segment, where we belong, has all the hallmarks of being a leading segment for this transition.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has already taken some action, announcing Thursday it acquired UK-based electric motor company YASA and has determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with partners to produce cells.</p>
<p>The new plants, one of which will be located in the United States, is on top of the company&#8217;s already planned network of nine factories that will be dedicated to building battery systems. The company said it will team up with new European partners to develop and efficiently produce future cells and modules. That &#8220;European partners&#8221; designation is strategic and one that Mercedes says will ensure the region &#8220;remains at the heart of the auto industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercedes said it has partnered with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery materials startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/sila-nanotechnologies-raises-590m-to-fund-battery-materials-factory/">raised $590 million</a> earlier this year, to help it improve its next generation of batteries. Specifically, SilaNano is helping Mercedes  increase energy density by using silicon-carbon composite in the anode, which should boost range and allow for shorter charging times.</p>
<p>Mercedes is also looking into solid-state battery technology and said it is in talks with partners to develop batteries with even higher energy density and safety.</p>
<p>The plan unveiled Thursday piggybacks on previous goals to build and sell more EVs. Back in 2017, Mercedes said it would electrify — which means gas-hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery electric — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/mercedes-benz-will-electrify-its-entire-car-lineup-by-2022/">entire lineup by 2022</a>. The German automaker said Thursday that by next year it will offer battery-electric vehicles in every segment that it serves.</p>
<p>Its EV-only plan will accelerate from there. By 2025, the company said its three newly launched vehicle architectures will be electric-only. The company said it expects that all-electric and hybrids will make up 50% of its sales that&#8217;s up from its previous guidance of 25%. Customers will also be to choose an all-electric alternative for every model the company makes.</p>
<p>Källenius said the company&#8217;s goal marks a &#8220;profound reallocation of capital.&#8221; He stressed that the company&#8217;s profitability targets would be safeguarded and met despite this hefty investment and shift away from the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>To meet this target, Mercedes is launching three electric-only architectures which will form the basis of all of its new vehicles. It&#8217;s so-called MB.EA platform will be used for its medium to large passenger cars, while AMG.EA will underpin its performance Mercedes-AMG cars and the VAN.EA will be dedicated architecture for electric passenger minivans and light commercial vehicles. The company has already announced its &#8220;electric first&#8221; compact car architecture, known as MMA, will launch in vehicles by 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeepMind and several research partners have released a database containing the 3D structures of nearly every protein in the human body, as computationally determined by the breakthrough protein folding system demonstrated last year, AlphaFold. The freely available database represents an enormous advance and convenience for scientists across hundreds of disciplines and domains, and may very well form the foundation of a new phase in biology and medicine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">AlphaFold Protein Structure Database</a> is a collaboration between DeepMind, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a> and others, and consists of hundreds of thousands of protein sequences with their structures predicted by AlphaFold — and the plan is to add millions more to create a &#8220;protein almanac of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this work represents the most significant contribution AI has made to advancing the state of scientific knowledge to date, and is a great example of the kind of benefits AI can bring to society,&#8221; said DeepMind founder and CEO Demis Hassabis.</p>
<h2>From genome to proteome</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with proteomics in general — and it&#8217;s quite natural if that&#8217;s the case — the best way to think about this is perhaps in terms of another major effort: that of sequencing the human genome. As you may recall from the late &#8217;90s and early &#8217;00s, this was a huge endeavor undertaken by a large group of scientists and organizations across the globe and over many years. The genome, finished at last, has been instrumental to the diagnosis and understanding of countless conditions, and in the development of drugs and treatments for them.</p>
<p>It was, however, just the beginning of the work in that field — like finishing all the edge pieces of a giant puzzle. And one of the next big projects everyone turned their eyes toward in those years was understanding the human <em>proteome</em> — which is to say all the proteins used by the human body and encoded into the genome.</p>
<p>The problem with the proteome is that it&#8217;s much, <em>much</em> more complex. Proteins, like DNA, are sequences of known molecules; in DNA these are the handful of familiar bases (adenine, guanine, etc.), but in proteins they are the 20 amino acids (each of which is coded by multiple bases in genes). This in itself creates a great deal more complexity, but it&#8217;s only the start. The sequences aren&#8217;t simply &#8220;code&#8221; but actually twist and fold into tiny molecular origami machines that accomplish all kinds of tasks within our body. It&#8217;s like going from binary code to a complex language that manifests objects in the real world.</p>
<p>Practically speaking this means that the proteome is made up of not just 20,000 sequences of hundreds of acids each, but that each one of those sequences has a physical structure and function. And one of the hardest parts of understanding them is figuring out what shape is made from a given sequence. This is generally done experimentally using something like x-ray crystallography, a long, complex process that may take months or longer to figure out a single protein — if you happen to have the best labs and techniques at your disposal. The structure can also be predicted computationally, though the process has never been good enough to actually rely on — until AlphaFold came along.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet&#8217;s DeepMind achieves historic new milestone in AI-based protein structure prediction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/embed/#?secret=eTKvQtMm9Q" data-secret="eTKvQtMm9Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Taking a discipline by surprise</h2>
<p>Without going into the whole history of computational proteomics (as much as I&#8217;d like to), we essentially went from distributed brute-force tactics 15 years ago — remember Folding@home? — to more honed processes in the last decade. Then AI-based approaches came on the scene, making a splash in 2019 when DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold leapfrogged every other system in the world — then made another jump in 2020, achieving accuracy levels high enough and reliable enough that it prompted some experts to declare the problem of turning an arbitrary sequence into a 3D structure solved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only compressing this long history into one paragraph because it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">extensively covered at the time</a>, but it&#8217;s hard to overstate how sudden and complete this advance was. This was a problem that stumped the best minds in the world for decades, and it went from &#8220;we maybe have an approach that kind of works, but extremely slowly and at great cost&#8221; to &#8220;accurate, reliable, and can be done with off the shelf computers&#8221; in the space of a year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180805" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180805" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180805" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg" alt="Examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DeepMind</p></div></p>
<p>The specifics of DeepMind&#8217;s advances and how it achieved them I will leave to specialists in the fields of computational biology and proteomics, who will no doubt be picking apart and iterating on this work over the coming months and years. It&#8217;s the practical results that concern us today, as the company employed its time since the publication of AlphaFold 2 (the version shown in 2020) not just tweaking the model, but running it&#8230; on every single protein sequence they could get their hands on.</p>
<p>The result is that 98.5% of the human proteome is now &#8220;folded,&#8221; as they say, meaning there is a predicted structure that the AI model is confident enough (and importantly, <em>we</em> are confident enough in <em>its</em> confidence) represents the real thing. Oh, and they also folded the proteome for 20 other organisms, like yeast and E. coli, amounting to about 350,000 protein structures total. It&#8217;s by far — by orders of magnitude — the largest and best collection of this absolutely crucial information.</p>
<p>All that will be made available as a freely browsable database that any researcher can simply plug a sequence or protein name into and immediately be provided the 3D structure. The details of the process and database can be found in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03828-1">published today in the journal Nature</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The database as you&#8217;ll see it tomorrow, it&#8217;s a search bar, it&#8217;s almost like Google search for protein structures,&#8221; said Hassabis in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;You can view it in the 3D visualizer, zoom around it, interrogate the genetic sequence&#8230; and the nice thing about doing it with EMBL-EBI is it&#8217;s linked to all their other databases. So you can immediately go and see related genes, And it&#8217;s linked to all these other databases, you can see related genes, related in other organisms, other proteins that have related functions, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gk-PyJSNlcI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;As a scientist myself, who works on an almost unfathomable protein,&#8221; said EMBL-EBI&#8217;s Edith Heard (she didn&#8217;t specify which protein), &#8220;it&#8217;s really exciting to know that you can find out what the business end of a protein is now, in such a short time — it would have taken years. So being able to access the structure and say &#8216;aha, <em>this</em> is the business end,&#8217; you can then focus on trying to work out what that business end does. And I think this is accelerating science by steps of years, a bit like being able to sequence genomes did decades ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>So new is the very idea of being able to do this that Hassabis said he fully expects the entire field to change — and change the database along with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Structural biologists are not yet used to the idea that they can just look up anything in a matter of seconds, rather than take years to experimentally determine these things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think that should lead to whole new types of approaches to questions that can be asked and experiments that can be done. Once we start getting wind of that, we may start building other tools that cater to this sort of serendipity: What if I want to look at 10,000 proteins related in a particular way? There isn&#8217;t really a normal way of doing that, because that isn&#8217;t really a normal question anyone would ask currently. So I imagine we&#8217;ll have to start producing new tools, and there&#8217;ll be demand for that once we start seeing how people interact with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>That includes derivative and incrementally improved versions of the software itself, which has been released in open source along with a great deal of development history. Already we have seen an independently developed system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/researchers-match-deepminds-alphafold2-protein-folding-power-with-faster-freely-available-model/">RoseTTAFold</a>, from researchers at the University of Washington&#8217;s Baker Lab, which extrapolated from AlphaFold&#8217;s performance last year to create something similar yet more efficient — though DeepMind seems to have taken the lead again with its latest version. But the point was made that the secret sauce is out there for all to use.</p>

<h2>Practical magic</h2>
<p>Although the prospect of structural bioinformaticians attaining their fondest dreams is heartwarming, it is important to note that there are in fact immediate and real benefits to the work DeepMind and EMBL-EBI have done. It is perhaps easiest to see in their partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Institute.</p>
<p>The DNDI focuses, as you might guess, on diseases that are rare enough that they don&#8217;t warrant the kind of attention and investment from major pharmaceutical companies and medical research outfits that would potentially result in discovering a treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very practical problem in clinical genetics, where you have a suspected series of mutations, of changes in an affected child, and you want to try and work out which one is likely to be the reason why our child has got a particular genetic disease. And having widespread structural information, I am almost certain will improve the way we can do that,&#8221; said DNDI&#8217;s Ewan Birney in a press call ahead of the release.</p>
<p>Ordinarily examining the proteins suspected of being at the root of a given problem would be expensive and time-consuming, and for diseases that affect relatively few people, money and time are in short supply when they can be applied to more common problems like cancers or dementia-related diseases. But being able to simply call up the structures of 10 healthy proteins and 10 mutated versions of the same, insights may appear in <em>seconds</em> that might otherwise have taken years of painstaking experimental work. (The drug discovery and testing process still takes years, but maybe now it can start tomorrow for Chagas disease instead of in 2025.)</p>

<p>Lest you think too much is resting on a computer&#8217;s prediction of experimentally unverified results, in another, totally different case, some of the painstaking work had already been done. <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-groups/centre-for-enzyme-innovation">John McGeehan of the University of Portsmouth</a>, with whom DeepMind partnered for another potential use case, explained how this affected his team&#8217;s work on plastic decomposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first sent our seven sequences to the DeepMind team, for two of those we already had experimental structures. So we were able to test those when they came back, and it was one of those moments, to be honest, when the hairs stood up on the back of my neck,&#8221; said McGeehan. &#8220;Because the structures that they produced were identical to our crystal structures. In fact, they contained even more information than the crystal structures were able to provide in certain cases. We were able to use that information directly to develop faster enzymes for breaking down plastics. And those experiments are already underway, immediately. So the acceleration to our project here is, I would say, multiple years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to, over the next year or two, make predictions for every single known and sequenced protein — somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred million. And for the most part (the few structures not susceptible to this approach seem to make themselves known quickly) biologists should be able to have great confidence in the results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180807" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180807" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180807" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="570" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg 1882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=1536,855 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-inspect.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180807" class="wp-caption-text">Inspecting molecular structure in 3D has been possible for decades, but finding that structure in the first place is difficult. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> DeepMind</p></div></p>
<p>The process AlphaFold uses to predict structures is, in some cases, better than experimental options. And although there is an amount of uncertainty in how any AI model achieves its results, Hassabis was clear that this is not just a black box.</p>
<p>&#8220;For this particular case, I think explainability was not just a nice-to-have, which often is the case in machine learning, but it was a must-have, given the seriousness of what we wanted it to be used for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I think we&#8217;ve done the most we&#8217;ve ever done on a particular system to make the case with explainability. So there&#8217;s both explainability on a granular level on the algorithm, and then explainability in terms of the outputs, as well the predictions and the structures, and how much you should or shouldn&#8217;t trust them, and which of the regions are the reliable areas of prediction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his description of the system as &#8220;miraculous&#8221; attracted my special sense for potential headline words. Hassabis said that there&#8217;s nothing miraculous about the process itself, but rather that he&#8217;s a bit amazed that all their work has produced something so powerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was by far the hardest project we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And, you know, even when we know every detail of how the code works, and the system works, and we can see all the outputs, it&#8217;s still just still a bit miraculous when you see what it&#8217;s doing&#8230; that it&#8217;s taking this, this 1D amino acid chain and creating these beautiful 3D structures, a lot of them aesthetically incredibly beautiful, as well as scientifically and functionally valuable. So it was more a statement of a sort of wonder.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fold after fold</h2>
<p>The impact of AlphaFold and the proteome database won&#8217;t be felt for some time at large, but it will almost certainly — as early partners have testified — lead to some serious short-term and long-term breakthroughs. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the mystery of the proteome is solved completely. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>As noted above, the complexity of the genome is nothing compared to that of the proteome at a fundamental level, but even with this major advance we have only scratched the surface of the latter. AlphaFold solves a very specific, though very important problem: given a sequence of amino acids, predict the 3D shape that sequence takes in reality. But proteins don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; they&#8217;re part of a complex, dynamic system in which they are changing their conformation, being broken up and reformed, responding to conditions, the presence of elements or other proteins, and indeed then reshaping themselves around <em>those</em>.</p>
<p>In fact a great deal of the human proteins for which AlphaFold gave only a middling level of confidence to its predictions may be fundamentally &#8220;disordered&#8221; proteins that are too variable to pin down the way a more static one can be (in which case the prediction would be validated as a highly accurate predictor for that type of protein). So the team has its work cut out for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to start looking at new problems,&#8221; said Hassabis. &#8220;Of course, there are many, many new challenges. But the ones you mentioned, protein interaction, protein complexes, ligand binding, we&#8217;re working actually on all these things, and we have early, early stage projects on all those topics. But I do think it&#8217;s worth taking, you know, a moment to just talk about delivering this big step&#8230; it&#8217;s something that the computational biology community&#8217;s been working on for 20, 30 years, and I do think we have now broken the back of that problem.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["You may think that the message is boring because you've said it once. But repetition never spoils the prayer."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Caryn Marooney, Silicon Valley communications professional turned venture capitalist, spoke extensively on storytelling at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising. During her talk, she broke down messaging into four critical parts.</p>
<p>Marooney knows what she&#8217;s talking about: Throughout her time in Silicon Valley, she helped companies like Salesforce, Amazon, Facebook and more launch products and maintain messaging. In 2019, she left Facebook, where she was VP of technology communication, and joined Coatue Management as a general partner.</p>
<p>The presentation is summarized below and lightly edited for readability. Marooney breaks down her method into the acronym of RIBS: Relevance, Inevitability, Believability and keeping it Simple. A video of her presentation is also embedded below and contains 20 minutes of Q&amp;A where she answers audience questions and covers a lot of ground.</p>
<p>Marooney has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/caryn-marooney/">written extensively on this subject for TechCrunch,</a> including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">this article,</a> where she describes her RIBS method in detail. Last month, she expanded on this topic with her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/the-hamburger-model-is-a-winning-go-to-market-strategy/">go-to-market strategy around building a hamburger</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8216;The gift of editing is critical. Do not just write all your ideas and get very excited about what you think and ship it.&#8217;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Relevant</h2>
<p>Why should anyone care? Does anyone care? That&#8217;s the point Marooney is making here. The message must be relevant to the audience before anything else.</p>
<blockquote><p>The very first thing is why anyone should care. And it&#8217;s important to remember that as a startup, you&#8217;re in a situation where nobody knows you. And nobody thinks, &#8220;Oh, I should really care about this. So you need to be very specific about who your audiences are and why they should care and why it matters to them. Early on, too. Relevance is usually to a very small audience, and you earn the right every day to expand that audience.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I was first working with Salesforce, it was a very narrow set of salespeople, for small- and medium-sized businesses, there was always the sense that it was going to be a cloud provider for companies of every size, but you have to start somewhere. And when you&#8217;re starting somewhere, you can paint the bigger picture. But you have to be specific about the benefits to your smaller audience. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 1:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Inevitable</h2>
<p>In addition to talking about Tesla, Marooney uses the counter-example of the Segway, which shows a great idea alone is not enough. Even though Segways were introduced as a world-changing mode of transportation, in 2021, Segways are mainly only used by mall cops and tourists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a couple of generations of wireless earbuds under its belt, OnePlus finally has the AirPods Pro &#8212; and the rest of the premium market &#8212; in its sights. As part of an event today that also includes the launch of its budget Nord 2, the company officially announced the OnePlus Buds Pro.</p>
<p>The top-line feature here is adaptive noise canceling, which uses a trio of on-board mics to filter out ambient sound up to 40 dBs. The company says the tech compares favorably to more standard active noise cancelling, which offers a set level of filtering. The buds are powered by a pair of 11mm dynamic drivers, with support for Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>All told, battery life is up to 10 hours on the buds (sans noise cancelling) and 38 with the case (ditto). The case will charge wireless with third-party Qi pads, or the system can get 10 hours of life with 10 minutes plugged in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180164" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180164" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180164" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180164" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>At $150, they’re $100 cheaper than the AirPods, though the number everyone is looking at here is almost certainly the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">$99 price tag Nothing announced</a> for its upcoming Ear (1) buds. OnePlus did manage, however, to beat its co-founder’s new company to the punch by a full week.</p>
<p>Coincidence? You be the judge. (Honestly, it&#8217;s probably a coincide, given that the Ear (1) were delayed, but I digress.)</p>
<p>The price tag puts them more directly in line with the recently announced Beats Studio Buds, along with Google&#8217;s Pixel Buds and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Buds Pro &#8212; that is to say, somewhere in the middle of the pack. Design-wise, they appear most similar to the AirPods Pro, albeit with a metallic stem popping out from the bottom of the black or white buds.</p>
<p>I was fairly underwhelmed by the company&#8217;s first fully wireless set, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/oneplus-fully-wireless-earbuds/">the OnePlus Buds</a>. To the company&#8217;s credit, they were extremely aggressively priced, at $70, in keeping with the release of the original Nord handset. The OnePlus Buds Pro will arrive in the U.S. and Canada on September 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/braintrace">Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Braintrace, which was founded in 2016 and has raised $10 million in funding, has developed a network detection and response (NDR) solution that helps organizations to easily inspect network traffic to identify and filter out suspicious activity. It does this using remote network packet capture (RNCAP) technology, which provides visibility into network traffic patterns, including encrypted traffic, without the need for man-in-the-middle decryption. It also provides visibility into cloud network traffic, a task that typically needs to be carried out on-site, and supports all of the major cloud providers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft-azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will see Sophos integrate Braintrace’s NDR technology into its own adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, which underpins all of its security products and services. The technology will also help Sophos collect data from firewalls, proxies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>, allowing it to look for network traffic that contains instructions for malware like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/trickerbot-malware-tax-day/">TrickBot</a>, and attackers that misuse Cobalt Strike, as well as pre-empting other malicious traffic that might lead to ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>Braintrace’s developers, data scientists and security analysts have joined its global Sophos&#8217; managed threat response (MTR) and rapid response teams as part of the deal.</p>

<p>Commenting on the deal, which Sophos claims will make it one of the largest and fastest-growing managed detection and response (MDR) providers, the company&#8217;s CEO Joe Levy said: “We’re excited that Braintrace built this technology specifically to provide better security outcomes to their MDR customers. It’s hard to beat the effectiveness of solutions built by teams of skilled practitioners and developers to solve real-world cybersecurity problems.”</p>
<p>Bret Laughlin, co-founder and CEO of Braintrace, added: &#8220;We built Braintrace’s NDR technology from the ground up for detection and now, with Sophos, it will fit into a complete system to provide cross-product detection and response across a multi-vendor ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The deal comes a little over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos</a>, and sees the private equity firm further increasing its reach in the cybersecurity space.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify announced this morning a new partnership with online GIF database GIPHY to enable discovery of new music through GIFs. No, the GIFs themselves won&#8217;t play song clips, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking. Instead, through a series of new Spotify-linked GIFs, there will be an option to click a button to be taken to Spotify directly to hear the artist&#8217;s music. At launch, artists including <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDR16INL7zhKuyA7_grltZ9KP9DQ">Doja Cat</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/theweeknd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/theweeknd&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF85_9RxUrSmFIl39NRHkQUlHUmlA">The Weeknd</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/postmalone" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/postmalone&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1u97eHxUnxYzqU_RGSXFpOXybBg">Post Malone</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/nickiminaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/nickiminaj&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMie9S4PVq8bEJnEpg7rEIYHDO-g">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9DKCd1LBzTTqPWm7EMBrW6HR4hQ">The Kid LAROI</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/conangray" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/conangray&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5h93zFlIqbYetV2tstiEc96ckag">Conan Gray</a> and others will have Spotify-linked GIFs available on their official GIPHY profile page. More artists will be added over time.</p>
<p>The idea behind the new integration is to help connect users with Spotify music from their everyday communications, like texts, group chats and other places where GIFs are used. This is similar to Spotify&#8217;s existing integrations with social media apps like <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-09-09/share-what-youre-listening-to-on-spotify-with-snapchat/">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8430172/spotify-instagram-stories-users-share-what-listening-to">Instagram</a>, where users can share music through the Stories and messages they post. Essentially, it&#8217;s a user acquisition strategy that leverages online social activities &#8212; in this case, sharing GIFs &#8212; while also benefiting the artists through the exposure they receive.</p>
<p>You can find the new Spotify-linked GIFs on the artist&#8217;s page on GIPHY.com or through GIPHY&#8217;s mobile app. The supported GIFs will include a new &#8220;Listen on Spotify&#8221; button at the bottom which will appear alongside the GIF when it&#8217;s shared. When clicked, users are redirected from the GIF to the artist&#8217;s page on Spotify, where they can stream their music or browse to discover more songs they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180912" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180912" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180912" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mobile-promo_doja.gif?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180912" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/GIPHY</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify says the feature is part of a broader partnership it has with GIPHY, which will later focus on bringing a more interactive listening experience to users.</p>
<p>The move to partner with GIPHY follows a recent expansion of the existing partnership between Spotify and GIPHY&#8217;s parent company, Facebook. The social networking giant bought the popular GIF platform in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">a deal worth a reported $400 million</a> back in 2020, a couple years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Google snatched up GIPHY rival, Tenor</a>. Since then, Facebook has worked to better integrate GIPHY with its apps, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/spotify-adds-timestamped-podcast-sharing-and-other-social-features/"> Facebook and Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook and Spotify had also teamed up<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/"> on a new &#8220;Boombox&#8221; project</a> that allows Facebook users to listen to music hosted on Spotify while browsing the Facebook app. This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">powered by a &#8220;miniplayer&#8221;</a> that allows anyone who comes across the shared music to click to play the content while they scroll their feed.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-22/elevate-your-gif-game-with-giphy-and-spotifys-new-music-feature/">says</a> the new feature will be available to users globally from verified GIPHY artists&#8217; pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More doesn’t necessarily mean better &#8212; and that’s a lesson for life and for tech. To focus on the latter, the startup ecosystem is experiencing a boggling influx of capital right now. However, the increase in dollars isn’t being evenly distributed to all founders. For the vast majority of people, especially women and nonbinary entrepreneurs, it’s still hard to raise money &#8212; and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">perhaps even harder than before the pandemic. </a></p>
<p>All Raise, a nonprofit that has for years worked to advance women and nonbinary folks within tech, has been watching closely the dip in funding for female and nonbinary founders. Per VP of Marketing Caroline Caswell, while pockets of progress do exist, funding for female founders is still “lukewarm.” She noted how in the first half of this year, 1.6% of venture capital went to female founders, down 30% from 2.3% in 2020, which was already a dip from the year prior, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">per PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>“The narrative that ‘VC is back?’ ” Caswell said. “It is back for the same people as it was before.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The misconception that the hot-deal summer is benefitting everyone has given All Raise some urgency to launch a new product for women and nonbinary founders, which it’s announcing today.</p>
<p>The nonprofit is <a href="https://allraise.org/masterclasses ">releasing a series of master classes</a> meant to give an inside glimpse at raising first institutional rounds and scaling companies. The material, which includes pre-recorded sessions from All Raise’s in-person Founder Bootcamp, will be free to access for anyone interested.</p>
<p>Instructors include checkwriters such as Cowboy Ventures’ Aileen Lee and Benchmark Capital’s Sarah Tavel, as well as seasoned executives like Figma’s VP of Communications Nairi Hourdajian and Solv Health co-founder and CEO Heather Fernandez. All Raise said that it did not track ethnicity or racial data of its instructors, however it did offer a breakdown of the 400 beta users who tested the master class series.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180750 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png" alt="" width="828" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png 2668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=2048,1084 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<div>Users&#8217; self-reported data shows that the largest concentration &#8212; 39% &#8212; of users are White, while 11% are African-American/Black and 6% are Latinx and Hispanic. Most users don&#8217;t identify as white.</div>
<p>There’s constantly a disconnect between tactical content on how to fundraise and true access to capital; tips don’t necessarily lead to a closed check, which leaves some founders skeptical of yet another launch of resources.</p>
<p>That said, Caswell says that the master classes are trying to move beyond the “typical Sandhill Road Medium post” or Twitter threads, and thinks that the explicitness and real-world examples could serve as an empowering tool to founders.</p>
<p>Topics range from basics like how to prepare for your Series A to more nuanced thoughts like the emotions of fundraising, and how to say goodbye to a team. The programming is meant to be a more intimate look at early-stage tech, beyond what you’d find on a Twitter thread, Caswell explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180749" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180749" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180749" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png" alt="All Raise seed curriculum" width="859" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png 2666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=680,313 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=1536,708 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=2048,943 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180749" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> All Raise</p></div></p>
<p>“When it comes to resources and insight for typically underrepresented founders, more is more is more,” she added. Lessons range between three to 60 minutes, and amount to some 15 hours of content.</p>
<p>The structure of All Raise’s master classes looks similar in format to what Y Combinator offers in its free series Startup School, which includes some <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library?query=female%20founder">light content</a> specifically targeted toward female founders. Long-term, it’d be interesting to see how All Raise refreshes material to work more for online learning, as it already has an engaged community that it could easily turn into a living, breathing class that filters through the nonprofit&#8217;s other tools.</p>

How can business, government, philanthropy, and the startup community come together to create a better tomorrow? Hear from these industry veterans and thought leaders about how technology can not only shape the future, but also where the biggest opportunities lie, including some exciting news about XTC and the FAO of the United Nations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Cutting Out Carbon Emitters with Bioengineering:</strong> Bioengineering may soon provide compelling, low-carbon alternatives in industries where even the best methods produce significant emissions. By utilizing natural and engineered biological processes, we may soon have low-carbon textiles from Algiknit, lab-grown premium meats from Orbillion and fuels captured from waste emissions via LanzaTech. Leaders from these companies will join our panel to talk about how bioengineering can do its part in the fight against climate change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has acquired identity and access management (IAM) startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudknox-security-inc">CloudKnox Security</a>, the tech giant&#8217;s fourth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> acquisition this year.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, is the latest cybersecurity acquisition by Microsoft, which just last week announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">it’s buying threat intelligence startup RiskIQ</a>. The firm also recently acquired IoT security startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/microsoft-confirms-acquisition-of-cyberx-to-boost-security-in-its-iot-business/">CyberX</a> and Refirm Labs as it moved to beef up its security portfolio. Security is big business for Microsoft, which made more than $10 billion in security-related revenue in 2020 — a 40% increase from the year prior.</p>
<p>CloudKnox, which was founded in 2015 and emerged from stealth two years later, helps organizations enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk and help prevent security breaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The startup had raised $22.8 million prior to the acquisition, with backing from ClearSky, Sorenson Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital and Foundation Capital. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s activity-based authorization service will equip Azure Active Directory customers with “granular visibility, continuous monitoring and automated remediation for hybrid and multi-cloud permissions,” according to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/21/microsoft-acquires-cloudknox-security-to-offer-unified-privileged-access-and-cloud-entitlement-management/">a blog post</a> by Joy Chik, corporate vice president of identity at Microsoft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chik said that while organizations were reaping the benefits of cloud adoption, particularly as they embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">flexible working models</a>, they often struggled to assess, prevent and enforce privileged access across hybrid and multicloud environments.</p>

<p>“CloudKnox offers complete visibility into privileged access,” Chik said. “It helps organizations right-size permissions and consistently enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk, and it employs continuous analytics to help prevent security breaches and ensure compliance. This strengthens our comprehensive approach to cloud security.”</p>
<p>In addition to Azure Active Directory, Microsoft also plans to integrate CloudKnox with its other cloud security services, including 365 Defender, Azure Defender and Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Balaji Parimi, CloudKnox founder and CEO, said: “By joining Microsoft, we can unlock new synergies and make it easier for our mutual customers to protect their multi-cloud and hybrid environments and strengthen their security posture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber Freight, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, has acquired Transplace for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital, according to regulatory filings. The deal announced Thursday will involve $750 million in Uber stock with the remainder in cash.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Transplace marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant step forward, not just for Uber Freight but for the entire logistics ecosystem,&#8221; Lior Ron, head of Uber Freight, said in a statement. &#8220;This is an opportunity to bring together complementary best-in-class technology solutions and operational excellence from two premier companies to create an industry-first shipper-to-carrier platform that will transform shippers&#8217; entire supply chains, delivering operational resilience and reducing costs at a time when it matters most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transplace CEO Frank McGuigan said as a result, the combined company expects shippers will see greater efficiency and transparency. &#8220;All in all, we expect to significantly reduce shipper and carrier empty miles to the benefit of highway and road infrastructures and the environment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Uber Freight launched in 2017. In August 2018, it was spun off into a separate business unit, a move that simultaneously allowed it to gain momentum and burn more cash. After spinning off of Uber, the freight company underwent an expansion. Uber Freight redesigned its app, an improvement that included adding new navigation features to make searching for and filtering loads easier to customize.</p>
<p>The company expanded to Canada and Europe. Uber Freight also established a headquarters in Chicago as part of its parent company&#8217;s broader plan to invest more than $200 million annually in the region, including hiring hundreds of workers. Uber said in September 2019 it would hire 2,000 new employees in the region over the next three years; most would be dedicated to Uber Freight.</p>
<p>Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">sold a stake</a> in the freight business last year when investor group led by New York-based investment firm Greenbriar Equity Group committed to invest $500 million in a Series A preferred stock financing for the business. The deal valued the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>Uber maintained majority ownership in Uber Freight and used the funds gained from Greenbriar to continue to scale its logistics platform, which helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conventional wisdom holds that one ought let sleeping does lie. But no one says you&#8217;re barred from tracking them while they do. New York-based smart collar maker Fi announced today that it’s adding sleep to the list of the device’s tracking.</p>
<p>The added feature uses the collar’s on-board motion sensing to monitor your best friend’s sleep during the day and night (and almost certainly leave you jealous about how much shut-eye they’re getting).</p>
<p>The information is presented on a timeline that should look familiar to anyone who has used the human equivalent. It also offers a live check-in to see what the dog is up to during the day while you’re at work (assuming you ever go back to the office).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180800" style="width: 722px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180800" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png" alt="" width="712" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fi</p></div></p>
<p>The goal here is to offer up some sharable metrics about your pet that might point to underlying health problems, be it too much sleep, not enough or frequent trips to the water bowl in the middle of the night. Sudden changes also present potential red flags for the dog’s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to move into holistic health tracking that empowers dog parents to take the best possible care of their pets,” founder and CEO Jonathan Bensamoun said in a release. “If your dog is tired, it can’t tell you, so Fi will. Fi can answer critical questions like, ‘Is my pet sleeping the right way?’ or ‘Did its activity levels decrease lately?’ long before more serious issues have time to develop.”</p>
<p>Fi raised $30 million back in February and is working to grow its reach in the U.S., including a recent distribution deal with mega-online pet supply seller, Chewy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you can&#8217;t say it with words, say it with an emoji. Facebook is announcing a few minor updates today to its Messenger platform, which make it easier than ever to find the exact emoji you&#8217;re looking for when reacting to a friend&#8217;s message (let&#8217;s be real, there&#8217;s a big difference between the &#8220;crying laughing&#8221; and &#8220;crying&#8221; emoji). This includes a search bar for emoji reactions, and a recently used emojis section. And, if you weren&#8217;t let down by the long-awaited &#8220;Space Jam&#8221; sequel, you can sport your love for hoopster Bugs Bunny with a &#8220;Space Jam 2&#8221; chat theme, available both on Messenger and in Instagram DMs. Don&#8217;t get too excited though &#8212; even though this theme sets a basketball as the chat&#8217;s emoji, the long-lost, beloved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/facebook-sneaked-a-seriously-addictive-basketball-game-into-messenger/">basketball mini game</a> has not yet made its triumphant return to the Messenger app.</p>

And as live audio has become ever-present &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">Twitter Spaces</a>, to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a> &#8212; why not add audio to emojis?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, Messenger debuted Soundmojis, which are what they sound like &#8212; emojis with sounds. On the Messenger app, you can use Soundmojis by clicking the smiley face icon in the chat box, which opens up the expressions menu. When you select the loudspeaker icon, you can select from just under 30 standard emojis, but when you click on them, they play sounds, including &#8220;Brooklyn 99&#8221; quotes, Olivia Rodrigo clips and lines from &#8220;Bridgerton.&#8221; The &#8220;X&#8221; emoji plays &#8220;Oh No&#8221; by Capone, a song that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/capone-oh-no-tiktok-trend">went viral</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>According to Facebook Messenger, people send more than 2.4 billion messages with emojis on the platform each day. That&#8217;s great and all, but if we can tap the car emoji to hear sounds from &#8220;Fast &amp; Furious,&#8221; when will we be able to tap the soccer emoji to play &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/how-to-play-facebook-messengers-new-super-addictive-and-hidden-soccer-game/">keepie uppie</a>&#8221; again?</p>
