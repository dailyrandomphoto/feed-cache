										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vimeo</a>, the B2B video platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/what-vimeos-growth-profits-and-value-tell-us-about-the-online-video-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out from IAC earlier this year</a>, has made a pair of acquisitions aimed at building out the suite of features and tools it offers to businesses to create and run their own video strategies. The company has picked up short-form AI-based video creation platform <a href="https://www.wibbitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wibbitz</a>; and <a href="https://www.wirewax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wirewax</a>, which has built technology for marketers and other non-technical creatives to make objects in videos &#8220;shoppable&#8221; or linkable to other outside content.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed, but for some context, New York-based Wibbitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/wibbitz-raises-2-3m-series-a-for-technology-that-turns-text-into-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally made its name</a> as an Israeli startup that had built AI-based technology that automatically turned text into videos, a service that helped it raise around $30 million from investors that included a number of strategic backers (that is, customers) like the Associated Press, Bertelsmann, France&#8217;s TF1, and the Weather Channel, as well as traditional VCs like Horizons Ventures and Kima Ventures. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/video-taggging-startup-wirewax-makes-cougar-town-episode-shoppable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London-based Wirewax</a>, meanwhile, also had a strategic backer in the form of the BBC, and other investors included Passion Capital and the Plug and Play incubator. It had raised around $7 million. Both have large customers on their books.</p>
<p>Vimeo plans to keep both platforms operational and continue serving existing customers, which include the likes of Walmart, Disney, Google, and Nike for Wirewax and HubSpot, Bloomberg, Cond√© Nast, and Harvard University for Wibbitz. It is also planning to integrate its features into its wider video creation dashboard to over time sell a wider set of tools both to those customers and those already with Vimeo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231959" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The idea behind the deals is to bring in more tools specifically targeting Vimeo&#8217;s larger enterprise customers, CEO Anjali Sud said in an interview, to provide more creative tools that are less technical to help them feed the video beast: video consumption has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1215173/impact-of-covid-19-on-type-of-video-consumption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed</a> in the last couple of years, fueled in no small part by Covid-19 and people spending more time at home and on their screens rather than in public places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s accelerated a lot of organizations&#8217; video strategies, whether that involves providing tools for internal teams to get work done, or creating marketing campaigns, or building new products themselves.</p>
<p class="p17">&#8220;Companies are going from reactive to proactive, and employees are demanding it,&#8221; Sud said of the video push and how its customers are looking for more functionality in their video software. The knock-on effect for Vimeo, she added, has been to become a consolidator of many of the smaller video companies that have emerged over the years to address different aspects of the creation process, to make a bigger product that is easier to address that demand, with &#8220;several acquisitions helpful in expanding our product suite to create an all-in-one professional video solution. Our belief is that every startup has an interesting video feature to provide. We want to get every company using video every day, to get 1 billion knowledge workers using video. To do that you have to materially lower the barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p17">It&#8217;s been a years-long strategy for the company, with other acquisitions including the purchase of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/vimeo-acquires-livestream-launches-its-own-live-video-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Livestream</a>, which it says now powers town halls and other live events (a platform that was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vimeo-launches-vimeo-events-a-new-platform-designed-to-turn-every-marketer-into-a-virtual-events-pro-301413693.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded</a> earlier this month by way of a new virtual events product); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/vimeo-has-acquired-short-form-video-creation-platform-magisto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magisto</a>, another short-form video creator tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wirewax will be bringing more interactive video functionality to Vimeo, specifically with a drag-and-drop interface. One of the most obvious applications will be in the realm of e-commerce where users will be able to use the tech to build &#8220;shoppable&#8221; videos with links within the videos themselves to buying featured items; but other applications can be technical (eg to product demonstrations) or education (for further information about something in a video), or internal training for employees (for example links through to quizzes).</p>
<p>Wibbitz, meanwhile, is more focused on video creation, and specifically tools for marketing, internal communications and media teams to manage large amounts of video while keeping the content consistent with company branding and style. It also still offers a product for using AI to transform text to video automatically, although this is no longer the core service. Sud said that AI IP will be integrated into its existing products that also provide the same functionality (which it acquired via Magisto).</p>
<p class="p6">&#8220;Wirewax was built for the video-first future, evolving video to be a lean-in, fully engaging experience,‚Äù said Steve Callanan, CEO, Wirewax, in a statement. ‚ÄúMarrying Wirewax with Vimeo‚Äôs video leadership and global scale will put the power of next-generation interactive video into the hands of millions of users. It‚Äôs an exciting step to be joining Vimeo and contributing to helping organizations unleash their creativity and produce engaging experiences that drive better business outcomes, from shoppable videos to boost sales, to entirely new ways to improve training, education, and customer service.‚Äù</p>
<p class="p6">‚ÄúWibbitz and Vimeo have a shared goal of making video creation so simple that any employee can easily and quickly make beautiful, professional-quality videos at scale,‚Äù added Zohar Dayan, CEO, Wibbitz. ‚ÄúWe have spent over 10 years honing our product to serve marketing, HR, and communications teams at some of the largest companies in the world, and are thrilled to join Vimeo‚Äôs world-class platform to accelerate the video transformation taking place across the enterprise.‚Äù</p>
<p>The pair of acquisitions nevertheless come on the heels of a mixed year for Vimeo. The company spun out as a public company from IAC in May, debuting at $57/share. However, it saw its stock dip on its first day of trading ending up with a market cap of $8.4 billion on its closing day. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VMEO?p=VMEO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today</a>, its share price and valuation are more than halved, with a market cap of $4 billion. Some of the skepticism in the market appears to hinge on the fact that it&#8217;s spinning out into what has become a highly competitive space, with many a company with deep pockets also looking to address the same gap in the market for providing video services to businesses that want to do more in video.</p>
<p>Despite this, the fact remains that we have seen record-breaking levels for all kinds of video providers, from on-demand premium content companies like Netflix through to those focused as well on user-generated content like TikTok and YouTube, and those with more business focus, such as Zoom for conferencing.</p>
<p>That rising tide has also lifted 10-year-old Vimeo&#8217;s boat. The company posted quarterly revenues of $100 million in Q3 (it debuted in May with quarter revenues of $89.4 million). Sud tells us that the company now has &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of free users and 1.6 million paying users (that latter figure is flat compared to May, when Vimeo disclosed 200 million free users).</p>
<p>Since its pivot to B2B four years ago, Vimeo&#8217;s customer base has settled on a pretty wide mix, ranging from SMBs through to startups and some 6,000 large enterprises including Starbucks, Amazon and Spotify. Enterprise revenues grew 60% in the last quarter compared to a year ago, figures that the company is holding in place as it looks to the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think in the long term of decades, not years,&#8221; Sud said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canary‚Äôs first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and the firm's expectation is to do around the same number of first checks with the third fund.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.canary.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canary</a>, the Brazilian venture capital firm backing some of Latin America‚Äôs successful startups like Buser, Salve, Hashdex, Facily and Trybe, closed on its third fund that was oversubscribed with $100 million in commitments.</p>
<p>Since its formation in 2017, the firm invested in more than 100 companies in Latin America through its first two funds, on which it raised $45 million and $75 million, respectively. Those startups have in turn raised over $2.3 billion in new investments.</p>
<p>Marcos Toledo, Canary‚Äôs co-founder and managing partner, started the firm with Florian Hagenbuch, Mate Pencz, Patrick de Picciotto and Julio Vasconcellos. It is agnostic in terms of sector and aims to be a local partner for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/">U.S. firms seeking investments in the area</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Toledo expects to invest in about 50 companies, and first checks from the fund were signed starting in the summer.</p>
<p>We emailed with Toledo recently to learn more about the fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long do you usually wait between new raises?</strong></p>
<p>MT: We normally raise a new vintage after two or two-and-a-half years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was now a good time to launch a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>Launching a new fund right now is a reinforcement of the potential of the region for innovation and our vision of the future: still lots of problems to be solved, paired with a growing pool of talented people starting or joining new companies.</p>
<p>When Canary was founded, in 2017, it was founded under the hypothesis that there are plenty of talented people that, with the right support and incentives, could create businesses with huge impact, capable of changing Latin America. We thought the tech market in the region was in its early stages and had many opportunities.</p>
<p>A few years later, we are not only happy to see that our belief was right, but also that this trend is accelerating, with more and more people making a shift in their careers, becoming founders or joining a startup team, instead of going to work in traditional jobs (for instance, our second vintage had 50% more second time founders than the first one, and this number seems to be higher for the new vintage).</p>
<p>In addition to that, we are very excited about our positioning in the market, having access to more than 90% of all funding rounds that have happened in Brazil since 2017. Moreover, the VC market is still in its early days in Latin America and there are plenty of structural problems and industries waiting to be disrupted in the region, something that excites us about the transformation to come in the next few years. There is a true opportunity to consolidate ourselves as one of the main VC firms in the region.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tuna raises $3M to address complexity of e-commerce payments in Latin America&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/tuna-raises-3m-to-address-complexity-of-e-commerce-payments-in-latin-america/embed/#?secret=Rb5RjEpayc" data-secret="Rb5RjEpayc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>What was it like raising a fund in this environment?</strong></p>
<p>More than just raising capital, in Canary we seek to have, as investors, long-term oriented partners that can add real value to our invested companies. In this third fund, we are excited to say that not only we were heavily oversubscribed, but also fortunate to renew the partnerships with some leading Brazilian and global families, several partners of renowned global funds, as well as a large proportion of the best tech founders in the region.</p>
<p>We also had the chance to expand our investor base across geographies, such as Asia, LatAm and the U.S., and to different pools of capital, such as U.S. endowments and foundations. Cases of success in the region are helping more and more investors to understand the market and see the potential of really big companies to be created around here. Moreover, the push for digital transformation and disruption in Latin America is each and every day making our hypothesis stronger.</p>

<p><strong>Where will the new fund be targeted?</strong></p>
<p>As in Canary‚Äôs two first funds, this third fund is focused on writing the first institutional check for the best founders in Latin America. We always saw the opportunity for the whole region, but decided to start with Brazil. Now, we are increasingly investing in companies all over the continent, from countries like Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.</p>
<p>Considering sectors, we maintain our agnostic approach: we believe that excellent founders will always find a way to look at the best opportunities and build amazing companies. As we often say, we are not experts in sectors, but we are specialists in finding talented people with ambition to transform the lives of millions of Latin Americans. More than that, we are also focused on helping these founders in areas that can unlock disproportionate value, like fundraising, building their founding teams, commercial connections, public relations and data insights. Our focus is basically on people, first checks and LatAm.</p>
<p>Canary‚Äôs first two funds each invested in approximately 50 companies and our expectation is to do around the same number of first checks. We also have a share of the capital reserved to participate in subsequent rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a particular sector where you are seeing a lot of startups coming into or raising funds</strong>?</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to get a first look in the market, and since 2017, we have had access to 93% of the deals that were invested by top-tier VC funds in Brazil. Of course, fintech has been a major sector for LatAm startups in recent years and we see that there are a lot of opportunities still available to be explored by bold and ambitious founders.</p>
<p>In Brazil, specifically, we are also seeing a very interesting moment regarding insurtechs, with local regulators not only approving, but also pushing for more innovation in the market. Healthtech is also rising up in the region ‚Äî the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call about how the health industry is structured and how it can be transformed for better.</p>
<p>Also, as an effect of the pandemic, we are seeing plenty of startups transforming e-commerce and working to make its infrastructure better, from payments to logistics, not without mentioning social commerce companies.</p>
<p>Another enthusiastic opportunity we are seeing are B2B marketplaces that can transform whole industries from the inside. It is a major global trend that is increasingly growing in the region.</p>
<p><strong>What is the investment landscape like in Brazil/Latin America right now? How has it changed in the past 12 months? What do you predict for the next 12 months?</strong></p>
<p>The investment landscape in LatAm is very accelerated right now, a surprise if you consider our perspective about 18 months ago, when COVID hit the region. 2020 and 2021 are record years for VC investments in Latin America, with new but not surprising factors. We are seeing more and more global VC firms writing their first checks in the region (and we are proud to be local partners in the early stage for firms like Dragoneer, a16z, SoftBank, QED and Ribbit).</p>
<p>We are also seeing a first wave of companies doing their IPOs and completing the investment cycle: exits and distributions of stock options do not only bring more money to the table, but also work as success cases and can influence the future of the market and bring more talented people to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>There will also be a lot of experienced executives and operators thinking about their next steps, and this is a positive cycle that can be repeated with different companies going to the public market. Moreover, we are also seeing other countries in LatAm maturing their ecosystems at a faster pace, with plenty of talented people starting new businesses and looking to solve significant problems for the whole continent.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[General Atlantic saw a record 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.generalatlantic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Atlantic</a> announced Wednesday that its sixth growth equity fund, GA 2021, closed with $7.8 billion in commitments, up from the $5 billion the firm was originally seeking earlier this year.</p>
<p>Backers in the new fund included new and existing capital partners, including family offices, endowments, foundations and institutional investors.</p>
<p>GA, which was started in 1980, now has $23.8 billion in committed capital and had over $78 billion in assets under management as of June 30. The firm will continue to invest across five sectors: consumer, financial services, healthcare, life sciences and technology. It has invested $49 billion in more than 430 global growth companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The firm created a unique capital structure that enables the firm to scale its capital base on an ongoing basis that includes closed-end-funds, five-year managed accounts, evergreen accounts and a GP commitment, representing the largest single investor in GA‚Äôs core investing program, according to the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far this year, GA has made 65 investments, up from 42 in 2020, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-atlantic/recent_investments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase data</a>. It made seven investments in October; one of the latest was in insurance policy provider Acko, based in India, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-backed-insurtech-acko-joins-unicorn-club-with-255-million-funding/">raised $225 million</a> in October. Overall, the firm had 130 exits of portfolio companies.</p>
<p>GA also saw 21 IPOs and direct listings of portfolio companies in 2021 thus far, which includes companies like payment software company EngageSmart, which <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/general-atlantic-backed-payments-company-engagesmart-files-for-ipo-2021-08-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its IPO in August</a>, and employee screening company HireRight, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/general-atlantic-backed-hireright-files-us-ipo-2021-10-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced in October</a>. That is compared to a prior record of six in both 2020 and 2019, according to a General Atlantic spokesperson.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur global growth equity strategy positions us to capitalize on the profound acceleration of digital innovation and global entrepreneurship as we seek to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital partners,‚Äù Bill Ford, chairman and CEO of General Atlantic, said in a written statement. ‚ÄúOur ability to partner with management teams, help build rapidly growing, technology-enabled companies on a global scale, and generate strong and consistent investment performance distinguishes General Atlantic from both entrepreneurs and investors.‚Äù</p>

<p>For many sales and marketing teams, finding leads is a time-consuming and tedious process. <a href="https://www.lusha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lusha</a>, a sales intelligence platform for B2B sales, is helping with a crowdsourced database that helps companies narrow down their lists of potential customers to the most likely candidates. Founded in 2016, the company was bootstrapped until it raised its Series A just nine months ago. Today, it announced it has hit unicorn status, with a $205 million Series B that puts the Tel Aviv-based startup‚Äôs valuation at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The round was led by growth equity firm PSG, with participation from ION Crossover Partners and brings Lusha‚Äôs total raised to $245 million, including <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/10/lusha-raises-40-million-to-surface-sales-lead-contact-info-in-your-browser/">its $40 million Series A announced in Februar</a>y. Co-founder and chief executive officer Yoni Tserruya said that since raising its first round of outside funding, Lusha‚Äôs growth rate has tripled and it wants to put more resources into its go-to-market strategy. The Series B will be used on Lusha‚Äôs data infrastructure, new features, privacy compliance and expanding its market share in the United States.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lusha says its user community, which contributes data like company information and business contact details, now includes more than 800,000 sales professionals and 273,000 sales organizations, including large tech firms like Facebook, Google, Dropbox and Uber. Most of Lusha‚Äôs clients are B2B SaaS companies, but it‚Äôs also used by venture capital firms, investors and recruiting agencies.</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs tools include a browser extension that displays information about a company‚Äôs industry, size, revenue and sales contacts. A ‚Äúprospecting tool‚Äù lets users filter leads into specific customer segments. Lusha also offers API and integrations so its database can be integrated into a company‚Äôs existing sales and marketing software systems. The company is GDPR-aligned and CCPA-compliant. When people are added to its database, Lusha notifies them so they can edit or remove their contact information.</p>
<p>Lusha was launched five years ago by Assaf Eisenstein and Tserruya because they realized social networks weren‚Äôt an effective way to generate quality sales leads.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we started in 2016, we realized that you can reach out to anyone because you have social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook and so on. So if you want to reach out to someone, you can do it, but the way it works with social networks is not efficient. There‚Äôs a lot of noise,‚Äù Tserruya told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúPeople were starting to ignore a lot of those reach-out requests, but the need for salespeople and marketing teams remained the same.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lusha was created to cut through the noise and help sales and marketing teams identify the people who are most likely to want to hear from them.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Lusha was like ‚ÄúWaze for salespeople,‚Äù as the company‚Äôs website puts it. Once it started crowdsourcing data from salespeople, that generated a network effect. In the early stages, a lot of the data wasn‚Äôt particularly accurate. But &#8220;as the company evolved, we realized what would make us the best in the industry and the differentiator would be the accuracy of the data and how deep the data is that we provide to customers,‚Äù said Tserruya. As a result, Lusha focused on growing its community of users, who contribute and validate data.</p>
<p>Current tailwinds for Lusha‚Äôs services include remote work as the pandemic continues. ‚ÄúSales team can‚Äôt reach out to potential buyers face to face like before,‚Äù said Tserruya. ‚ÄúCompanies that used conferences to generate leads now need to do it remotely, often while working from home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lusha operates on a freemium model. Free users get limited access to data, while those who pay for subscription packages unlock more features. Lusha‚Äôs database lets sales teams search for the contact information of decision makers at companies, but Tserruya stresses it only includes business info, not personal data, for its more than 100 million contacts. Then users give feedback about database entries, improving Lusha‚Äôs algorithms and datasets.</p>
<p>The company‚Äôs database, search feature and recommendation algorithms are meant to be an improvement over the ‚Äúspray and pray‚Äù approach, where sales and marketing teams call or email as many leads as possible.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apollo.io taps $32M to make the process of B2B sales more intelligent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/apollo-io-taps-32m-to-make-the-process-of-b2b-sales-more-intelligent/embed/#?secret=5D6bvBRCI4" data-secret="5D6bvBRCI4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>‚ÄúThe main challenge for salespeople is that they are actually selling a third or two-thirds of their time on admin or aggregating data, trying to understand who this customer is, how to reach out to them, who the right person to contact is and so on,‚Äù Tserruya said. ‚ÄúThe lack of data and intelligence wastes time for sales team, so more companies are taking a ‚Äòsuper-targeted‚Äô sales process, where they know exactly who they need to reach out to and why.‚Äù For example, users can filter companies by whether they use Salesforce, where they are located and how many people they employ.</p>
<p>He added this is similar to the marketing shift that happened about a decade ago, when companies switched their focus from billboards and TV commercials to targeted ads on Facebook and Google. For example, if a company is selling CRM software, that means they need to specifically target early-stage companies, because once one chooses a system, it will probably stick with it for years.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo what kind of triggers or signals can help you reach out to sell the CRM? For example, if the company just hired a VP of sales, or their first salespeople. If they just started to sell something, this is probably the right time to reach out to them,‚Äù Tserruya said. ‚ÄúThe timing and understanding of a company‚Äôs lifecycle is really a game-changer for a lot of B2B SaaS companies today and that‚Äôs how we try to help.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lusha‚Äôs competitors include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZoomInfo</a>, one of the biggest data providers to sales and marketing teams. ‚ÄúI think our main differentiation is that they‚Äôre very enterprise-oriented,‚Äù said Tserruya. ‚ÄúAnother differentiation is the quality of our data, because it constantly gets feedback from users, and also our ease of use, because businesses can start using it without talking to one of Lusha‚Äôs sales reps, and expand their membership plans as they grow.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, ION Crossover Partners general partner Gili Iohan said, ‚ÄúWe have been following Lusha‚Äôs progress over the last two years and found the team‚Äôs vision and execution highly impressive. As sales teams continue to leverage to drive their go-to-market strategies, Lusha is becoming an integral product for teams to optimize their outreach to improve overall win rates.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has won an appeal against a class action-style privacy litigation at the UK Supreme Court &#8212; avoiding what could have been up to ¬£3BN in damages had it lost the case.</p>
<p>The long-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">litigation</a> was brought by veteran consumer rights campaigner, Richard Lloyd, who, since 2017, has been pursing a collective lawsuit, alleging Google applied a Safari workaround to override iPhone users‚Äô privacy settings in Apple‚Äôs Safari browser between 2011 and 2012 &#8212; and seeking compensation for the breach for the estimated 4 million+ UK iPhone users affected.</p>
<p>Lloyd&#8217;s litigation had sought damages for privacy harms. More broadly, the suit sought to establish that a representative action could be brought in the UK seeking compensation for data protection violations &#8212; despite the lack of generic class action regime in UK law.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-high-court-blocks-compensation-suit-against-googles-safari-workaround/">2018</a> the High Court blocked the suit from proceeding &#8212; but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/uk-privacy-class-action-complaint-against-google-gets-unblocked/">following year</a> the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment, allowing the lawsuit to be heard.</p>
<p>However today&#8217;s unanimous Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a> essentially reverts to the High Court&#8217;s view: Blocking the representative action.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Supreme Court justices took the view that damage/loss must be suffered to claim compensation and that the need to prove damage/loss on an individual basis cannot be skipped &#8212; meaning </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compensation cannot simply be applied uniformly for &#8220;loss of control&#8221; of personal data for each member of the claimed representative class, as the Lloyd litigators had sought.¬†</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without proof of these matters, a claim for damages cannot succeed,&#8221; the Supreme Court writes, summarizing its judgement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ruling is major blow to UK campaigners&#8217; hopes of being able to bring class action-style suits against the tracking industry.</p>
<p>Had Google lost the judgement it would have opened the gate to more representative actions being brought for privacy violations. But with the adtech giant winning the appeal it is likely to put a major chill on UK class action-style suits targeting data-mining tech giants &#8212; which had, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">in recent years</a>, been attracting commercial litigation funders.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FjsF0zCcd6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">Oracle and Salesforce hit with GDPR class action lawsuits over cookie tracking consent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oracle and Salesforce hit with GDPR class action lawsuits over cookie tracking consent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/embed/#?secret=FjsF0zCcd6" data-secret="FjsF0zCcd6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Responding to the judgement today, one law firm, <a href="https://www.blmlaw.com/news/lloyd-v-google-court-finds-in-favour-of-google">BLM</a>, wrote that the outcome of the case &#8220;will be cause for celebration for Google and any organisation that handles significant amounts of data or bases its business model on the use of personal data (as well as their shareholders and/or insurers)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another law firm, Linklaters LLP, described the judgement as &#8220;a big blow to claimant law firms and funders who had hoped to create a new opt out regime for damages in the data breach sphere&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would expect a lot of similar claims issued in its wake now to fall away,&#8221; added Linklaters&#8217; Harriet Ellis, dispute resolution partner in a statement. ‚ÄúClaimant firms will be studying the decision carefully to see if there any viable opt-out class actions that can still be brought. But it looks really tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Mishcon de Reya, the law firm representing Lloyd, for comment.</p>
<p>In its own response to the Supreme Court judgement, Google avoided any discussion of the case detail &#8212; writing only:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThis claim was related to events that took place a decade ago and that we addressed at the time. People want to know that they are safe and secure online, which is why for years we&#8217;ve focused on building products and infrastructure that respect and protect people&#8217;s privacy.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>But a spokesperson for the tech giant also pointed to a statement put out by the <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/techuk-responds-to-the-judgement-of-the-supreme-court-in-the-appeal-of-richard-lloyd-v-google-llc.html">techUK</a> trade association &#8212; which <span lang="EN-US">had intervened in the case in support of Google; and which writes today that &#8220;had the appeal been rejected, this would have opened the door</span> for speculative and vexatious claims to be made against data controllers, with far-reaching consequences for both public and private organisations&#8221;.</p>
<p>The UK trade association goes on to claim that it &#8220;does not oppose representative legal action, however, we believe it is right that any action must first seek to establish whether damage has been caused to the individual as a result of a data breach before seeking compensation&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, as the Supreme Court justices note &#8212; in discussion of the costs of &#8216;opt in&#8217; (rather than &#8216;opt out&#8217;) litigation regimes &#8212; the bar to accessing justice can simply be pushed out of reach in cases where individual claims are only worth a few hundred pounds apiece (in the Lloyd litigation the suggestion was a sum of ¬£750 per person) because the associated case administration costs of processing individual claimants &#8220;may easily exceed the potential value of the claim&#8221;.</p>
<p>So &#8212; to be clear &#8212; techUK is opposing representative legal actions being brought over almost any data violation.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog, meanwhile, has shown a complete lack of willingness to enforce the law against the data-mining adtech industry &#8212; despite the ICO warning,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/"> since 2019</a>, of rampantly unlawful tracking.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is also now consulting on weakening</a> the domestic data protection regime.</p>
<p>So the question of how exactly the average UK citizen can obtain the privacy rights UK law claims wraps their information on paper looks, well, pretty murky right now&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global tech talent platform Andela <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/">attained a $1.5 billion valuation</a> this September and is currently the only non-fintech unicorn from Africa. Foreign capital propelled Andela to this status, however, Africa-focused venture capital firms such as CRE Ventures and TLcom Capital have been critical to the company&#8217;s early success.</p>
<p>Three years after investing in Andela, the latter raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million fund to invest</a> in other African startups and has done so impressively, leading most of the rounds in which it takes part. Yet, Andela remains its poster child and the firm takes pride in having made the investment years back.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the talent company&#8217;s unicorn news opening more conversations about the maturity of the African tech ecosystem, founder and managing partner <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/maurizio-caio-1580a97">Maurizio Caio</a>, one of the continent&#8217;s well-respected VC partners, believes that while African tech is minting new unicorns every other month, it is ready to consistently produce high-value exits and IPOs over the next 18 months.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231672" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot chest-beating and happiness in the African ecosystem, not necessarily about the wrong things, but a subset of the right things. We&#8217;re celebrating the amount of money that is invested and the fact that some financing rounds are associated with very high valuations, including unicorn valuations,&#8221; Caio said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think that for the long-term health of the ecosystem, we need a little bit to transition the conversation towards making money and on the return; on the fact that what counts is when these companies will eventually be sold or go public. That&#8217;s the valuation that counts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">W</span>hilst recent high-profile investments have been partly driven by the massive liquidity sitting in global capital markets looking for deployment, Caio says the primary driver is the strong business fundamentals achieved by African entrepreneurs transforming large and underserved markets.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He cites a list of markers in a playbook dubbed the &#8220;Exit Readiness Framework&#8221; to back up his thesis. In this interview with TechCrunch, Caio talks about this framework, how African tech is at the </span>start of a completely new era fuelled by structural drivers, building sustainable tech companies, venture capital, unicorns and exits.¬†<i><br />
</i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the Exit Readiness Framework?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MC:</strong> The general idea which is also the readiness framework says, for us to have a stronger African venture capital industry that sees the long-term goal, we need to attract more capital to Africa. And to do that, we need to make sure that we create value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other fundamental thing that we believe is that return comes from only one source: business fundamentals, which means you have to have great companies operating in great markets. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">should ask ourselves if we are building companies that will be able to attract buyers or attention of capital markets in the form of IPO, or SPAC or whatever because these are companies that have the substantial promise of generating a lot of cash as they win and execute in large and attractive markets.</span></p>
<p><strong>You talk about unicorns being companies executing in large and attractive markets. How does one know these sorts of markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, first of all, there is this idea that an attractive market is a large market. But other things make a market an attractive one for venture investment. One is that technology can make a difference, and the other is an industry that structurally has high margins and not a lot of CapEx. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a feature like the fact that there is consolidation happening by larger companies. From an exit perspective, you know that larger companies are looking for smaller companies to buy. Also, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen there&#8217;s evidence that other emerging markets have gone through the cycle that Africa is going through now and have attracted a lot of capital.¬†</span></p>
<p><strong>Are there particular industries that come to mind when referring to attractive markets in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is sectors with large consumer markets that are not adequately served today because it doesn&#8217;t make sense economically. So you think about education, some of the fintech segments, health &#8212; these are markets where you don&#8217;t have a lot of companies playing there because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to make money because a lot of demand in Africa is low income. But technology can help you build much lower structures and make it profitable to serve those markets. So that is the first big category &#8212; the big consumer markets where technology can make it profitable to serve.¬†</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TLcom Capital closes $71M Africa fund with plans to back 12 startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/embed/#?secret=73ja9BAVRd" data-secret="73ja9BAVRd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s another one, which in our opinion, is even bigger. We call it fixing the broken verticals and these are more B2B with sectors that are entirely fragmented and inefficient. You think of retail, logistics, talent, automotive. They are gigantic markets where you don&#8217;t have to do anything to create demand, there&#8217;s a massive amount of demand, but the experience is horrible for businesses and consumers. So you need to have entrepreneurs with technology who can reinvent and redesign these industries.¬†</span></p>
<p><strong>But I think we&#8217;re seeing more companies trying to solve what people would say are sexy problems than tackling these large underserved markets. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there is nothing that is predefined. Spaces that have not created great companies can become an attractive investment when an entrepreneur interprets and makes them bigger. So, again, I don&#8217;t think that there are sectors that, by definition, which are not attractive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see trivial problems getting funded, I don&#8217;t think we should blame the entrepreneur. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is not that we need better entrepreneurs to have a larger ecosystem in Africa; we need better investors. So it&#8217;s on us, not the entrepreneurs. We see fundamentally about 200 to 300 entrepreneurs per quarter, we look at business plans, and we talk to a subset of them, and we invest in an even smaller subset.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders have the right to launch a startup in a sexy place rather than a difficult market &#8212; sometimes some sexy problems have large markets &#8212; but it&#8217;s the responsibility of the investors to channel capital towards the areas that have the best outcome and expectations.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an investor, do you think Africa has reached an inflection point?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes. It was not realistic to think that this inflection point would have happened earlier. You know, it takes an average of 10 years or more to build a great company to a good or great exit. We all can have different views about when African venture capital started, yet it&#8217;s completely expected that the pipeline is now producing companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanding higher valuation and unicorn exits. There&#8217;s a pipeline of other companies to come, so we are at the beginning of a very natural cycle that will produce more.</span></p>
<p><strong>For all the talk of a growing ecosystem, why have we seen one major IPO and a few significant exits?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework that we adopt to assess readiness states that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if a company serving a great market has material revenues and a clear path to profitability, it is ready to be acquired. To qualify for an IPO, though, the bar is much higher; you need high growth, one-year visibility, management governance. If you want to go on an international stock exchange, like Nasdaq, you need to have at least $90 million of revenues and at least $500 million valuation.¬†</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pAleWLpTcp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=pAleWLpTcp" data-secret="pAleWLpTcp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to look at companies and see whether they are on the way to qualify for this. And that&#8217;s why when we look into the pipeline, we not only see that this framework confirms why Paystack, DPO, Sendwave were acquired or why Jumia and Fawry went public. But you can see going forward, companies that are completely ready for IPO now: Andela, SWVL, Interswitch, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave. And some companies may very soon be ready: Twiga, MFS Africa, Yoco, Kobo360, TeamApt. These are all companies that are getting there and I will not be surprised to see up to 10 IPOs over the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p><strong>Interesting. But don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s a lot, considering how more mature developing markets like India and Latin America have struggled despite many unicorns?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, we&#8217;re back to the framework, and it&#8217;s not magic. It&#8217;s about how the company is performing. So you ask yourself, is this company operating in a large and attractive market? Yes. Do they have at least $90 million in revenues? Yes. Can they command a valuation of at least $500 million? Yes. They have a great management team and a serious board and visibility in one year. Are they growing fast and can that growth be sustained? Yes. At that point, you are ready.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it&#8217;s more of a matter of needing the capital strategically because let us not forget that IPO for some of the investors is an exit event, but for the startup and CEO, it is a financing event. So the decision to go public is driven by market conditions and you don&#8217;t want to go when the market is skeptical. You want to go when you can articulate the story to the capital market that makes it attractive for that market to give you capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that many factors drive the exact timing, but when we talk about the readiness from the standpoint of what the company needs to look like, it&#8217;s possible to assess several companies that can reach those milestones.</span></p>
<p><strong>Still talking about exits, we&#8217;ve only seen a couple of acquisitions made by these unicorns, or soonicorns. Do you think this should change?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not really. On average, when public companies announce an acquisition, the stock price goes down because acquisitions are challenging to execute.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s perfect if the acquisitions are targeted at making a stronger company achieve a lower cost position and deliver more value to customers. But there are always ways of doing it organically, by developing new products and technology and entering new markets. Acquisitions work as a way of executing your strategy more quickly.</span></p>
<p><strong>How about acquisitions from international companies just like Stripe and Paystack? Is it a play we might often see in the future?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will undoubtedly be more acquisitions on behalf of non-African companies buying African companies, which will become driven by sector and strategies.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the big tech companies buy African tech companies to develop their presence in Africa? Yes. They will have their organic and inorganic strategy as Africa becomes a more profound place for these companies to be in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also particular players such as international banks, financial services companies, insurance companies or agritech interested in looking at companies they can acquire to serve the African markets. So yes, there will be more of that.¬†</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your take about foreign money and founders dominating Africa&#8217;s startups and investments?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the 10 unicorns or soon to be unicorns, most of them are led by African founders: Yoco, Flutterwave, MFS Africa, Interswitch, SWVL, Kobo360. At the beginning of most tech ecosystems in Africa, it wasn&#8217;t so, but now I think the medium-term picture is that we have African entrepreneurs.¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that once again, funds need to be intentional. And they can be an important factor in allocating capital to African investors. When we at TLcom Capital started to think about Africa, Ido and myself, we realised that we were not Africans and got Omobola and Andreata to be part of our team. And as we have hired more people, we&#8217;ve added more Africans. So the way to have more capital in Africa is to have more African venture capitalists.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other point is that, quite frankly, if there are great African companies that create employment in Africa that serves an African market that puts Africa on the map, if one of the founders is non-African, that&#8217;s fine in the big scheme of things. Let&#8217;s make sure that we convince capital markets that Africa is a great place to do business. Also, let us attract venture capitalists that don&#8217;t just write a check, get back on the plane and fly away. or hedge funds or private equity people, but African or Africa-focused venture capitalists on the ground that work with the entrepreneurs.¬†</span></p>
<p><strong>Will it help if big funds like Sequoia, Tiger or SoftBank set up teams in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a critical step and will be very important, but we&#8217;re not there now. These teams are starting to have people devoted to Africa, but yes, they will be better investors when they move people to Africa, which is needed because when </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you think about the big teams writing large checks and sitting in Africa to support companies, it is a very short list. And it should be longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think that there are two axes for that to happen. One is that these Africa-focused teams become bigger or international investors move teams to Africa. For us, the African-based VC teams&#8217; primary role is to discover the companies and help them seed and Series A and get them ready for larger checks. That way, we can involve international funds that are learning about the attractiveness of Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong style="font-weight: 400;">As venture capital records new highs in Africa and across the world, do you see that slowing down on the continent in the next couple of years?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be an amount of investment adjustment. What might happen is a lot of companies dying or fundamentally becoming irrelevant, and that&#8217;s what happens in every venture capital ecosystem.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that we will see happening is an adjustment in valuations because the high valuations that we&#8217;re seeing now are a small subset of cases driven by the companies&#8217; business fundamentals and a lot of money looking for a place to go. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we might see more reasonable and adjusted valuations from companies when they return to raise capital from less irrational investors, particularly in sectors with a bit of a bubble like fintech.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspiration wants to help commercial fleets go electric, and it has already started by financing electric mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">Revel&#8217;s ride-hail fleet of blue Teslas</a>. The startup, which finances electric vehicles and has plans to build, own and operating the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth on Wednesday with an initial $200 million in capital commitment.</p>
<p>The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure. Josh Green, founder and CEO of Inspiration, described the funding as a platform company investment, one that allows Inspiration to use that money to invest in infrastructure assets, like vehicles and charging solutions, as well as for general corporate purposes. In other words, it&#8217;s balance sheet capital, and Inspiration is only getting started.</p>
<p>The company, which has been operating on the down low since the end of Q1 this year, is in discussions with several other investors to raise more money needed to continue financing vehicles and other infrastructure-related assets, like energy systems like solar that power charging infrastructures, energy storage systems and real estate, according to Green.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a finance company, so we will always be raising money from the right sources to lower the cost of capital and be able to offer EVs to wider segments of the population,&#8221; Green told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Our near term goals are to expand into all light and medium-duty segments and use cases and build the leading EV solutions company in North America. As we do that, we want to be thought of as the go-to partner for fleet companies that want a custom, turnkey EV solution from an aligned partner wholly focused on the same end goal: Delivering maximum economic value from EV fleets while achieving meaningful GHG reductions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Inspiration aims to cater for three types of customers. The first is what the startup refers to as emerging EV fleet operators, venture-backed companies that were born based on an EV fleet. Brooklyn-based Revel, the company that started with dockless e-mopeds and has since expanded to a questionable ride-hail fleet of Teslas and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/">an EV charging superhub</a>, falls under this category. Earlier this year, Inspiration helped Revel get 49 EVs for its limited service before New York&#8217;s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) got wind of it and made it clear that a for-hire vehicle, even an electric one, would need a TLC license plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We act as their heavy asset capital partner so that they can use their venture dollars to scale their technology platform customer acquisition and partner with us for the vehicles, charging infrastructure, energy infrastructure, real estate ‚Äì all the other hard asset components that are quite expensive but necessary for successfully deploying and scaling an EV fleet,&#8221; said Green.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">The second customer segment is traditional fleet operators, like a NYC yellow cab company, that needs help transitioning their otherwise ICE-based fleet to electric.</div>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">&#8220;Basically our goal with those guys is to make deploying an EV fleet as easy and simple as buying another Toyota Camry and throwing the key to the driver,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;For those customers we help them understand which vehicles are the right ones to meet their needs, depending on their daily driving cycle and range and how long the vehicles are stationary. Then we design and implement the charging infrastructure as a system serving those vehicles to ensure business continuity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Corporate fleets are the final category of customer, and these are typical Fortune 500 companies that give company cars to sales and operations employees. Usually, these types of companies are looking for easy ways to reach corporate emissions goals.</p>
<p>Inspiration aims to provide a bespoke service to customers in all categories. It can provide a full-stack solution, says Green, from financing the vehicles to supplying and running charging infrastructure to working with energy companies to ensure electricity is being used efficiently. Or customers can pick and choose a la carte what services they need.</p>
<p>Green thinks charging infrastructure is an integral part of the business, particularly because installing it at a fleet level can be quite expensive and robust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because fleet charging requires much more power in one location, understanding energy pricing and utility rate structures and how they charge, the right time to both serve the fleet&#8217;s needs but also not get killed on your demand charges, is really important,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;In addition, the calculation on the charging side varies dramatically by location. In New York City, for example, the incentives and rate structures are very different than if you were doing it in New Orleans. So the economic benefit of the EV fleet has to take into account a lot of factors, which change by location, and we do that analysis for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="yj6qo ajU">Green, who had been working in climate and clean energy since 2003, founded the startup after a 14 month honeymoon around the world, a trip that began with ClimateTech burnout and ended with a renewed motivation to contribute to the fight against climate change. After retracing steps he had taken in Patagonia some 20 years ago only to see firsthand how climate change had morphed the once-familiar landscapes, Green came back recommitted to the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started thinking about where I could really put my shoulder against the wheel again, and EVs kept coming up as this area that has huge potential,&#8221; said Green. &#8220;Transportation is the largest source of U.S. emissions. EVs are now an area where the technology is ready, there are no technology barriers. The state of battery technology means that all these vehicles now have a base range that&#8217;s able to satisfy pretty much every application on the commercial side. So it&#8217;s become really a finance and deployment issue to solve, and those are things that I have a decent idea of how to attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith more stores on the way, we‚Äôll be ramping up our internal studios as well as developing our SDK (software development kit) to open up publishing soon,‚Äù Zhao said.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR develops its own games and technology, unlike other competitors that operate with licensed games, Zhao noted. </span>The company offers five VR games: Curse of Davy Jones, Amber Sky 2088, Star Trek Discovery: Away Mission, Deadwood Mansion and Unbound Fighting League (UFL).</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The pandemic broke out right before closing the company&#8217;s planned Series B funding in early 2020, Zhao said. About 80% of its employees had to leave the company, which was forced to file bankruptcy during the COVID crisis, he added. Sandbox VR has emerged from COVID stronger than ever. Its revenue is now up 20x compared to the beginning of this year (after reopening the global offices in April of this year). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">‚ÄúThe grit and determination exemplified by Steve and his team at the height of the pandemic was more than admirable &#8212; it‚Äôs led</span> them to become what we believe to be the strongest, most technologically advanced location-based VR offering available today,‚Äù said Andrew Chen, a16z general partner and Sandbox VR board member.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has 35 employees globally as of October, Zhao said. Sandbox VR currently operates 12 retail locations in the U.S., Canada and Asia.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The global location-based virtual reality market is projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2028, exhibiting a CAGR of 32.9% from 2021 to 2028,¬†<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/location-based-virtual-reality-market/#:~:text=Location%2DBased%20Virtual%20Reality%20Market%20size%20was%20valued%20at%20USD,market%20for%20the%20forecast%20period." target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on a report by Verified Market Research</a>.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sandbox VR started with an idea of how it can create the most immersive experience possible, like things people see in science fiction. The VR is just a component, he said, adding that the company doesn&#8217;t want to limit its business in the VR sector.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a mission to expand human interaction by using technology, Sandbox VR has an ambition to enter the metaverse industry down the road, which could take about 3-5 years more to get there, according to Zhao.¬†</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">‚ÄúAs we continue to innovate in the VR industry, we‚Äôll move towards the virtualization of our physical spaces. One day, it‚Äôll be like stepping into a portal where players can embody their persistent virtual avatars,‚Äù Zhao said.¬†</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disha.ng/">Disha</a>, a Nigeria-based platform that allows digital creators to curate, sell digital content, create portfolios and receive payments from their audience globally, announced that it was closing shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the news, Disha had bootstrapped to more than 20,000 users; at some point, it claimed to have a monthly growth rate of about 100%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Three days after announcing its shutdown, however, Disha did an about-face and said it was thinking of new options for the company and would share an update once it made a new decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, a Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/sharononyinye_/status/1455475527251369989?s=21">noticed</a> Disha FAQs on Flutterwave‚Äôs support documents, suggesting that the unicorn company might have acquired the creator platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha‚Äôs FAQs have been <a href="https://support.flutterwave.com/en/collections/3195568-disha-faq">removed</a>, Flutterwave confirmed to TechCrunch today that it has indeed bought the two-year-old platform. The terms of the deal are undisclosed; however, some sources say the purchase price is in six figures.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Flutterwave has been rumoured to acquire some startups in the past, this is its first public announcement of any acquisition since launching in 2016 to tackle Africa‚Äôs payments problems. And what‚Äôs more surprising is that the buy is outside payments or fintech.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one of the well-known platforms built from Africa, including <a href="https://selar.co/">Selar</a> and <a href="https://irawotalents.com/">Irawo</a>, targeting creators and influencers globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Disha provided them with tools to create a one-page site to curate and share links, content, portfolios and a checkout system to receive payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Disha had users globally, its revenues were low, making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With little revenues and limited resources, Disha showed signs of struggle; even ex-CEO attested to this in a now-deleted LinkedIn post where he expressed burnout while running Disha and Cregital, a design agency he founded and was CEO, a role he stepped down from in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe [the founders] decided to shut down the company because we ran out of resources to continue driving the very valid vision we had,‚Äù ex-CTO Oyemade told TechCrunch in an email. ‚ÄúWith Flutterwave, we now have a way to drive both value for creators and revenue to sustain the business. We are happy to have gotten the call from Flutterwave, which actually kept hopes alive.‚Äù</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oyemade will continue to lead the technology behind the product with a new role as software and architectural lead</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akanno and Abeng, the ex-CMO, left the company to pursue other projects.</span></p>

Certainly, it will bolster Disha‚Äôs payments checkout process and grow the platform‚Äôs base by allowing users to make transactions in over 150 currencies and 34 countries worldwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flutterwave wants to take part in the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/big-tech-famga-creator-economy/">$100 billion global creator economy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has created an opportunity for millions of freelancers and creators to use no-code tools to monetize their craft and community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúRecently, we have diversified into building tools that will help freelancers, businesses and now creators grow,‚Äù Flutterwave CEO Olugbengba ‚ÄúGB‚Äù Agboola said in an email. ‚ÄúWe saw Disha as an opportunity to capture a new market of indie creators that need innovative tools to showcase their craft and get paid. This acquisition cements our place as a growth partner for freelancers and businesses. For us, Flutterwave Store is to small businesses what Disha is to creators.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is an increasing appetite to create, own, sell or share digital experiences such as NFTs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With most of Disha‚Äôs customers based in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, it is well-positioned to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions around owning and selling these digital experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave knows that, and via this acquisition, the fintech is betting that Disha is its ticket to eat at that growing NFT table, where more than $10 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04/">spent</a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúDisha is a global tool and the global creator economy is enormous, and with NFTs growing in popularity, there‚Äôs no limit to how huge the creator economy can grow,‚Äù GB said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for complementary and alternative medicine &#8212; a wide-ranging area that includes practice-based work like yoga as well as a huge range of supplements and everything in between &#8212; has been on a massive upswing , with the global industry valued at <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$82.3 billion in 2020</a> and growing at a fast clip in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Now, a company called <a href="https://fullscript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fullscript</a>, which has built a wholesale backend and storefront builder to power the supplements businesses of alternative health practitioners providing these services, is getting a big infusion of cash to meet the opportunity. The Ottawa, Canada-based company has raised $240 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business across North America, and developing more tools to serve its customers: practitioners building complementary and integrative treatment plans (bringing together both traditional and modern approaches) for their patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We¬†believe integrated medicine will be medicine in the future,&#8221; Fullscript co-founder and CEO Kyle Braatz said in an interview. &#8220;Sixty percent practitioners are already focusing on wellness and prevention. It&#8217;s more than just pharmaceuticals, and patients are doing more than just popping a pill.&#8221; The company today offers a stock of some 20,000 products from some 300 brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231940" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment is coming from HGGC and Snapdragon Capital Partners &#8212; respectively a mid-market firm more known for private equity investments and a firm that invests in primarily health and wellness businesses. Fullscript&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, but for some context, the company has been around since 2012 and had only raised about $25 million previously, growing largely by being bootstrapped. And one reason that it will have come to investors&#8217; attention now is its financial track record on its own steam: it&#8217;s going to make $300 million in revenue this coming fiscal year, growing from a mere $40 million five years ago.</p>
<p>Fullscript is based in the same city as Shopify, and Braatz likened a little of what his company does in its own B2B2C model to what Shopify has achieved in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>Just as the latter has provided an easy way for companies selling online to build and operate their own web-based storefronts (a business that has been huge, and seen Shopify extending into a lot of adjacent areas as a result), Fullscript is addressing the needs of practitioners online.</p>
<p>Among Fullscript&#8217;s services, it helps them source supplements; set up and fulfill prescriptions for those treatments from Fullscript&#8217;s dispensary, either to pick up in their offices or have delivered to their homes; manage their patients&#8217; bigger treatment plans through an integrated approach that brings data from these treatments into a patient&#8217;s wider electronic health records; and provide supplementary reading and other educational materials about the supplements that are being dispensed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as Shopify empowers merchants, we empower practitioners,&#8221; Braatz said. And just as Shopify has brought a number of different tools online for its merchant customers to build out their businesses on the Shopify platform, so too is Fullscript developing more technology to grow its proposition. That will include more analytics for its customers, more tools for patients to monitor their own progress and purchases, and so on.</p>
<p>Fullscript&#8217;s rise comes amid a much bigger push for online health services, and specifically those geared at selling medicines and supplements. That means more potential competition from Amazons of this world (Amazon being already a <a href="https://gritdaily.com/why-amazon-is-king-of-the-supplements-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major destination for vitamins and other supplements</a>), and more attention being paid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others like Ro</a> trying to make headway in this space. But also a greater acceptance and understanding that the online component of this business is here to stay.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all smooth sailing. Complementary therapies have been a mixed bag when it comes to general acceptance and usage of them.</p>
<p>On one side, consumers, and a widening pool of traditional and modern practitioners are increasingly looking at these alongside the pharmaceutical approach. But on the other, there are a few reason why that hasn&#8217;t been more mainstream. For starters, insurance companies do not always provide coverage for these treatments as they do for the more standard medical treatments. One of the reasons for this is that, for better or worse, pharmaceutical approaches are trialled, tested, approved by regulators and generally entered into a realm of acceptance that makes it more likely that an insurance company (or practitioner) will opt for those treatments. The same has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not been the case for supplementary medicines</a>, not least because some of the effects might be harder to quantify. And partly because of that, or even from direct experience, there are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51312441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of reputable skeptics</a> when it comes to those effects.</p>
<p>Insurance is not part of the backend for the moment for Fullscript, and all of the payments for products are made by patients directly themselves.</p>
<p>In the defense of integrative approaches, however, there are plenty of reasons why consumers and the medical industry might also criticize the pharmaceutical approach, too (not least because it&#8217;s not 100% foolproof, the costs, the side effects and so on). Indeed, Braatz noted that attitudes towards integrative approaches are gradually starting to change, not least because of the many reasons that conventional approaches do not work perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole integrative market is just starting to leverage insurance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Practitioners starting to be compensated because compensation is evolving from volume to value-based. And we see hospital systems starting to build and acquire integrative clinics to keep patients out of hospital systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evolution, in effect, is as much a part of the investment strategy here as the current business is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are long term believers in the Fullscript story, and we thought that its platform, the tech they developed, and the reviews of that we&#8217;ve seen of it from the industry, would be an exciting investment. There is a ton of potential,&#8221; said Bill Conrad of HGGC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor interest in African fintech continues to grab headlines with large fundraises. Today, Africa‚Äôs largest digital payments network <a href="https://mfsafrica.com/">MFS Africa</a> joins the fray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised $100 million in Series C financing ‚Äî split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private equity fund <a href="https://www.africinvest.com/news-and-media/news/africinvest-s-permanent-vehicle-five-achieves-its-fourth-close-bringing-afdb-as-investor/">AfricInvest FIVE</a>¬†co-led the Series C round with existing investors Goodwell Investments and LUN Partners Group.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors CommerzVentures, Allan Gray Ventures,¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest also joined the round</span>, while ShoreCap III returned as an existing investor with other funds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement is the icing on the cake for the company, which has made several significant acquisitions and investments in the last couple of years rarely matched by any fintech on the continent.</span></p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, founder and CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dare-okoudjou">Dare Okoudjou</a> was quick to highlight MFS Africa‚Äôs mission on the continent: to make it easy for Africans to send and receive money just as they do with calls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For someone who spent more than a decade in the telecoms as an engineer and executive, Okoudjou has been around long enough to know how difficult it was to make a phone call in Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though calls are still expensive in Africa when compared to the rest of the world, the process of making them has become pretty simple thanks to mobile phone penetration and advancement in telecommunications. With MFS Africa, Okoudjou envisions the same for payments on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe way we take for granted the fact that we can communicate with anybody around the world via a mobile phone, my dream is that it should be the same with a mobile wallet,‚Äù CEO Okoudjou told TechCrunch during an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf you sign to any mobile wallet somewhere in the world, starting with Africa, it should be enough to transact with anybody else in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That‚Äôs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the grand mission of the company.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started the company in 2009, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions from Kenya to Zambia, Uganda, Zimbabwe and the Ivory Coast, and vice versa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s the company continued to grow, it became </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the product had use cases for small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, at the time, more than half of its users in East Africa reported using the platform for business reasons, according to Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, by merging fragmented and disparate payment schemes across the continent into one seamless network the same telecom networks operate, MFS Africa became the go-to platform for individuals and businesses to transact across borders and currencies.</span></p>
<h2>MFS has made a series of acquisitions and investments this past year</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company connects more than 320 million mobile money wallets across 35+ African countries and 700 corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also covers a broad range of financial services around bank accounts, prepaid cards and virtual debit cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a presence in Africa‚Äôs largest market, Nigeria, remained elusive for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat changed last month when <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/10/20/mfs-africa-acquires-baxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it acquired Baxi</a>, an agent banking platform developed by Capricorn Digital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria is quite different from the typical MFS market, where mobile money agents run the show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the West African country, agent banking networks are more prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because they offer a similar range of services in digitizing cash like mobile money agents in East Africa, it made sense for MFS to acquire Capricorn and have access to its more than 90,000 agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does the acquisition give MFS Africa an entry into the Nigerian market, but it also opens the company to a sophisticated agent network unseen in other African markets, said Okoudjou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile money agents are primarily helpful in providing customers with cash deposits and withdrawals whereas agent network platforms like Capricorn, via its Baxi boxes, provide underbanked and unbanked Nigerians with access to transfers, withdrawals, airtime purchases, utility bill payments, pay-TV and data subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAgent networks are the most digitalized segment of SMEs already on the continent because very often they have other businesses selling other things. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are plugged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the economy and the fabric of society,‚Äù he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúSo if you‚Äôre thinking about bringing digital payment and digital at large to SMEs in Africa, this is a pretty good place to start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again that what‚Äôs happening in Nigeria may end up being the blueprint for the rest of the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231924" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231924" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?w=680" alt="MFS" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Support-Team-1024x683-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231924" class="wp-caption-text">MFS Support Team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Baxi acquisition is completed, pending approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Okoudjou says a customer can walk to a Baxi agent and make cross-border payments to Benin, Cameroon or China, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitating payments from Africa to China falls outside the purview of MFS Africa‚Äôs holistic pan-African payments approach. However, it‚Äôs an opportunity too good to ignore: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China-Africa bilateral trade is one of the fastest-growing corridors globally, with a value <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">topping $192 billion</a> in 2019.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okoudjou says the company began considering the corridor when it kickstarted the acquisition of Beyonic, a Ugandan digital payments provider for small and medium-sized businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Johannesburg-based company had surveyed these businesses to understand their needs better and found out the most pressing issue they faced, asides from accessing loans, was sending and receiving payments to and from China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa is currently working on setting interoperability between payment networks in the Asian country and Africa, starting from Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before spreading to other markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The timeline for rollout might be next year, according to some sources.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, MFS Africa </span><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1873964/mobile-money-giant-mfs-africa-acquires-beyonic-for-enterprise-solutions/"> acquired Beyonic</a>; with Baxi, the company has made two consecutive acquisitions in the space of a year and some months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And coupled with minority stakes in smaller fintechs such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/ivorian-fintech-julaya-raises-2m-to-digitize-business-payments-in-francophone-africa/">Julaya</a>, Maviance and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Numida</a>; health insurance product Inclusivity and agritech platform Akorion, MFS Africa has done a decent job using investment and acquisitions ‚Äî methods Okoudjou terms ‚Äúinorganic growth‚Äù ‚Äî to exert its influence across the continent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, MFS Africa raised its Series B and closed at $23 million after some extensions. With this Series C round, its total equity raise is over $95 million while debt stands at $30 million (the company is raising debt for the first time). Emerging markets lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/emerging-markets-lender-lendable-seeks-100m-to-fund-fintech-companies/">Lendable</a> and Norsad provided the debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt presents an opportunity for many founders and startups to have cheaper funding because they do not have to give out equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MFS Africa‚Äôs case, it raised debt financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf someone is sending money from Kenya to Uganda in less than a minute, someone needs to be out of pocket. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We manage that across all these countries across all these partners, and you need a little bit of oil to grease the system,‚Äù said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe realized we don‚Äôt need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that‚Äôs one of the reasons we looked at debt and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again, as the ecosystem matures, more companies will also do a combination of debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa intends to use the new investment in several ways. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it wants to double down on its expansion efforts and add more regional offices across the continent and in the U.S. and China</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It recently opened new offices in Abidjan, Kampala, Kinshasa, Nairobi and Lagos while moving its headquarters from Mauritius to London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-year-old company has also earmarked some funding to strengthen its Governance, Risks and Compliance (GRC) functions and treasury and liquidity pool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to hire more talent within and outside the continent and continue investing in other African tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/juliustichelaar">Julius Tichelaar</a>, a partner at AfricInvest FIVE, said his firm led the round because MFS Africa‚Äôs broad range of financial and payments services resonates with AfricInvest FIVE‚Äôs financial inclusion strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúCross border payments remain an important challenge in many African markets today and MFS Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned to confront this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join MFS Africa‚Äôs world-class management team on its mission and to support its growth journey,‚Äù he concluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.amenitiz.io">Amenitiz</a>, a Barcelona-based startup that describes its products as the operating system for independent hoteliers, B&amp;Bs and cottages. In more technical terms, Amenitiz has been building a vertical software-as-a-service product that combines everything you need to run a hotel.</p>
<p>The company just raised a $7.5 million (‚Ç¨6.5 million) seed round led by Point Nine. Backed, Otium and several business angels, such as Avi Meier, Matt Robinson and Carlos Gonzales, also participated in today‚Äôs round. Jean-Christophe Taunay and Arthur Waller are also going to be independent board members.</p>
<p>In particular, Amenitiz takes care of three important bricks in the hotel industry ‚Äî&nbsp;it‚Äôs a property management system, it acts a channel manager and it let you accept direct bookings more easily.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You may have noticed that the same hotel is listed on many different websites that mostly belong to two companies ‚Äî&nbsp;Booking Holdings (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak‚Ä¶) and Expedia Group (Expedia, Hotels.com, HomeAway, Trivago‚Ä¶). As distribution channels are highly fragmented, it has become complicated to manage listings on all those websites.</p>
<p>Hotels usually rely on channel managers to avoid cumbersome micro-management work. A channel manager can manage your listings across dozens of booking sites at once. Bookings are synchronized, which means that your hotel will appear as full on Hotels.com when you have sold the last room on Booking.com.</p>
<p>And a channel manager becomes even more useful when it integrates directly with your property management system (PMS). That tool lets you manage your hotel. For instance, you can allocate rooms, add an extra night and get an overview of the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on legacy technology, Amenitiz wants to create a proper software-as-a-service alternative that works well out of the box. As an added benefit, you can build cool stuff on top of this foundation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, the startup also helps you create a website your for your hotel or B&amp;B. On this site, you can let users book rooms directly using the startup‚Äôs booking module. And even if people want to book a room with a phone call or a WhatsApp message, you can send a payment link and track the booking in Amenitiz.</p>
<p>So far, Amenitiz has attracted 3,000 properties. With today‚Äôs funding round, Amenitiz plans to add more features, such as revenue management. It‚Äôll triple the size of its teal with a focus on the French, Italian and Spanish markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan edtech startup</span><a href="https://craydel.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a platform for comparing colleges, course options and tuition fees, has secured $1 million in a pre-seed round that will go toward improving its search and recommendation technology and enhancing its online resources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Enza Capital, a private venture fund that invests in early-stage tech startups across Africa. Other investors in the round include Future of Learning Fund, a Kenya-based edtech backer; BriteGaze, a South African artificial intelligence fund; Bisk Ventures; a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm and Tekton Ventures; a San Francisco-based technology investment firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya-based Chandaria Capital, Nigeria-based LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund, and an array of other angel investors including founders and top executives of Africa‚Äôs leading SaaS, e-commerce and education startups joined, as well.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231607" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel was launched earlier this year by co-founders </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-sardana-a570497/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manish Sardana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-nguru-38677638/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Nguru</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayne-aman-premji/?originalSubdomain=ke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shayne Aman Premji</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was inspired by the lack of a reliable portal in Africa to guide decisions on college and course selection. This provided a window of opportunity for the trio to bring to life a platform that would eliminate this challenge. Through Craydel, the founders said, they are giving power back to students by providing them with access to a portal that offers verified information about colleges to help them in decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAn estimated $30 billion is spent every year on higher education in Africa,&#8221; Sardana, Craydel&#8217;s CEO, said. &#8220;But the current student experience in accessing higher education is abysmal. There is no aggregation of choices, and decision-making is influenced by biases and misinformation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe are transforming the way students discover, compare and apply to higher education in Africa,‚Äù he said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craydel provides students with options at every level, including online certificate programs, for which they can enroll to test the waters before settling on a final decision about the careers they want to pursue.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe believe in the power of the youth in Africa to create lasting transformative change. And Craydel is driven to empower them to access the best education pathways to unleash their true potential,‚Äù said Sardana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premji, Craydel‚Äôs chief financial officer, told TechCrunch that the edtech startup also takes the students through a career assessment to ensure they are a good fit for the chosen program and college. It also guides them on course application and visa processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has so far partnered with more than 90 universities and vocational colleges in Africa and abroad, and currently provides a listing of 3,000 higher education programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Craydel is set to embark on a new path to build its search and recommendation engine for more spot-on suggestions, as well as build resources that will help students and professionals in the decision-making.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThis paradox of choice is sometimes not a good thing,&#8221; Premji said. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re building using AI at the search and recommendation engine, which is proprietary technology to us. Through it, students or working professionals will tell us their interests, grades, budgets. We will also talk about their career aspirations and conduct aptitude assessments. The outcome of all these assessments is a curated list of the leading potential choices for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edtech space in Africa is still nascent, but it is expected to grow as internet penetration deepens &#8212; connecting more people &#8212; and as more students enroll in higher education across the continent.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://kenza-bouhaj.medium.com/edtech-in-africa-a-landscape-6bb03c299b33"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending on education in Africa is expected to grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $740 billion by 2030, at a 14% compound annual growth rate, and edtech spending is projected to expand fast, reaching $57 billion by 2030. Africa‚Äôs burgeoning young population provides an opportunity for the growth of companies such as Craydel, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">edtech providing solutions for many challenges, including those of accessibility, quality, affordability and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äã‚ÄãKenya has several edtech startups, including</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched last year to offer live lessons for students up to 18 years old; <a href="https://enezaeducation.com/">Eneza Education</a>, which enables learning through mobile technology; and <a href="https://e-limu.org/">e-Limu</a>, a literacy app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Access to higher education and skills development for Africa&#8217;s growing youth population remains fragmented, yet is a fundamental cornerstone to our accelerated development,‚Äù </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Enza Capital managing partner Mike Mompi, who is set to join Craydel‚Äôs board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúCraydel is building the rails to democratize access to higher education and to support millions of Africans up this curve.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery firm Zomato is in talks to back logistics firm Shiprocket, savings app Magicpin, and health and fitness firm CureFit, four people familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>All these investment talks are at final stages and some may close as soon as this week, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The investment in Shiprocket is part of a broader round that is being led by Singapore&#8217;s Temasek, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Indian newspaper Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/shiprocket-eyes-200-million-from-temasek-and-others/articleshow/86025605.cms">first reported</a> about Temasek and Shiprocket talks. MoneyControl also reported about some of these talks and <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/exclusive-zomato-wants-to-do-an-info-edge-scouts-for-investments-in-startups-7698731.html">Zomato&#8217;s investment strategy</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, has explored investment opportunities in his personal capacity as well as through the firm in at least over half a dozen startups in recent months, according to sources at many of those firms.</p>
<p>In June, the publicly listed firm Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/">invested $100 million in online grocer Grofers</a>, and according to two people familiar with the matter, has told the younger firm that it is open to fully acquiring it at a later stage if certain metrics are achieved.</p>
<p>Zomato declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid on-demand grocery and convenience delivery craze that has taken over Europe and the U.S. this past year is gradually making its way into Africa and the Middle East.</span></p>
<p>Today, the spotlight is on RabbitMart, or <a href="https://www.rabbitmart.com/">Rabbit</a> for short, a startup coming out of stealth with <span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million in pre-seed funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit is the latest of a long list of startups investors are willing to pump money into globally to deliver groceries and other items from neighbourhood fulfilment centres to people‚Äôs homes in 20 minutes or less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Egypt and Africa at large, Rabbit is one of the pioneers alongside Breadfast, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/">announced</a> that it would begin to complete deliveries in less than 20 minutes.¬†</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, Foundation Venture, MSA Capital and Goodwater Capital participated in this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-seed round, a new record for its stage in Africa and the Middle East, surpassing Egyptian fintech Telda at $5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmadyousry">Ahmad Yousry</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/walidshabana">Walid Shabana</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismail-hafez">Ismail Hafez</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarek-elgeresy-256a9987">Tarek El Geresy</a> founded Rabbit in June. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Yousry, in an interview with TechCrunch, said the founders began discussing the idea of replicating fast delivery models in Egypt after noticing that he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experienced a sequence of slow and failed deliveries whenever he ordered groceries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúYou make an order, but you‚Äôre not quite sure if it‚Äôs gonna come or it‚Äôs going to be out of stock,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not quite sure if it‚Äôs going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 100% or it‚Äôs going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be delivered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on time or delayed. You‚Äôre not quite sure what you are going to get.‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a surface level, groceries are items people forget to buy and panic when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need them, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†is why most on-demand platforms in Europe, such as Getir and Gorillas, launched first in that vertical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But over time, they found out that on-demand retail &#8212; offering other items that an impulse buyer would need in, say, a supermarket &#8212; was a bigger market and opportunity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the case with Yousry and his co-founders; they</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studied use cases where people bought stuff from e-commerce platforms but would wait days to get it and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled on basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWhatever the consumer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants under 20 minutes, we‚Äôre going to let the market dictate what we sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit operates similarly to other international on-demand convenience delivery startups before it. It has taken the Amazon model, large warehousing and broken it down into small pieces &#8212; micro-fulfilment centres &#8212; in four neighbourhoods across Cairo: Mohandeseen, Zamalek, Maadi and Nasr City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit buys these five categories of items (groceries, basic fashion items, cosmetics, toys and household items) from third-party suppliers, stores them in its warehouses, adds a markup and sells through an app with a flat delivery fee for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it controls the end-to-end experience on its platform. It has a live inventory tracking system in its warehouses to monitor what‚Äôs on the shelf and equip riders &#8212; some employed, some self-employed &#8212; with the necessary protective gear and technology to make the deliveries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six-month-old startup plans to add a new fulfilment centre every other week till the end of the year to cover several major cities in the next 12 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabbit has been in stealth since June and only launched last month. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first two days, about 30% of the orders delivered </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were completed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in less than 20 minutes; last week, the number increased to 90%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe way we look at it is straightforward. If McDonald‚Äôs can deliver sandwiches in 30 minutes, and they still have to make the sandwich, then if we get things right, we can easily deliver in 20 minutes.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many publications covering the frenzy happening within the on-demand convenience delivery space have probed the question of whether these companies can fulfil their delivery times without breaking their riders. It‚Äôs a situation Gorillas has faced this year; in a bid to execute deliveries in less than 10 minutes, it has attracted protests from some drivers demanding improved working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yousry says Rabbit‚Äôs tech and operations are such that an in-house team takes care of receiving an order and packaging in 120 seconds or less</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, the rest, about 18 minutes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for drivers to complete the order. This way, Yousry hopes the company will not have to be at loggerheads with its drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly the reason why we went with 20 minutes and not 10. We could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do 10 minutes, but if we do, we‚Äôre stretching our delivery riders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it wouldn‚Äôt account for their health and safety,‚Äù said Yousry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For us, there are two minutes under the roof, and there‚Äôs the rest on delivery time; it gives the couriers time to drive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They don‚Äôt need to rush, and they abide by traffic regulations and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take things slower.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, only a few people have used the service, and while Yousry does not give hard numbers on traction, he said the company now completes more than 50 orders per location daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects Rabbit to process hundreds of thousands of orders per month soon. But with a little more than 50 riders, how does it plan to achieve that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The CEO said the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is currently recruiting over 100 roles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across driver, in-store and human resources departments to meet the high influx of demand it expects after going live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Lorenzo Franzi, a partner at Global Founders Capital, said, ‚ÄúThe Rabbit team is setting a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">totally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new standard for the grocery industry in Egypt and the broader region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They offer a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new experience to customers compared to traditional grocers and local stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Talal Alasmari of Raed Ventures said his firm backed the six-month-old startup because the founders have the vision and expertise to lead the ‚Äúultra-fast delivery domain‚Äù in Egypt, the Middle East and Africa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mathpresso, the Seoul-based edtech company behind QANDA, an AI-based learning app for K-12 students, announced today it has added Google as a new investor.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s undisclosed investment is not part of its Series C raised in June, the company said without providing its valuation.</p>
<p>The additional investment event comes five months after its $50 million Series C, which brought its total funding to $105 million as of June. The company&#8217;s previous backers include SoftBank Venture Asia, MiraeAsset Venture Investment, Smilegate Investment, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation and Legend Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mathpresso expects to create synergies with Google in terms of its global market expansion and technological advancement.</p>
<p>More than 85% of QANDA‚Äôs users are outside of Korea, in Japan and Southeast Asia. The Seoul-headquartered startup has offices in Tokyo, Hanoi, Jakarta and Bangkok and offers seven languages: English, Spanish, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian.</p>
<p>Mathpresso was founded in 2015 by co-CEO Ray Lee and Jake Lee, who developed QANDA as a 1:1 Q&amp;A service platform. In 2016, Mathpresso launched QANDA, which provides detailed math solutions and personalized learning content catered to each user‚Äôs level. QANDA‚Äôs AI-based optical character recognition (OCR) technology, added in 2017, recognizes text and mathematical formulas in a photo and enables users to search for answers in seconds.</p>
<p>Approximately 10 million photos are uploaded every day on QANDA platform, the statement said. The company claims that the QANDA app has amassed over 45 million registered users and 3 billion education data points, with over 12 million monthly active users in 50 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mathpresso added new features on QANDA earlier this year, including the premium subscription model that offers unlimited ‚Äúbyte-sized‚Äù micro-video lectures and the community feature that enhances collaborative learning like an online study group.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe investment by Google opens up exciting opportunities for Mathpresso and enhances our ability to serve students around the world,‚Äù said Chief Financial Officer of Mathpresseo Soo Nahm. ‚ÄúTogether with the recent Series C funding, this investment will help us accelerate our global market expansion as well as our technological advancement.‚Äù</p>
<p>QANDA is available on Android, iOS and Web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nio, a Chinese electric vehicle startup listed on the NYSE, will be in at least six European markets by 2022.</p>
<p>The firm shared its ambitions for Europe on its earnings call this week. Nio is already taking orders for its electric SUVs and shipping small batches<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Norway</a>, its first stop outside China. It didn&#8217;t identify which five countries it will enter next year.</p>
<p>The young carmaker challenges behemoths like Tesla and covets a slice of the luxury car market. I wasn&#8217;t convinced that the seven-year-old startup could lure customers away from Mercedez Benz or BMW. But recently, a friend, who used to be religious about German cars, paid about $70,000 for a Nio sports sedan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What hooks him isn&#8217;t the car&#8217;s sleek design or its marketed 600-kilometer range. It&#8217;s the experience <em>around</em> owning a Nio.</p>
<p>When his wife goes shopping, my friend passes time with his daughter in one of Nio&#8217;s owner clubs, which sit in posh malls across China&#8217;s affluent cities. He shows me a Nio app, which has data on his car&#8217;s status and lets him speak to a human assistant in real-time. The app also has a news feature, an e-commerce store and a user forum. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I bought a lot of stuff off its store,&#8221; he says while scrolling through other owners&#8217; posts. What Nio has created is an all-in-one &#8220;super app&#8221; that Chinese users have gotten used to, thanks to Tencent and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Now Nio is exporting that user experience to Europe, home to some of the world&#8217;s most revered automakers.</p>
<p>To be sure, Norway is a small market with a population of five million people. Nio still has a long way to go before proving its potential in larger markets like Germany and the United Kingdom. Its success, then, hinges on whether it could delegate real power to its country managers. It&#8217;s up to founder William Li to decide how much control to give to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-schwarz-66354a46/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Schwarz</a>, Nio&#8217;s first Europe CEO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orders in Norway had &#8220;exceeded expectation&#8221; and &#8220;a quarter&#8221; of the customers who tried its cars ended up placing an order, Nio said on this week&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>The company proposes a &#8220;battery-as-a-service&#8221; model that allows people to buy its car without a battery and pay for a BaaS subscription later. But the vision requires the setup of a charging network throughout a new country, which is no small feat in the age of COVID.</p>

<p>Xpeng, Nio&#8217;s archrival in China, has yet to expand out of China but has plans to do so, according to a recent <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/26/xpeng-inc-xpev-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">analyst call</a>. Starting 2023, Xpeng will launch &#8220;at least two or three new vehicles every year&#8221; supporting its flagship driver assistance system. It also &#8220;intends to make these future new models, including hardware, software and services simultaneously available in China and in international markets,&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting and challenging time for China&#8217;s new EV makers, which are supercharged with investor money and advanced technology. But as Chinese companies, they are coping with an increasingly hostile global environment. And as they let algorithms play a bigger role in steering vehicles, they will face a barrage of questions about how they protect user safety and data privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has ruled that Apple can&#8217;t push back the deadline to update App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court&#8217;s decision</a> on California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist as Epic Games had alleged, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple&#8217;s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. The court&#8217;s original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple&#8217;s own payment systems, but Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided &#8212; a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">September 10, 2021 ruling</a> issued by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on the Epic Games antitrust case had ordered Apple to no longer stop developers from:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;&#8230;including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court also said Apple couldn&#8217;t prevent developers from communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through their account registration within the app.</p>
<p>Apple in October <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods/">officially updated its App Store rules</a> to address developers&#8217; ability to communicate with their users, as that change was also a part of its settlement with a group of U.S. developers in a class-action lawsuit over the same matter. However, upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal of the Epic Games lawsuit</a>, Apple asked for a stay on the injunction Judge Gonzalez Rogers had put into place which would open up the App Store to non-Apple payment systems.</p>
<p>Per the ruling, the required App Store policy changes had an early December deadline, as the judge ordered the injunction to be implemented within 90 days of the September 10 ruling. That meant, if Apple wasn&#8217;t granted this stay on the injunction, it would have to permit developers to point to alternative means of payment inside their iOS apps.</p>
<p>During a November 9 hearing to hear arguments both for and against the stay, Apple&#8217;s legal counsel argued that the changes Apple was being forced to implement would &#8220;upset the platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is the fact. It is going to happen,&#8221; said Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher partner Mark Perry, a lead lawyer for Apple on the Epic Games case. He reiterated Apple&#8217;s position that allowing links inside apps could introduce security and privacy risks into the iOS ecosystem.</p>
<p>Epic Games&#8217; counsel, Gary Bornstein, pointed out that Apple said during the trial that its first-party payments platform competed with web payments. It can&#8217;t turn around and now say that raising consumer awareness about this competitive alternative would now cause &#8220;irreparable harm.&#8221; He added, too, that Apple shouldn&#8217;t be left to sort out the changes on its own as, so far, many of the steps Apple has taken to open up the App Store were in response to either class action lawsuits or legislative and regulatory developments. Apple disagreed, pointing to other pro-consumer changes it has made, like the App Store privacy labels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judge ruled today that Apple failed to successfully argue its case for a stay and denied the motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, Apple‚Äôs motion is based on a selective reading of this Court‚Äôs findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property,&#8221; wrote Judge Gonzalez Rogers. &#8220;This incipient antitrust conduct is the result, in part, of the anti-steering policies which Apple has enforced to harm competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Apple said it intends to try again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Epic Games didn&#8217;t have any immediate comment.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision, if upheld, could have a significant impact on the App Store&#8217;s business model, as developers looking to skirt Apple&#8217;s commissions would be able to point their users to other payment methods when the policy is updated. The fallout from the decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business">could cost</a> the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-stands-to-lose-a-few-billion-dollars-annually-from-ruling?sref=gni836kR">billions</a>, depending on how many developers take up the opportunity and how many consumers decide to pay outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Already, some in the market were moving forward to capitalize on that potential change before the policy had been officially revised.</p>
<p>For example, Paddle, a solutions provider for subscription businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/in-hopes-of-app-store-changes-paddle-develops-an-alternative-to-apples-payments-system/">announced</a> rather prematurely it would introduce a new in-app purchasing system aimed at iOS developers that would allow a drop-in replacement to Apple‚Äôs own payments system as soon as the injunction went into effect. (A full replacement for Apple‚Äôs in-app purchase system  wouldn‚Äôt be permitted, however, only external links.) Facebook, meanwhile, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">rolled out a system for direct creator payments</a> bypassing the App Store. This system was technically permitted because Facebook isn&#8217;t taking a cut of creator revenues for the time being. But with a decision that permits other payment mechanisms, that system could change in the future opening up a new revenue stream for the social network.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how exactly Apple will rewrite its rules to comply with the court&#8217;s decision if it&#8217;s not able to convince the court to grant its motion. When South Korea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">issued a new law</a> also requiring app stores to allow for other payment mechanisms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">Google complied</a> while adjusting <a href=‚Äú https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments‚Äù>fees</a>, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/">Apple said</a> its current policies were in compliance due to how the law was written.</p>
<p>The court reminded Apple it had 90 days to comply with the injunction per the original ruling and still has approximately 30 days before it goes into effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric automaker Rivian <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has priced its initial public offering at $78 a share, pushing it far above its targeted share price as investors dove in the year&#8217;s most highly anticipated IPO.</span></p>
<p>Updated: the story haas been updated to reflect the regulatory filing figures.</p>
<p>The company offered 153 million shares of common stock at the $78 per share price,¬†according to regulatory filing was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm">posted late Friday evening</a>. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231786" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The gross proceeds from the offering is expected to be about $11.9 billion, before accounting for commissions, discounts and other expenses. That amount also excludes the underwriters option to buy additional shares. If underwriters exercise those options, Rivian stands to raise a total of $13.8 billion.</p>
<p>On a fully dilated basis, that places Rivian&#8217;s valuation at more than $77 billion.</p>
<p>The company, which is backed by Amazon, said in a filing earlier this month that it planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. It then upped the range to between $72 and $74 due to investor interest in company.</p>
<p>Rivian filed October 1 to become a¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">publicly traded company</a>¬†in the United States. The S-1 document did not disclose the targeted share price at the time. An amended document filed Monday provided the new information, which included interest from repeat backer Amazon and newcomer Blackstone in Rivian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Coatue Management, Franklin Templeton, Capital Research Global Investors, D1 Capital Partners LP, Third Point LLC, funds affiliated with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and certain entities affiliated with Soros Fund Management LLC have indicated an interest in buying up to $5 billion of shares of Class A common stock.</p>
<p>A recent filing by Amazon shows the e-commerce giant already holds more than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p>
