										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, the 14-year-old, Toronto-based, venture-backed storytelling platform with reach into a number of verticals, is being acquired by Naver, the South Korean conglomerate, in a $600 million cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Naver plans to incorporate at least part of the business into another of its holdings, the publishing platform <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon</a>, which Naver launched in 2004, brought to the U.S. in 2014, and that features thousands of comic strips created by its users. It also has a huge audience. According to Naver, Webtoon was averaging more than <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">67 million monthly users</a> as of last August.</p>
<p>On its face, the deal appears to make sense. According to Korea&#8217;s Pulse News, some of the region&#8217;s webtoons are finding a broader geographic audience and <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2020&amp;no=927016">crossing over into film</a>. (Below is a trailer for one popular series called &#8220;The Secret of Angel.&#8221;)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, Wattpad, which originally launched as an e-reading app, has evolved into a highly popular platform where users publish their original work and more than 90 million people visit monthly to read them. (Indeed, according to a story published last week in the Verge, Wattpad has published more than a billion stories over the years,  and it claims its users spend a collective <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22215052/wattpad-authors-fanfiction-netflix-hulu-streaming-movies-romcom-teen-drama">22 billion minutes per month</a> reading these.)</p>
<p>Like Webtoon, Wattpad has been more focused on streaming media, given the many platforms now needing fresh content, from Netflix to Apple to farther flung outfits, like GoJek&#8217;s GoPlay, launched by the Indonesian ride-hailing giant in 2019. (In addition to <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">Wattpad Studios</a>, Wattpad also launched a book <a href="https://company.wattpad.com/blog/2019/1/23/wattpad-launches-wattpad-books-a-new-publishing-division-to-bring-diverse-data-backed-stories-to-book-lovers-everywhere">publishing division</a> in 2019.)</p>
<p>CEO Jun Koo Kim of Webtoon said in a press release about the new tie-up that it represents a &#8220;big step towards us becoming a leading global multimedia entertainment company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CEO Seong-Sook Han of Naver &#8212; a search engine giant whose properties include the popular Tokyo-based messaging app Line &#8212; said in a separate release that Wattpad co-founders Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen will continue to lead the company they have built post-acquisition.</p>
<p>As for whether the acquisition is a win for Wattpad&#8217;s investors, it appears to be a moderate one. (It&#8217;s hard to discern much without knowing the terms under which each outfit invested.)</p>
<p>Wattpaid had raised $117.8 million from investors in Asia, the United States, and Canada over the years and closed its most recent round with $51 million from Tencent Holdings, BDC, Globe Telecom’s Kickstart Ventures, Peterson Group, Canso, and Raine Ventures.</p>
<p>That last deal, announced in 2018, assigned the company a post-money valuation of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/storytelling-app-wattpad-raises-51m-at-a-398m-valuation/"> $398 million according to Pitchbook</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve spent more time than I care to mention over the last several years wondering aloud about the value of in-person trade shows. There’s something seemingly antiquated in the idea of jamming a bunch of people in a room, walking from booth to booth. Sure, they’ve fulfilled an important need in the past, but aren’t they just a relic in this hyperconnected world?</p>
<p>I’ve always assumed that if trade shows were to go extinct, it would be a gradual process &#8212; a slow fade into cultural irrelevance, like bookstores and record stores (both things I miss dearly). Technology has, for many intents and purposes, dramatically reduced their relative value to our society.</p>
<p>While it’s undoubtedly true that Spotify and the Kindle Store are lacking in much of the appeal and all of the charm of their real-world counterparts, we’re happy to sacrifice all that and more at the alter of convenience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A rampaging pandemic has effectively given us a year without in-person trade shows. That means, among other things, we’ve had a much more immediate control variable in this question about trade shows. Last year’s CES managed to get in just under the wire. The next major consumer electronics show &#8212; Mobile World Congress &#8212; was eventually canceled after much hand-wringing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pHHD1DQ7eM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/">GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concerns</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concerns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/embed/#?secret=pHHD1DQ7eM" data-secret="pHHD1DQ7eM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The CTA (the governing body behind CES) appeared to have been planning a scaled-back in-person version of the show this year, following a similar move by the team behind the Berlin-based IFA over the summer. By July, however, it was clear that such a plan was untenable. To put it bluntly, the United States didn’t have its shit together when it comes to keeping this virus in check (I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we just hit 400,000 deaths on the day I’m writing this).</p>
<p>CES 2021 was far from the first tech show to go all virtual over this past year. The size and scope of the event, on the other hand, are relatively unique here. Per the CTA, the 2020 show drew north of 170,000 attendees. The majority of the tech events I’ve attended virtually in the past year have been put on by a single company. CES is obviously a different beast entirely.</p>
<p>The CTA’s (nee CEA) role in the industry certainly afforded it a fair bit of goodwill up front. The show, after all, dates back to the late-60s. It has ebbed and flowed over the years (taking hits from external forces like the 2008 financial crisis), but it has remained a constant. Those of us who’ve been doing this for a while tend to face the show with equal parts anticipation and dread. But the companies always come out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nImRKwoR2D"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/ces-cancels-las-vegas-event-goes-online-only/">CES cancels Las Vegas event, goes online-only</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CES cancels Las Vegas event, goes online-only&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/ces-cancels-las-vegas-event-goes-online-only/embed/#?secret=nImRKwoR2D" data-secret="nImRKwoR2D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Per the CTA’s numbers, nearly 2,000 companies launched products at the 2021 event. The figure pales in comparison to the 4,419 companies exhibiting last year, but that’s to be expected. In addition to the uncertain nature of the event, it’s been a remarkably crappy year for plenty of companies. I certainly had my questions and doubts going in &#8212; chief among them was the value of an event like this for a startup? Without an in-person element, wasn’t this just yet another chance to get lost in the noise?</p>
<p>I heard similar feedback from startups on the side, though ultimately nearly 700 chose to exhibit at the show. I know because I ended up going through all of them for the purposes of our coverage. It brought back a kind of visceral memory of the year I challenged myself to walk every square inch of the show, and ended up being challenging for entirely different reasons.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this was the element I missed the most. For me, CES’s biggest appeal has been the element of discovery. Eureka Park, the jam-packed startup portion of the show at the Sands Expo, is easily the best part. The vast majority of exhibitors are not for us, but I still get a charge stumbling on something new and innovative I’ve not seen before. The blogger instinct that lives dormant inside kicks in and I can’t wait to get back in front of my laptop to tell the world.</p>
<p>There was no Eureka Park this year &#8212; not even a virtual version. There’s just no good way to approximate a show floor online &#8212; at least none that I’m aware of. A couple of existing contacts offered to send me stuff in the mail to look out. Sensel, for instance, has a new version of its trackpad (which it announced today will be integrated into Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad). But for obvious reasons, it’s just not possible to get all 700 startups to send review units to my one-bedroom in Queens.</p>
<p>More than anything, the virtual event highlighted the technology limitations of an event at this scale. Press conferences are simple enough (though I found frustration in the various different platforms the CTA employed). More often than not, these felt like lengthy commercials for the exhibiting company. The in-person versions are, as well, of course, but we tend to be blinded by the spectacle. For my own purposes, there just wasn’t a lot that that couldn’t have been accomplished more efficiently with a press release.</p>
<p>The nature of news releases was far more nebulous this year. More companies seemingly took liberties by dumping their news well ahead of the show. Other companies offered their own sort of counter programming. One of the biggest advantages to these events when it comes to my own peace of mind is how they regulate the news flow. I know going into the year that there’s going to be one hair-pullingly difficult week at the beginning of the year where a ton of news is announced.</p>
<p>With CES less of a center of gravity this year, I anticipated seeing a less segmented news flow. I’ve commented to colleagues over the last couple of years that there’s “no more slow season” when it comes to hardware news, and this will likely only increase that sentiment. Obviously there’s upside in having things more evenly spread out, but I’ve got the feeling we’re moving toward something more akin to a series of small CES-like events throughout the year, and the thought makes my blood turn cold.</p>

<p>It’s been clear in recent years that companies would rather break out from the noise of CES in favor of their own events, following in Apple’s footsteps. Virtual events are a perfect opportunity to adopt that approach. Apple, meanwhile, moved from one event to a series of one smaller event every month toward the end of the year. When you’re not asking people to fly across the country or world to attend an event, the bar for what qualifies as news lowers considerably. Perhaps instead of having thousands of companies vying for our attention at one event, we’re moving toward a model in which there are instead thousands of events. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>I have some hyper-specific grievances about the CTA’s format, but I’ll save them for the post-event survey that I may or may not get around to filling out. I still found value in the virtual event. It was an excuse to talk to a bunch of startups I wasn’t familiar with. Ultimately, however, I think the event served as a testament to the fact that as much as we bemoan all of the headaches and head colds that come with an event like CES, there’s still a lot of value to be had in the in-person event.</p>
<p>There’s little doubt that the CTA and the rest of these sorts of organizations are champing at the bit to return to in-person events, even as a bumpy vaccine rollout leaves a big question mark around the expected timeline. There’s a very good chance that we’ll view 2020/2021 as the beginning of the end for the in-person trade show. But given the sorts of limitations we’ve seen in the past year, I’m not ready to declare them fully dead any time soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decentralized tech community is aiming to find support for technologies that go beyond cryptocurrency support.</p>
<p>In a blog post today the team at Brave <a href="https://brave.com/ipfs-support/">announced</a> that they have worked with Protocol Labs to integrate native support for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) inside their browser. The peer-to-peer file-sharing standard launched in 2015 and has been gathering support among open-source advocates who laud the protocol&#8217;s ability to stop companies and government bodies from taking down content across the web, as well as the more functional performance improvements, offline file-viewing capabilities and underlying reliability.</p>
<p>IPFS shares plenty of similarities with BitTorrent and allows files to be hosted by a multitude of users distributed across networks. With the update, Brave users will be able to access content from web addresses starting with <em>ipfs://</em> and will be able to host an IPFS node themselves. The company says that adding support for IPFS will help improve &#8220;the overall resilience of the Internet.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why The Internet Needs IPFS Before It&#8217;s Too Late&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/04/why-the-internet-needs-ipfs-before-its-too-late/embed/#?secret=I8YcqmtsFz" data-secret="I8YcqmtsFz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brave is a likely home for the IPFS protocol given the company&#8217;s affinity for all things decentralized. The startup founded by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich says it now has 24 million monthly active users. Some of Brave&#8217;s most unique features have involved blockchain or peer-to-peer tech. In 2018, Brave announced a beta of Tor Tabs bringing the decentralized Onion protocol into the mix.</p>
<p>Last year, Opera <a href="https://press.opera.com/2020/03/30/opera-introduces-major-updates-to-its-blockchain-browser-on-android/">announced</a> that it was bringing limited support for IPFS to its Android application.</p>
<p>Decentralization tech is finding more mainstream interest as tech companies have slowly warmed up to the opportunities in cryptocurrency. Last week, TechCrunch looked into how Twitter was looking to help build out a decentralized network for social media platforms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mpj0V0t1xC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">Twitter’s decentralized future</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether this is a technology that more mainstream browsers will opt to support natively, given the clear potential for abuse that exists in allowing users to work around file takedowns and the fact that it is a pretty niche technology for the time being.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a weapon of war,&#8221; his lawyer <a href="https://www.lanuovasardegna.it/olbia/cronaca/2018/06/26/news/negli-stati-uniti-e-solo-un-gioco-1.17006714">told the investigating magistrate</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a toy they sell to children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock had been arrested in the Sardinian port city of Olbia in June 2018 after trying to board a private party bus with a collectible flamethrower from Elon Musk&#8217;s latest startup, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/">The Boring Company</a>. Craddock had painted his flamethrower black, and written on it the name of a floating music festival in the Bahamas he had attended the previous year while starring in reality TV show <a href="https://www.bravotv.com/unanchored/season-1/ep-1">Unanchored</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alarmed by the sight of what he thought was a gun, the bus driver refused to drive off, and then called the police.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were very chill at first,&#8221; Craddock told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview. &#8220;But as the night went on, it kept getting worse. I spent the first night in jail in Olbia and then they took me to prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Craddock managed to get a lawyer, she told him the judge would probably just let him go with a warning. Instead, the magistrate ordered him back to his cell. That was when Craddock, pictured below, learned possession of a flamethrower in Italy can carry a 10-year prison sentence.</p>

<p>A few months later, author John Richardson was sitting down to work at his home in London when there was a loud knock at the door. He opened it and five police officers barged in wearing tasers and tactical gear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a couple of them also had handguns,&#8221; Richardson told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I&#8217;m slightly hazy on that because my legs went wobbly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police officers sat Richardson down on his sofa and informed him that they had a warrant to search the premises. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on here?&#8217; &#8221; Richardson recalled. &#8220;Then something clicked and I said, &#8216;Is this about the flamethrower?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>The raid was indeed about his flamethrower.</p>
<p>Craddock and Richardson are not the only Boring Company customers to have fallen foul of law enforcement.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 flamethrower purchasers abroad have had their devices confiscated by customs officers or local police, with many facing fines and weapons charges. In the U.S., the flamethrowers have been implicated in at least one local and one federal criminal investigation. There have also been at least three occasions in which the Boring Company devices have been featured in weapons hauls seized from suspected drug dealers.</p>
<p>The upshot: What Musk and his army of fans thought was just another of his money-spinning larks is having real-world consequences for people and countries not in on the joke.</p>
<p>The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions from TechCrunch for this story.</p>
<h2>The spark of an idea</h2>
<p>Inspired by Los Angeles traffic, Musk launched The Boring Company in December 2016. The startup&#8217;s mission was to solve urban traffic jams by moving cars through tiny tunnels. But re-engineering sewer tunneling technology to build a revolutionary subterranean transportation network doesn&#8217;t come cheap. In an effort to drum up awareness and funds, Musk announced in December 2017 a limited run of novelty flamethrowers designed and branded by The Boring Company.</p>
<p>It was a scheme that had produced results earlier that year. Musk raised $1 million just weeks after launching sales of a $20 Boring Company hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie,&#8221; Musk told Joe Rogan during an <a href="https://sonix.ai/resources/full-transcript-joe-rogan-experience-elon-musk/">infamous podcast</a> in 2018. &#8220;They have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs, and, like, the kids love that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device uses a standard propane gas canister and is functionally similar to propane torches for melting ice, killing weeds or applying roofing materials. But with its rifle-style stock, pistol grip and sci-fi styling, the Boring Company&#8217;s flamethrower had a very different aesthetic &#8212; more post-apocalyptic party accessory than everyday yard maintenance.</p>
<p>Musk did his best to hype sales, tweeting to his Twitter followers, which numbered about 22 million at the time: &#8220;Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty &#8216;match&#8217; to ignite!&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1005549006573846528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He also threw a launch party in Los Angeles, where Craddock was one of the first 1,000 customers to collect a flamethrower, just before his European trip. &#8220;I removed the gas canister, put the flamethrower in my carry-on, and had no trouble on the flights,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s influence and the appeal of the product provided a winning combination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no intention of going around setting fire to stuff,&#8221; said Richardson. &#8220;I just thought it looked pretty cool, and was something I could potentially flip for a lot more money down the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Boring Company would make 20,000 flamethrowers and sell them at $500 each, netting the young company $10 million.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Not&#8217; a Flamethrower</h2>
<p>The 20,000 flamethrowers quickly sold out, with orders flooding in from around the world. As the shipping date neared, however, The Boring Company realized its scorching new product could also be a legal hot potato.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers,&#8221; Musk told Rogan in 2018. &#8220;So, to solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labelled it, <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower">&#8216;Not a Flamethrower.&#8217; &#8220;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Did it work? Was it effective?&#8221; asked Rogan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think so. Yes,&#8221; Musk replied.</p>
<p>The correct answer was no.</p>

<p>In London, the flamethrower came to the attention of Operation Viper, a rapid response team dedicated to tackling gun crime. Working with customs officials, Viper tracked Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers en route to the nation&#8217;s capital. &#8220;There has been a debate as to whether these are firearms,&#8221; one of the Viper officers wrote in an email to Richardson. &#8220;Similar flamethrowers have been seized right across London.&#8221; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringCompany/comments/9jqx36/i_was_arrested_in_the_uk_for_ordering_a/">One Londoner</a> had his laptop and several cellphones confiscated along with the flamethrower.</p>
<p>Flamethrower raids were also happening around the U.K. and across Europe. A YouTube vlogger in Manchester was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/police-obtain-search-warrant-for-syndicates-home-for-elon-musk-flamethrower-218232/">targeted by police</a> after featuring the Boring Company&#8217;s gadget in one of his videos, while up to <a href="https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/not-a-flamethrower-von-elon-musk-spielzeug-oder-waffenimitat-ld.1507777">1,000 purchasers in Switzerland</a> had devices confiscated and were issued fines. One took his case to court, saying the flamethrower was little different from a school Bunsen burner. He lost.</p>
<h2>Not just a European problem</h2>
<p>Without the immediacy of a Customs check, the backlash to Musk&#8217;s flamethrowers in the United States took longer to arrive. But in June 2019, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate introduced a bill that would criminalize owning and using Musk&#8217;s flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Boring Company released a new flamethrower&#8230; without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s1637">reads S1637</a>. &#8220;This bill establishes that owning and using a flamethrower is a criminal act, unless it is used for agricultural, construction or historical collection purposes. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not every police force believes that new laws are necessary &#8212; finding that existing ones are enough. In June 2020, police in Springfield, Massachusetts <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/06/08/springfield-flamethrower-brandon-mcgee-elon-musk-the-boring-company/">stopped a car</a> for a missing inspection sticker. One of the officers noticed what he thought was a rifle hidden beneath a seat &#8212; actually a Boring Company flamethrower. Its owner, passenger Brandon McGee, was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon and an &#8220;infernal machine&#8221; (a device for endangering life or property using fire).</p>
<p>The same month, FBI agents executing a search warrant against a Pennsylvania man, Brandon Althof Long, stumbled across his Boring Company flamethrower propped against a wall. Long had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to riot and cause civil disorder, and conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony, during riots in Ohio protesting police brutality.</p>
<p>The agents seized the flamethrower out of concern for their safety, which a U.S. district judge later ruled lawful. &#8220;Other individuals could be located inside the house and the flamethrower could have been used to endanger officers as they retreated from Long&#8217;s home,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Novel items like flamethrowers are rarely specified in law, says <a href="https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/faculty/calo-ryan">Ryan Calo</a>, a law professor and co-founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. &#8220;Some items &#8211; like guns or spring knives &#8211; are weapons &#8216;per se,&#8217; meaning that they are always weapons. But most statutes have an &#8216;or other deadly weapon&#8217; clause as well, meaning that anything that is capable of causing serious bodily harm, even a rock, can be a weapon in the right circumstances,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The problem is, what circumstances? A flame-spouting weed-killer might not attract the interest of police, whereas a similar device styled like an assault rifle is more likely to be considered threatening. &#8220;And if you use the item during the commission of another crime, this can lead to a distinct offense of using a deadly weapon to commit a felony,&#8221; said Calo.</p>
<p>For all Musk&#8217;s portrayal of the Not a Flamethrower as just an entertaining toy, police forces &#8212; and criminals &#8212; in North America are increasingly treating them as dangerous weapons. In rural Wisconsin, a two-year narcotics investigation led police to arrest two men in July 2020 with a hoard of drugs, cash and weapons. Among the cocaine, pistols and assault rifles prominently displayed in the traditional seizure photo was a Boring Company flamethrower.

<p>No company has complete control over what customers do with its products. However, this isn&#8217;t the first time a product connected to Musk has been misused.</p>
<p>Tesla, the electric automaker led by Musk, has been criticized for naming its advanced driver assistant system Autopilot and for calling the $10,000 add-on option Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though the driver must remain engaged at all times and is legally liable. A German court has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/">banned the company</a> from using the terms &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; or &#8220;full potential for autonomous driving&#8221; on its website or in other marketing materials.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F8tz78dZ1D"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/">Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminology</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/elon-musk-rails-against-german-court-decision-on-tesla-autopilot-terminology/embed/#?secret=F8tz78dZ1D" data-secret="F8tz78dZ1D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Safety advocates have argued that using terms like Autopilot and FSD misrepresents the capabilities of the system. The name, along with the lack of an in-cabin camera that monitors the driver, has led owners to push well beyond the bounds of the system.</p>
<p>Videos showing Tesla owners misusing Autopilot and FSD abound on YouTube. Some have had run-ins with law enforcement. One Canadian man was charged for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54197344">sleeping in his Tesla</a> as it drove down the highway.</p>

<p>John Richardson eventually got his Not a Flamethrower back from the Metropolitan police. He now intends to keep it out of the public eye, at least until it&#8217;s worth selling. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to sit on it for however long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if there is a zombie apocalypse, at least I&#8217;ve got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, Craddock remains the only person that TechCrunch can identify as having been incarcerated solely for possessing a Not a Flamethrower. &#8220;It was a hair-raising experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the middle of nowhere in Sardinia, on 24-hour lockdown with an older guy giving off Mafia vibes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After nearly a week in prison, Craddock was abruptly handed his belongings (flamethrower aside) and set free. &#8220;My lawyer asked the judge, &#8216;Do you really want to be the guy on international news keeping an American in jail over this toy?&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that was the key to getting me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craddock took the first plane home. He says he now regrets taking the flamethrower abroad, and carrying it in public: &#8220;I would have preferred not to have spent that week in an Italian prison, but now I&#8217;ve got a hell of a story.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also has another flamethrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I got back, I built myself a new one,&#8221; said Craddock. &#8220;You can follow YouTube videos with links to all the things you need. It&#8217;s pretty simple.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podchaser.com/">Podchaser</a>, a startup building what it calls &#8220;IMDB for podcasts,&#8221; recently announced that it has raised $4 million in a funding round led by Greycroft.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a site where — similar to <a href="https://www.imdb.com">the Amazon-owned Internet Movie Database</a> — users can look up who&#8217;s appeared in which podcasts, rate and review those podcasts and add them to lists. In fact, CEO Bradley Davis told me that the startup&#8217;s &#8220;vibrant, exciting community of podcast nerds&#8221; have already created 8.5 million podcast credits in the database.</p>
<p>Davis said this is something he simply wanted to exist and was, in fact, convinced that it had to exist already. When he realized that it didn&#8217;t, he posted on Reddit asking whether anyone was willing to build the company with him — which is how he connected with his eventual co-founder and CTO Ben Slinger in Australia. (Podchaser is a fully distributed company, with Davis currently based in Oklahoma City.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, Davis doesn&#8217;t think podcast nerds are the only ones taking advantage of the listings. Instead, he suggested that it&#8217;s useful for anyone looking to learn more about podcasts and discover new ones, with Podchaser&#8217;s monthly active users quintupling over the past year.</p>
<p>For example, he said that one of the most popular pages is politician <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/creators/pete-buttigieg-107ZztJDdR">Pete Buttigieg&#8217;s profile</a>, where visitors don&#8217;t just learn about Buttigieg&#8217;s own podcast but see others on which he&#8217;s appeared. (You can also use Podchaser to learn more about TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/equity-508514">Equity</a>, <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/techcrunch-mixtape-592290">Mixtape</a> and <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/original-content-547492">Original Content</a> podcasts, though those profiles could stand to be filled out a bit more.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/">Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/chartable-seed-funding/embed/#?secret=uhZrdLVRDq" data-secret="uhZrdLVRDq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There has been endless discussion about how to fix podcast discovery, and while Davis isn&#8217;t claiming that Podchaser will solve it wholesale, he thinks it can be part of the solution — not just through its own database, but through the broader <a href="https://podcasttaxonomy.com">Podcast Taxonomy</a> project that it&#8217;s organizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we are successful at standardizing a lot of the terminology, and if we do an analysis of all podcasts, of how popular they are, that [will help many listeners] to cull and find the good stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Podchaser plans to add new features that will further encourage user contributions, like a gamification system and a discussion system.</p>
<p>While the consumer site is free, the startup recently launched a paid product called <a href="https://www.podchaser.com/pro">Podchaser Pro</a>, which provides reach and demographic data across 1.8 million podcasts. It also monetizes by providing podcast players with access to its credits through an API.</p>
<p>Davis said the startup was &#8220;lucky&#8221; that it decided to build a database that&#8217;s &#8220;agnostic&#8221; from any specific podcast player.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we had a lot of latitude to work with those platforms, we integrate with many of those platforms and you’re going to see a lot of our credits showing up [in podcast players],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Greycroft, Advancit Capital, LightShed Ventures, Powerhouse Capital, High Alpha, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Poplar Ventures also participated in the round, as did TrendKite founder A.J. Bruno, Ad Results Media CEO Marshall Williams and Shamrock Capital Partner Mike LaSalle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in the face of a pandemic, the podcast market continues to grow at a breakneck pace,&#8221; said Greycroft co-founder and chairman Alan Patricof in a statement. &#8220;The demand from consumers and brands is insatiable. Podchaser’s data and discovery tools are crucial to taking podcasting to new heights.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.adthena.com">Adthena</a> is expanding its partnership with market research company Kantar by acquiring Kantar&#8217;s paid search business.</p>
<p>The two companies <a href="https://www.research-live.com/article/news/kantar_and_adthena_launch_search_intelligence_partnership/id/5078462">announced an agreement earlier this month</a>, through which Adthena data will be integrated into Kantar&#8217;s ad intelligence product. Now, through this new acquisition, Adthena said Kantar search clients will get access to the Adthena product suite.</p>
<p>Kantar moved into the paid search business in 2012 by <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121221005332/en/Kantar-Media-Acquires-AdGooroo">acquiring AdGooroo</a> (not surprisingly, it eventually rebranded the offering).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As search continues to become the barometer by which all advertising efforts are measured, the importance of having access to the best intelligence possible cannot be understated,” said Adthena CEO Ian O’Rourke in a statement. “And this acquisition of Kantar’s paid search assets, in combination with our Kantar partnership, will enable us to break new ground for brands and agencies while also helping us to continue upon our growth trajectory.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/adthena-united-states/">O&#8217;Rourke previously told me</a> that Adthena stands out thanks to its &#8220;whole market view,&#8221; using artificial intelligence to create visualizations of all the keywords in paid and organic search used to find a business and their competitors.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Adthena confirmed that some Kantar team members will be joining the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based construction startup TraceAir today announced a $3.5 million Series A. Led by London-based XTX Ventures, this round brings the company’s total funding up to $7 million. The raise includes existing investor Metropolis VC, along with new additions Liquid 2 Ventures, GEM Capital, GPS Ventures and Andrew Filev.</p>
<p>We first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/our-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-17th-batch/slide/11/">noted the company back in 2016</a>, when it pitched a method for using drones to spot construction errors before they become too expense. It’s a pretty massive field that various technology companies are attempting to solve through a variety of different means, ranging from quadrupedal robots to site-scanning hard hats.</p>
<p>Last February, TraceAir announced a new drone management tool. “Haul Router provides the best mathematically objective hauls for each given drone scan,” the company noted at the time. “Any employee can use the tool to design a haul road and export the results to feed into grading equipment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic has thrown the construction industry for a loop (along with countless others). But unlike other sectors, demand still remains high in many places. TraceAir is hoping its solution will prove beneficial as many outfits seek a way to continue the process in spite of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“The Covid-19 pandemic created new challenges for the U.S. and worldwide construction industries, resulting in delayed projects and growing unemployment rates,” CEO Dmitry Korolev said in a release tied to the news. “Our platform allows industry leaders to manage projects more efficiently and collaborate with their teams remotely, minimizing the need for a physical presence on-site.”</p>
<p>TraceAir says the additional funding will go toward its sales and marketing, along with future product developments, including an unnamed product set for release this quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every picture posted to Facebook and Instagram gets a caption generated by an image analysis AI, and that AI just got a lot smarter. <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-people/">The improved system</a> should be a treat for visually impaired users, and may help you find your photos faster in the future.</p>
<p>Alt text is a field in an image&#8217;s metadata that describes its contents: &#8220;A person standing in a field with a horse,&#8221; or &#8220;a dog on a boat.&#8221; This lets the image be understood by people who can&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>These descriptions are often added manually by a photographer or publication, but people uploading photos to social media generally don&#8217;t bother, if they even have the option. So the relatively recent ability to automatically generate one — the technology has only just gotten good enough in the last couple years — has been extremely helpful in making social media more accessible in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9osJmffyHu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/ava-expands-its-ai-captioning-to-desktop-and-web-apps-and-raises-4-5m-to-scale/">Ava expands its AI captioning to desktop and web apps, and raises $4.5M to scale</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ava expands its AI captioning to desktop and web apps, and raises $4.5M to scale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/ava-expands-its-ai-captioning-to-desktop-and-web-apps-and-raises-4-5m-to-scale/embed/#?secret=9osJmffyHu" data-secret="9osJmffyHu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook created its Automatic Alt Text system in 2016, which is eons ago in the field of machine learning. The team has since cooked up many improvements to it, making it faster and more detailed, and the latest update adds an option to generate a more detailed description on demand.</p>
<p>The improved system recognizes 10 times more items and concepts than it did at the start, now around 1,200. And the descriptions include more detail. What was once &#8220;Two people by a building&#8221; may now be &#8220;A selfie of two people by the Eiffel Tower.&#8221; (The actual descriptions hedge with &#8220;may be&#8230;&#8221; and will avoid including wild guesses.)</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more detail than that, even if it&#8217;s not always relevant. For instance, in this image the AI notes the relative positions of the people and objects:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098299" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098299" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2098299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg" alt="The Facebook smartphone app showing detailed captions for an image." width="1024" height="688" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=1536,1032 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=2048,1375 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/facebook-caption.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2098299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Obviously the people are above the drums, and the hats are above the people, none of which really needs to be said for someone to get the gist. But consider an image described as &#8220;A house and some trees and a mountain.&#8221; Is the house on the mountain or in front of it? Are the trees in front of or behind the house, or maybe on the mountain in the distance?</p>
<p>In order to adequately describe the image, these details should be filled in, even if the general idea can be gotten across with fewer words. If a sighted person wants more detail they can look closer or click the image for a bigger version — someone who can&#8217;t do that now has a similar option with this &#8220;generate detailed image description&#8221; command. (Activate it with a long press in the Android app or a custom action in iOS.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the new description would be something like &#8220;A house and some trees in front of a mountain with snow on it.&#8221; That paints a better picture, right? (To be clear, these examples are made up, but it&#8217;s the sort of improvement that&#8217;s expected.)</p>
<p>The new detailed description feature will come to Facebook first for testing, though the improved vocabulary will appear on Instagram soon. The descriptions are also kept simple so they can be easily translated to other languages already supported by the apps, though the feature may not roll out in other countries simultaneously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is always in search of a better way to instantly connect users to something to watch, instead of having them waste time unsuccessfully scrolling through all the available programming options. Now, the company says a recent test focused on solving this problem, Shuffle Play, has proven popular enough to roll out to all users worldwide.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">the streamer&#8217;s Q4 2020 earnings</a>, announced today, Netflix noted the product development only briefly. It referred broadly to a test of a new feature that &#8220;gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse.&#8221; It also noted the feature would reach all users worldwide sometime in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch the test in question is Shuffle Play, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">which we first covered back in August 2020</a>. However, the company tells us the actual name of the feature is something that&#8217;s still being tested.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shuffle Play puts a big button right on the Netflix home screen, beneath your profile icon. When clicked, Netflix randomly plays content its personalization algorithms think you&#8217;ll like. This could include a movie you&#8217;re currently watching, something you&#8217;ve saved to your watch list or a title that&#8217;s similar to something you&#8217;ve already watched, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sRUh1EToYV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">Netflix shares soar as it passes 200M paying subscribers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix shares soar as it passes 200M paying subscribers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/embed/#?secret=sRUh1EToYV" data-secret="sRUh1EToYV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A variation has also been spotted in the TV app&#8217;s sidebar navigation. More recently, we&#8217;ve found this sidebar option relabeled as &#8220;Shuffle Play,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Play Something&#8221; as before.</p>
<p>In addition, as you start scrolling down through the Netflix home screen on the TV, you&#8217;ll eventually come across a screen that explains what the option is for and points to the new button with a red arrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sure what to watch?&#8221; this page asks, before explaining how Shuffle Play works.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098323" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098323" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png 3712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=1536,935 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=2048,1246 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7821.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098323" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The button has already appeared on some users&#8217; Netflix app for TV devices, due to the ongoing tests.</p>
<p>In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said the user response to Shuffle Play has been positive &#8212; which is funny because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">the original responses to the feature on social media</a> were decidedly mixed. However, the company doesn&#8217;t make its decisions based on what a <a href="https://twitter.com/SiphokaziKayana/status/1293980088892100612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293980088892100612%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">handful</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/kgdobs/status/1293069402338820096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293069402338820096%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">tweets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stylesperiodt/status/1295667352676126720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295667352676126720%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">once</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerLevison/status/1295543859141844992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1295543859141844992%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fnetflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen%2F">said</a>, but rather in how Netflix members actually used the product, of course.</p>
<p>Netflix also tells us the feature is still being tested only on TV devices, not other platforms like web or mobile. It declined to say how many users or what percentage had been opted into the test to date.</p>
<p>Shuffle Play is the latest in a long series of tests where Netflix has tried to make it easier to find something to watch right away.</p>
<p>In 2019, for example, Netflix tried out a shuffle mode that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/netflix-says-its-testing-a-shuffle-feature-for-when-you-dont-know-what-to-watch/">let you click on a popular show to start playing a random episode</a>. This may have worked well when users wanted to play a random episode of <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-mov-netflix-the-office-0705-20190703-fjlo4pkt5jb7llpo2aixl7o2pe-story.html">their default pick</a>, like the “The Office” or “Friends,” but Netflix has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/nbc-pulling-office-netflix-2021-n1021791">lost</a> <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1107124/how-to-survive-friends-leaving-netflix-they-re-still-there-for-you">both.</a></p>
<p>It has also promoted its shows on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/16/netflix-experiments-with-promoting-its-shows-on-the-login-screen/">the login screen</a> and as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/netflix-adds-a-screensaver-to-its-tv-apps-to-promote-its-original-content/">screensavers</a>, and notoriously autoplayed previews until last year, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/">finally caved in to user demand</a> for a way to turn this off.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yH1YH28Go0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/">Netflix’s horrible autoplay previews can be turned off</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix’s horrible autoplay previews can be turned off&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/netflixs-horrible-autoplay-previews-can-be-turned-off/embed/#?secret=yH1YH28Go0" data-secret="yH1YH28Go0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Overall, the goal is to make the Netflix experience closer to that of traditional TV, where you could switch the set on and content just started playing.</p>
<p>Netflix says Shuffle Play will roll out globally in the first half of 2021, but didn&#8217;t share more specifics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Qualtrics debut is going to be huge, and that matters. Can the bankers get its IPO price closer to what retail investors are willing to pay?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, Qualtrics dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828021000498/qualtricss-1a2.htm">new S-1 filing</a>, this time detailing its proposed IPO pricing. That means we can now get a good look at how much the company may be worth when it goes public later this month.</p>
<p>The debut has been one TechCrunch has been looking forward to since the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/">announced</a> that it would be spun out from its erstwhile corporate parent, SAP. In 2019, the Germany-based enterprise giant SAP snatched up Qualtrics for $8 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">just before it was to go public</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Qualtrics is either worth less than we would have guessed, or its first IPO range feels light.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That figure provides a good marker for how well SAP has done with the deal and how much value Qualtrics has generated in the intervening years. Keep in mind, however, that the value of software companies has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">risen greatly</a> in the last few years, so the numbers we&#8217;ll see below benefit from a market-wide repricing of recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Qualtrics estimates that it may be worth $22 to $26 per share when it goes public. Is that a lot? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Qualtrics&#8217; first IPO range</h2>
<p>First, scale. Qualtrics is selling just under 50 million shares in its public offering. As you can math out, at more than $20 per share, the company is looking to raise north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>After going public, Qualtrics anticipates having 510,170,610 shares outstanding, inclusive of its 7.4 million underwriter option. Using that simple share count, Qualtrics would be worth $11.2 billion to $13.3 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix capped off a year of impressive streaming growth by adding 8.5 million net new paying subscribers during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>That means the streaming giant now has a total of 204 million paying subscribers worldwide — net growth of 37 million new subscribers for the full year, up from 28 million net additions in 2019.</p>
<p>The company also <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">reported</a> that it brought in $6.64 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $1.19 during Q4, compared to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX"> analyst predictions</a> of $6.63 billon in revenue and EPS of $1.39.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In response to the earnings report, Netflix shares were up 12.4% in after-hours trading (as of 4:43 p.m. Eastern).</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Netflix projected that it will add 6.0 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2021 — the same as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/netflix-growth-q3/">old forecast for Q4</a>, and less than half the 15.8 million subscribers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/neflix-q1-earnings/">Netflix added in Q1 2020</a> (right as lockdowns were beginning in the United States).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The company&#8217;s investor letter also highlights a number of hit titles from the quarter, projecting that 72 million households will &#8220;choose to watch&#8221; (watch at least two minutes of) &#8220;The Midnight Sky&#8221; in its first 28 days of release, while 68 million households chose to watch &#8220;Holidate.&#8221; It also said the most recent season of &#8220;The Crown&#8221; was its most popular yet, with more than 100 million households choosing to watch the show &#8220;since its initial launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to titles with big viewership, we also aspire to have hits that become part of the cultural zeitgeist,&#8221; Netflix said. &#8220;In 2020 alone, we had ​&#8217;Tiger King,​&#8217; &#8216;​Bridgerton​&#8217; and ​&#8217;The Queen’s Gambit​.&#8217; &#8230; In fact, Netflix series accounted for nine out of the 10 most searched shows globally in 2020, while our films represented two of the top 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company acknowledged growing competition from new(-ish) streaming services like Disney+, Peacock and HBO Max, but its user numbers still put it far ahead of any streaming competition — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney+, for example, had 86.8 million subscribers</a> as of early December (Disney&#8217;s service launched a little over a year ago and is still rolling out globally).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy is simple: if we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment,&#8221; Netflix said. &#8220;This past year is a testament to this approach. Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history.&#8221;</p>
<p>EMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom made a similar point in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netflix ended 2020 on a high note, adding over 36 million subscribers and passing 200 million subscribers. Despite increasing competition from Disney and others, Netflix had its strongest year yet and will look to grow further in 2021, with a strong content release slate already planned. So far, Netflix has been a clear winner of the streaming wars.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[When should deep-tech companies hire marketers, and do these hires need industry experience?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deep tech startups develop cutting-edge innovations with the power to truly revolutionize society. The founding team members at these companies often come from deeply technical backgrounds, which powers rapid product progress but can create bottlenecks on the go-to-market side.</p>
<p>In this post, I outline the answers to four key questions around marketing at early-stage deep tech companies that are post-revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What marketing teams at deep tech companies do.</li>
<li>When to hire the marketing team.</li>
<li>Whether the marketing team needs industry experience.</li>
<li>How to source and evaluate talent for the marketing team.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this post, deep tech startups can formulate their marketing hiring strategy and attract and cultivate top talent to drive their go-to-market plan. Without business execution, even the most groundbreaking innovations do not achieve their intended impact.</p>
<h2><strong>What do marketing teams at deep tech companies do? </strong></h2>
<p>To set the context, I share below the typical projects of deep tech marketing teams, which look different from marketing in other industries given the greater product focus and complexity, regulatory oversight and longer time to market.</p>
<h3><strong>Go-to-market</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers leverage the strength of the IP to establish collaborations with large companies, such as pharma companies and institutions, such as the government, universities or hospitals. To this end, marketers develop creative ways to gather lists of, and information on, key contacts at these potential partners. They also build sales collateral, such as demo videos, pitch decks and one-pagers, to more effectively reach and build long-term relationships with these prospects.</p>
<p>More broadly, marketers also develop the go-to-market strategy beyond partnerships. To this end, marketers conduct in-depth market research on business models, monetization strategies and reimbursement channels.</p>
<h3><strong>Communications</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers create original content to establish the company as a thought leader, build the company’s brand credibility through social media and apply for awards and honors to validate the potential of the company’s solution.</p>
<h3><strong>Forecasting</strong></h3>
<p>Marketers work with finance and product teams to formulate projections as the company moves into the clinical phase.</p>
<h2><strong>When should deep tech companies hire marketers?</strong></h2>
<p>The CEO and other members of the founding team take on marketing work in the formation stage to better understand and empathize with the needs, capabilities and opportunities in the department before bringing someone on full time.</p>
<p>Once the product shows signs of repeatable revenue, a marketing lead is needed. Specifically, this is ahead of a large Series A round, after a small Series A round or when a commercial partner has expressed interest in larger, long-term contracts. Instead of the typical chief marketing officer or chief revenue officer title, deep tech startups call this person a chief commercial officer or chief partnerships officer.</p>
<p>For additional support in the formation stage, companies bring on MBA interns and work with their investors. Prior to the Series A, platform teams at deep tech venture-capital funds are hands-on in helping with marketing through actually doing marketing projects for their portfolio companies, ideating on long-term marketing strategy with the founders through regular feedback sessions and connecting founders with vetted marketing contractors or agencies.</p>
<p>For companies that require FDA approval, commercial advisors, consultants and board members fully take on the partnership strategy work (which represents the bulk of the marketing needs) prior to the Series A round. Similarly, external consultants, such as marketing agencies, can take over major projects like launch strategy. External consultants can then join the team should their performance be strong.</p>
<p>For drug-development companies, the marketing leader is most crucial when the company enters the clinical phase and prepares for trials, regardless of funding stage.</p>
<h2><strong>Do marketing hires need industry experience? </strong></h2>
<p>Of course, it is ideal to hire someone with experience selling into the space and someone who is comfortable with the complex supply chains and long sales cycles. However, if the choice is between someone with functional expertise but no industry expertise and someone with industry experience but limited or no functional expertise, it is better to hire the former candidate and leverage the rest of the team for domain expertise. Deep tech is a niche area, so the other team members can support the marketer in developing industry expertise.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.micromobility.com/">Bolt Mobility</a>, the Miami-based micromobility startup co-founded by Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt, is expanding to 48 new markets after acquiring the assets of Last Mile Holdings.</p>
<p>Bolt Mobility&#8217;s rise and Last Mile&#8217;s demise captures the uncertainty that plagued micromobility companies in the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic upended business models that were, in some cases, already on shaky ground.</p>
<p>Bolt Mobility and Last Mile were both negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bolt Mobility, for instance, had to shut down in several markets in early 2020 due to the pandemic. The company rebounded after it tweaked its business model and began to partner with local operators, added GM&#8217;s former VP global design Ed Welburn as an adviser and came out with a new scooter equipped with dual brakes, 10-inch wheels, LED lights, swappable batteries with 25 miles of range and NanoSeptic surfaces on its handlebars and brake levers designed to rid these common contact points of germs and bacteria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last Mile Holdings didn&#8217;t fare as well.</p>
<p>If Last Mile Holdings doesn&#8217;t sound familiar, the brands it once owned might. Last Mile was a holding company that owned the OjO Electric scooters and Gotcha Mobility, which had a portfolio of electric trikes, scooters and bikes. The company acquired Gotcha in a $12 million cash and stock deal that closed in March 2020.</p>
<p>As Bolt Mobility grew, with its customer base hitting 300,000 users in 2020, Last Mile hit headwinds. Last Mile Holdings, which traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under MILE, ended up selling its U.S. assets in an auction. Bolt Mobility acquired substantially all of the assets of the company for a credit bid of $3 million, according to a filing at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Those assets include 8,500 new devices, including e-scooters, e-bikes, pedal bikes and sit-down cruisers and licenses to operate in 48 new markets, the majority of which (more than 30) are exclusive contracts, according to Bolt CEO Ignacio Tzoumas. The 48 new markets include 18 university campuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition represents a significant expansion for Bolt on all fronts,&#8221; Tzoumas said, adding that the company brought on former Gotcha Chief Operating Officer Matt Tolan, who will now serve as Bolt&#8217;s chief commercial officer, as well as about 20 team members who were formerly a part of Gotcha&#8217;s tech and operations teams.</p>
<p>Riders in Bolt&#8217;s new markets will continue to be able to access and use the e-scooters, e-bikes and pedal bikes through the Gotcha Mobility and Ojo Electric iOS and Android mobile apps. Bolt is working with cities and universities to transition these markets to Bolt&#8217;s platform. The acquisition adds e-bikes to the Bolt platform for the first time. Although, the company was already developing its own line of e-bikes that it plans to launch later this year.</p>

<p>Bolt credits its new business model for helping it survive and even thrive in 2020. Instead of continuing to handle the complex and expensive task of fleet management and operations, Bolt decided to partner with local companies. These partners operate <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bolt’s fleets on the ground in each individual market. This customizable approach allowed for a business partnership model in select markets where Bolt leased scooters to delivery workers, restaurants and other small businesses, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">By July, Bolt and its partners were operating in five new or re-launched markets. Bolt also has a backlog of agreements with partners for an additional 20 markets that the acquisition is primed to fulfill, according to the company. </span></p>
<p>Tzoumas said Bolt was able to execute the deal without taking on any additional debt, and &#8220;under terms that will allow us to continue devoting our resources to expanding and improving our services in all of the markets where we operate.&#8221; The acquisition was funded in part by Fuel Venture Capital, an existing Bolt investor.  Bolt is also backed by Sofreh Capital and The Yucaipa Companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded Bolt because we believe in micromobility as a movement that can transform the way people live and move within their communities,&#8221; Usain Bolt said in a statement. &#8220;This expansion proves that anything is possible for micromobility when you support it with talented people, innovative technology, and the incredible work ethic of the Bolt team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s next spacecraft is in development in Texas, and CEO Elon Musk previously revealed that the company was planning to build floating spaceports for Starship operations, after a job ad was posted looking for someone to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/spacex-to-build-floating-spaceports-for-rockets-bound-for-the-moon-and-mars-and-for-hypersonic-earth-travel/">oversee their development</a>. Now, SpaceX has purchased two oil rigs to convert for this purpose, as first reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/nextspaceflight/status/1351442201134264321?s=20">spaceflight.com&#8217;s Michael Baylor</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/spacex-bought-former-valaris-oil-rigs-to-build-starship-launchpads.html">confirmed by CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>The rigs have been named Deimos and Phoibos by SpaceX, which are the names of the two moons of Mars (and the names of the gods of both dread and fear in Greek mythology before that). The rigs were originally designed for offshore deepwater drilling, up to a maximum depth of 8,500 feet. They&#8217;re currently located in Brownsville, a port city on the Gulf of Mexico near SpaceX&#8217;s Starship development site in Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>These vessels measure 240 feet by 255 feet and will in theory be repurposed to support launching of Starship (and perhaps return landing, given their reusable design). Thus far, SpaceX has been launching and landing its Starship prototypes on land at its Boca Chica site, though it&#8217;s only done lower altitude flights so far. The company also operates two drone ships, which are 300 feet long by around 170 feet wide, as autonomous floating landing pads for its current Falcon 9 rocket boosters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX also posted another ad seeking a resort development manager to turn its south Texas facility into a &#8220;21st century spaceport,&#8221; specifically looking for someone with resort expertise. Meanwhile, Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/elon-musk-has-made-the-move-to-texas/">confirmed that he has moved to Texas last December</a>, following a number of public suggestions that he would do so owing in part to California&#8217;s taxation and regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Musk&#8217;s other company Tesla also selected Austin as the site of its next gigafactory in the U.S., intended for assembly of its Cybertruck, Model Y and Tesla Semi, as well as Model 3 cars destined for customers on the east coast. SpaceX has maintained engine test facilities in McGreger, Texas, and set up Boca Chica as one of two Starship development sites alongside Florida, before making the south Texas location the sole focus for that spacecraft&#8217;s construction and testing after consolidating its efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new music platform, <a href="https://uppbeat.io/">Uppbeat</a>, aims to make it easier for YouTubers and other content creators to find quality free music to use in their videos. The system, which is designed to navigate the complexities of copyright claims while also fairly compensating artists, offers an alternative to existing free music platforms, including YouTube&#8217;s own Audio Library and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/arts-culture/arts-culture-resources/legalmusicforvideos/">Creative Commons&#8217;</a> legal music for videos, for example.</p>
<p>The idea for the startup comes from Lewis Foster and Matt Russell, the U.K.-based co-founders of another music-licensing company, <a href="https://musicvine.com/">Music Vine</a>, which has been operating for about six years.</p>
<p>Last year, the co-founders realized there was a growing opportunity to address the creator space with a slightly different product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We were realizing, more and more, was that the creator space &#8212; YouTubers, streamers, podcasters &#8212; has become enormous, but there wasn&#8217;t a music platform that was doing a nice job for those type of users,&#8221; explains Foster. &#8220;So we sat down and thought about what the perfect music resource would look like for creators. That led to deciding to build Uppbeat,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>They began developing the Uppbeat website in September 2020 and launched it to the public on Monday.</p>
<p>On the creators&#8217; side, Uppbeat&#8217;s key focus is on eliminating headaches over copyright claims, particularly on YouTube.</p>
<p>Currently, if a YouTuber gets a copyright claim over music in their video, it can cause them to lose income. Though YouTube has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/youtube-shuts-down-music-companies-use-of-manual-copyright-claims-to-steal-creator-revenue/">worked to address</a> this problem over the years with new features and changes to its Content ID match system, it&#8217;s still an issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a YouTuber gets a copyright claim, [YouTube] can de-monetize their video. And if they go through YouTube&#8217;s dispute system, it can take as long as 30 days for it to get resolved. It&#8217;s a pretty big frustration for YouTubers,&#8221; Foster says.</p>
<p>Uppbeat&#8217;s music will instead almost instantly clear the claims.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098208" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098208" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098208" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="392" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Uppbeat-Playlists.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098208" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uppbeat</p></div></p>
<p>Similar to Spotify, the Uppbeat website leverages a freemium model, To get started, creators can sign up for a free account that provides access to about 50% of the site&#8217;s roughly 1,000-track music catalog and 10 downloads per month. The paid plan offers full catalog access and no download limit.</p>
<p>Free users simply add a credit to their YouTube video description to clear copyright claims, while paid users are added to an approved list, eliminating this extra step.</p>
<p>Because the tracks have to be fingerprinted to fight off unlicensed usage, a copyright claim will still occur. But instead of taking days or weeks to resolve, it will be cleared within about five minutes, the company says. The Uppbeat system clears the claim by checking the video description for the necessary credit and by checking the claim against its list of paid users. This is all automated, too, which helps to speed things up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2098212" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2098212" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2098212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg 3318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=768,396 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=1536,793 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1057 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-19-at-2.08.07-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2098212" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uppbeat</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the artists&#8217; side, Uppbeat pays as their music is used &#8212; even by the free users.</p>
<p>The revenue from the premium subscriptions, and soon, advertising, is divided between the artists on a monthly basis, in proportion to the number of downloads the artist receives.</p>
<p>&#8220;What that means from the artists&#8217; perspective is, on average, they&#8217;re going to make the same amount from tracks on the premium side as they do on the free side,&#8221; says Lewis. &#8220;It means, even for free usage, they will get paid,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The site will also monetize through audio ads that play as you browse the tracks and listen to the music. (However, these are just promoting the paid plan for the time being.)</p>
<p>Browsing Uppbeat&#8217;s catalog is easy, too. The music is organized by genre, theme and style in colorful rows that aim to introduce all the different types of music and beats a YouTuber may need. For example, there&#8217;s music customized for use  in the background and other tracks that cater to different moods like inspiring, calm, happy, dramatic and more. A catalog of SFX (sound effects) is expected to be added in a few months, too.</p>
<p>Uppbeat believes its existing music industry connections with producers, composers and songwriters via Music Vine will help them to source higher-quality tracks than other free music services.</p>
<p>At present, the startup is self-funded through revenues from Music Vine, but Foster says they&#8217;ve had some VC interest. For now, though, the founders are looking to keep the ownership in-house, for the most part.</p>
<p>However, Uppbeat is experimenting with both a referral program and a profit-sharing scheme. The latter will allow YouTubers who bring Uppbeat new customers, then take the full revenue from those customers for two years&#8217; time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking a massive sacrifice,&#8221; Foster admits. &#8220;But from from our perspective, the faster we can get Uppbeat out there and well-known in the YouTuber space, then we&#8217;re happy to share that [revenue]. We think it&#8217;s a cool idea to share that within the YouTuber community, rather than [take] a big private investment,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>The startup is also considering making shares in the company available to some larger YouTubers, Foster adds.</p>
<p>Today, Uppbeat is a team of eight employees and 12 freelancers, based in Leeds, U.K.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Volta builds and operates a network of electric vehicle charging stations that are sited in parking lots around grocery stores, pharmacy chains, banks and hospitals.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The company has placed its charging stations, with their 55-inch digital displays in locations at 200 cities across 23 states, according to a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The charge is free for vehicle owners and is supported by the retailers and consumer goods companies that want to reach the EV audience.</p>
<p>With the new financing, Volta has now raised over $200 million in funding and intends to use its cash to begin expanding internationally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Companies who have placed Volta&#8217;s chargers on their sites include Albertsons Companies, Giant Food, Regency Centers, Wegmans and TopGolf. Brands advertising on the company&#8217;s screens include GM, Hulu, Nestlé, Polestar, Porsche and Unilever.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since our initial investment in Volta in 2018, excitement and interest in electrification &#8212; and specifically solving for public charging solutions &#8212; has continued to gain momentum,&#8221; said John Tough, managing partner at Energize Ventures, a major and existing investor in this round. &#8220;Our conviction in this team has similarly grown, and we believe Volta is poised to lead this market as the most capital-efficient and highly utilized EV charging network in the country.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union is preparing the ground for vaccine passports. A common approach for mutual recognition of vaccination documentation is of the &#8220;utmost importance,&#8221; the commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-united-front-beat-covid-19_en.pdf">said today</a>, adding that it wants &#8220;an appropriate trust framework&#8221; to be agreed upon by the end of January &#8212; &#8220;to allow member states’ certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccination certificates allow for a clear record of each individual’s vaccination history, to ensure the right medical follow-up as well as the monitoring of possible adverse effects,&#8221; it writes, adding that: &#8220;A common EU approach to trusted, reliable and verifiable certificates would allow people to use their records in other member states. Though it is premature to envisage the use of vaccine certificates for other purposes than health protection, an EU approach may facilitate other cross-border applications of such certificates in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what form (or forms) these pan-EU coronavirus vaccine certificates will take as yet &#8212; but presumably there will be both paper-based and digital formats, to ensure accessibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nor is it clear exactly how EU citizens&#8217; identity and medical data will be protected as checks on vaccination status take place. Or, indeed, who the trusted entities storing and managing sensitive health data will be. All that detail is to come &#8212; and may well vary by member state, depending on how immunity certification verification systems get implemented.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/">Last week</a> a number of tech companies, including Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, announced involvement in a separate, cross-industry effort to establish a universal standard for vaccination status that they said would build on existing standards, such as the SMART Health Cards specification that adheres to HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gkmUdKdRsJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/">Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/embed/#?secret=gkmUdKdRsJ" data-secret="gkmUdKdRsJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That tech-backed effort is pushing for an “encrypted digital copy of [a person&#8217;s] immunization credentials to store in a digital wallet of their choice,” with a backup available as a printed QR code that includes W3C-standards verifiable credentials for those not wanting or able to use a smartphone. The PR also talked about a “privacy-preserving health status verification” solution that is at least in part “blockchain-enabled.”</p>
<p>Nothing so specific is being proposed for the common EU approach as yet. And it looks clear that a number of vaccine credential standards will be put forward globally &#8212; as a potential universal standard. (The commission is touting its forthcoming framework on that front too.)</p>
<p>Whatever is devised in the EU must ensure compliance with the region&#8217;s data protection framework (which bakes in requirements for security and privacy by design and default when processing people&#8217;s information). So it could offer better privacy protection than a private sector-led effort, for example.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s eHealth Network &#8212; a body that includes representatives from relevant member states&#8217; authorities who are supported by a wider European Joint Action body, called eHAction &#8212; will be responsible for defining the minimum dataset needed for vaccination certificates used at the EU level, per the commission.</p>
<p>It says this must include &#8220;a unique identifier and an appropriate trust framework ensuring privacy and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expect relevant stakeholders such as Europe&#8217;s Data Protection Supervisor and Data Protection Board to weigh in with expert advice, as happened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/eu-privacy-body-urges-anonymization-of-location-data-for-covid-19-tracking/">last year with coronavirus contacts tracing apps</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The commission will continue to work with member states on vaccination certificates that can be recognised and used in health systems across the EU in full compliance with EU data protection law &#8212; and scaled up globally through the certification systems of the World Health Organisation,&#8221; EU lawmakers add, saying the forthcoming framework will be presented in the WHO &#8220;as a possible universal standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in the challenges ahead for developing privacy-safe vaccination verification, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Lukasz Olejnik</a>, a Europe-based independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher and consultant, told TechCrunch: &#8220;It is tricky to follow privacy by design for this particular [use-case]. It is unclear if anyone will be interested in identifying possible innovative privacy-preserving frameworks such as anonymous cryptographic credentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end perhaps we will end up with some approach using verifiable credentials, but establishing trust will remain a challenge. What will be the source of trust? Is it possible to prove a particular status without the need to disclose the user identity? These are the core questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this proposal will be public and transparent,&#8221; he added of the EU framework.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that all this effort is a bit &#8220;cart before the horse&#8221; at this stage &#8212; being as it&#8217;s still not confirmed whether any of the currently available COVID-19 vaccinations, which have been developed primarily to protect the recipient from serious illness, also prevent transmission of the disease or not.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, systems for verifying proof of immunization status are fast being spun up &#8212; ushering in the possibility of &#8220;vaccine passport&#8221; checks for travelers within the EU down the road, for example. It&#8217;s also not hard to envisage businesses requesting COVID-19 vaccination certification before granting access to a physical facility or service, in a bid to reassure customers they can spend money safety &#8212; i.e., once such documentation exists and can be verified in a standardized way.</p>
<p>Standardized frameworks for vaccination credentials could certainly have very broad implications for personal freedoms in the near future, as well as wide ramifications for privacy &#8212; depending on how these systems are architected, managed and operated.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s privacy and security research community mobilized heavily last year as the pandemic triggered early proposals to develop coronavirus contacts tracing apps &#8212; contributing to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/eu-privacy-experts-push-a-decentralized-approach-to-covid-19-contacts-tracing/">push for exposure notification apps to be decentralized to ensure privacy of individuals&#8217; social graph</a>. However efforts toward establishing vaccination certification systems don&#8217;t appear to have generated the same level of academic engagement as yet.</p>
<p>In an analysis of the implications of immunity certificates, published last month, <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/4350/anytime-and-anywhere-vaccination-immunity-certificates-and-permanent-pandemic">Privacy International</a> warned that any systems that require proof of vaccination for entry or a service would be unfair &#8220;until everyone has access to an effective vaccine&#8221; &#8212; a bar that remains far off indeed.</p>
<p>European countries, which are among the global leaders on COVID-19 vaccination rollouts, have still only immunized tiny minorities of their national populations so far. (Even as the commission today urged member states to set targets to vaccinate a minimum of 80% of health and social care professionals and people over 80 by March 2021; and at least 70% of the total adult population by summer &#8212; targets that look like fantastical wishful thinking right now.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Governments must find alternatives to delivering vaccination schemes that do not perpetuate and reinforce exclusionary and discriminatory practices,&#8221; the rights group further urged, also warning that COVID-19 immunity should not be used as a justification for expanding or instating digital identity schemes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I asked a group of VCs about their approach to mobile content investing and whether new platforms were changing perspectives about mobile-first and desktop-first experiences.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many VCs historically avoided placing bets on hit-driven mobile gaming content in favor of clearer platform opportunities, but as more success stories pop up, the economics overturned conventional wisdom with new business models. As more accessible infrastructure allowed young studios to become more ambitious, venture money began pouring into the gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>After tackling topics including how investors are looking at opportunities in social gaming,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/vcs-discuss-gamings-biggest-infrastructure-investment-opportunities-in-2021/"> infrastructure bets</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/8-investors-discuss-social-gamings-biggest-opportunities/">the moonshots of AR/VR,</a> I asked a group of VCs about their approach to mobile content investing and whether new platforms were changing perspectives about opportunities in mobile-first and desktop-first experiences.</p>
<p>While desktop gaming has evolved dramatically in the past few years as new business models and platforms take hold, to some degree, mobile has been hampered. Investors I chatted with openly worried that some of mobile&#8217;s opportunities were being hamstrung by Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely fearful of Apple’s ability to completely disrupt/affect the growth of a game,&#8221; Bessemer&#8217;s Ethan Kurzweil and Sakib Dadi told TechCrunch. &#8220;We do not foresee that changing any time in the near future despite the outcry from companies such as Epic and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the while, another central focus seems to be the ever-evolving push toward cross-platform gaming, which is getting further bolstered by new technologies. One area of interest for investors: migrating the ambition of desktop titles to mobile and finding ways to build cross-platform experiences that feel fulfilling on devices that are so differently abled performance-wise.</p>
<p>Madrona&#8217;s Hope Cochran, who previously served as CFO of Candy Crush maker King, said mobile still has plenty of untapped opportunities. &#8220;When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responses have been edited for length and clarity. We spoke with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/hope-cochran/">Hope Cochran</a>, managing director, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/daniel-li/">Daniel Li</a>, partner, Madrona Venture Group</li>

<h2 class="iw"><strong><span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="tipatat@thevrfund.com" data-hovercard-owner-id="153">Hope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</span></span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Does it ever get any easier to bet on a gaming content play? What do you look for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope Cochran:</strong> I feel like there are a couple different sectors in gaming. There&#8217;s the actual studios that are developing games and they have several approaches. Are they developing a brand new game, are they reimagining a game from 25 years ago and reskinning it, which is a big trend right now, or are they taking IP that is really trendy right now and trying to create a game around it? There are different ways to predict which ones of those might make it, but then there&#8217;s also the infrastructure behind gaming and then there&#8217;s also identifying trends and which games or studios are embracing those. Those are some of the ways I try to parse it out and figure out which ones I think are going to rise to the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Li:</strong> There&#8217;s this single-player narrative versus multiplayer metaverse and I think people are more comfortable on the metaverse stuff because if you&#8217;re building a social network and seeing good early traction, those things don&#8217;t typically just disappear. Then if you are betting more on individual studios producing games, I think the other thing is we&#8217;re seeing more and more VCs pop up that are just totally games-focused or devoting a portion of the portfolio to games. And for them it&#8217;s okay to have a hits-driven portfolio.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>There seems to be more innovation happening on PC/console in terms of business models and distribution, do you think mobile feels less experimental these days? Why or why not?</b></p>
<p><strong>Hope Cochran:</strong> Mobile is still trying to push the technology forward, the important element of being cross-platform is difficult. When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale. The metrics are also very different for mobile though.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Li:</strong> It seems like the big monetization innovation that has happened over the last couple of years has been the &#8220;battle pass&#8221; type of subscription where you can unlock more content by playing. Obviously that&#8217;s gone over to mobile, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like mobile has had some sort of new monetization unlock. The other thing that&#8217;s happened on desktop is the success of the &#8220;pay $10 or $20 or $20 for this indie game&#8221; type of thing, and it feels like that&#8217;s not going to happen on mobile because of the price points that people are used to paying.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today announced a new editorial franchise called Apple Podcasts Spotlight, which aims to highlight rising podcast creators in the U.S. The editorial team at Apple will select new podcast creators to feature every month and then give them prominent screen real estate in the Apple Podcasts app and promote them across social media and elsewhere. This will allow creators to reach a wider audience, similar to how the App Store showcases a selection of recommended apps and games with large banners at the top of its screen.</p>
<p>The first Spotlight creator is Chelsea Devantez, who hosts the podcast Celebrity Book Club. On Fridays, Chelsea and special guests including Emily V. Gordon, Gabourey Sidibe, Ashley Nicole Black and Lydia Popovich will meet to discuss the memoirs of &#8220;badass celebrity womxn,&#8221; as an <a href="https://medium.com/stitcher-blog/apple-podcasts-names-chelsea-devantez-of-stitchers-celebrity-book-club-as-its-first-ever-e33a21a34fcf">announcement</a> describes it.</p>
<p>The idea for the show began a year ago when Devantez was reading Jessica Simpson&#8217;s memoir and started recapping it on Instagram. The reaction from her followers prompted her to expand the concept into a podcast.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Upcoming episodes will feature Oscar-nominated writer and producer Emily V. Gordon talking Drew Barrymore’s &#8220;Little Girl Lost;&#8221; actress Stephanie Beatriz discussing Celine Dion’s memoir &#8220;My Story My Dream;&#8221; Leighton Meester on Carly Simon’s &#8220;Boys in the Trees;&#8221; and a special Valentine’s Day episode where Chelsea and TikTok star Rob Anderson read Burt Reynolds’ and Loni Anderson’s competing divorce memoirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Podcasts Spotlight helps listeners find some of the world’s best shows by shining a light on creators with singular voices,&#8221; said Ben Cave, Global Head of Business for Apple Podcasts, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;Chelsea Devantez has created a fun, vibrant space with Celebrity Book Club for listeners to gain new perspectives on the celebrities we thought we knew. We are delighted to recognize Chelsea and Celebrity Book Club as our first Spotlight selection and look forward to introducing creators like Chelsea to listeners each month,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Apple says future Spotlight creators will be announced monthly from across a range of podcast genres, formats and locations, and will often focus on independent and underrepresented voices. The content is previewed ahead of selection to ensure quality, but there are no specific requirements about the podcast size and reach.</p>
<p>In general, the new Spotlight creators will debut toward the front of the week, but the specific days are fluid to adapt to holidays, major cultural events and others. The next Spotlight selection, for example, will launch in mid-February.</p>
<p>The Spotlight creators will be featured at the top of the Browse tab of Apple Podcasts and will be promoted through the Apple Podcasts social media accounts. Some form of in-app featuring will continue throughout the entire month the creators are in the &#8220;spotlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple says it will also collaborate with the featured creators on their own channels. Over time, you&#8217;ll see promotion via additional Apple-operated channels including outdoor advertising in major U.S. metros.</p>
<p>The news of the new editorial program comes shortly after <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify">a report from The Information</a> suggested Apple is working to expand its podcasts platform with the introduction of a podcast subscription service, threatening rivals like Spotify, SiriusXM and Amazon.</p>
<p>Though Apple Podcasts still leads the market, <a href="https://podnews.net/article/spotify-bigger-than-apple">Spotify has been catching up</a> by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/spotify-agrees-to-buy-podcast-ad-tech-company-for-235-million">spending</a> over $800 million on podcast companies, like Anchor, the Ringer, Gimlet Media, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">more recently,</a> podcast ad company Megaphone.</p>
<p>SiriusXM, meanwhile, bought podcast management and analytics platform Simplecast, ad tech platform AdsWizz, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">and podcast app Stitcher</a>. Not to be left out, Amazon just a few weeks ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-podcast-network-wondery/">announced it was acquiring</a> the podcast network Wondery.</p>
<p>Beyond helping the creators grow their audience, Apple says the larger goal with the program is to welcome new audiences to podcasts, in general.</p>
<p>Though podcasts are growing in popularity, the <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2020/">monthly podcast listener base is just 37%</a> in the U.S., according to Edison Research. That means it&#8217;s nowhere near being an activity that&#8217;s popular among a majority of the U.S. population at this time. Before Apple can effectively monetize podcasts as a subscription service, it needs to help get more people listening to podcasts on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Apple declined to say if the program would expand outside the U.S. at a later date.</p>
