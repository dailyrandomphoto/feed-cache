					<description><![CDATA[Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">wrote about the early-stage venture capital market</a>, with the goal of understanding how some startups are raising more seed capital before they work on their Series A, while other startups are seemingly raising their first lettered round while in the nascent stages of scaling.</p>
<p>The expedition was rooted in commentary from <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Rudina Seseri of Glasswing Ventures</a>, who said abundant seed capital in the United States allows founders to get a lot done before they raise a Series A, effectively delaying these rounds. But after those founders did raise that A, their Series B round could rapidly follow thanks to later-stage money showing up in earlier-stage deals in hopes of snagging ownership in hot companies.</p>
<p>The idea? Slow As, fast Bs.</p>
<p>After chatting with Seseri more and a number of other venture capitalists about the concept, a second dynamic emerged. Namely that the “typical” early-stage funding round, as Seseri described it, was “becoming atypical because of the rise of preemptive rounds [in which] typical expectations on metrics go out the window.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Series As, she said, could come mere months after a seed deal, and Series B rounds were seeing expected revenue thresholds tumble in part to “large, multiasset players that have come down market and are offering a different product than typical VCs &#8212; very fast term sheets, no active involvement post-investment, large investments amounts and high valuations.”</p>
<p>Focusing on just the Series A dynamic, the old rule of thumb that a startup would need to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) is now often moot. Some startups are delaying their A rounds until they reach $2 million in ARR thanks to ample seed capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While some startups delay their A rounds, others raise the critical investment earlier and earlier, perhaps with even a few hundred thousand in ARR.</p>
<p>What’s different between the two groups? Startups with &#8220;elite status&#8221; are able to jump ahead to their Series A, while other founders spend more time cobbling together adequate seed capital to get to sufficient scale to attract an A.</p>
<p>The dynamic is not merely a United States phenomenon. The two-tier venture capital market is also showing up in Latin America, a globally important and rapidly expanding startup region. (Brazilian fintech startup Nubank, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">just closed a $750 million round</a>.)</p>
<p>This morning, we’re diving into the Latin American venture capital market and its early-stage dynamics. We also have notes on the European scene, so expect more on the topic next week. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s hot</h2>
<p>Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.</p>
<p>The announcements themselves often emphasize round size: For instance, the recent $100 million Series B round into Colombian proptech startup Habi was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005589/en/Habi-Raises-100-Million-Series-B-Led-by-SoftBank-and-Expands-Footprint-into-Mexico">touted</a> as &#8220;the largest Series B for a startup headquartered in Colombia.&#8221; This follows other 2021 records such as &#8220;the largest Series A for Mexico &#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">$65 million for online grocer Jüsto</a> &#8212; and &#8220;the largest Series A ever raised by a Latin American fintech&#8221; &#8212;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/">$43 million</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">&#8220;Plaid for Latin America&#8221;</a> Belvo.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mercuryo.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has built a cross-border payments network, has raised $7.5 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company describes itself as “a crypto infrastructure company” that aims to make blockchain useful for businesses via its “digital asset payment gateway.” Specifically, it aggregates various payment solutions and provides fiat and crypto payments and payouts for businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo aims to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies as a tool for putting in motion next-gen cross-border transfers or as it puts it, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“to allow any business to become a fintech company without the need to keep up with its complications.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The need for fast and efficient international payments, especially for businesses, is as relevant as ever,” said Petr Kozyakov, Mercuryo’s co-founder and CEO. While there is no shortage of companies enabling cross-border payments, the startup’s emphasis on crypto is a differentiator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our team has a clear plan on making crypto universally available by enabling cheap and straightforward transactions,” Kozyakov said. “Cryptocurrency assets can then be used to process global money transfers, mass payouts and facilitate acquiring services, among other things.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo began onboarding customers at the beginning of 2019, and has seen impressive growth since with annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April surpassing over $50 million. Its customer base is approaching 1 million, and the company has partnerships with a number of large crypto players including Binance, Bitfinex, Trezor, Trust Wallet, Bithumb and Bybit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the company said its turnover spiked by 50 times while run-rate turnover crossed $2.5 billion in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build on that momentum, Mercuryo has begun expanding to new markets, including the United States, where it launched its crypto payments offering for B2B customers in all states earlier this year. It also plans to “gradually” expand to Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target Global led Mercuryo’s Series A, which also included </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participation from a group of angel investors and brings the startup&#8217;s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $10 million.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170352" style="width: 658px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170352" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170352 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Alexander-Vasiliev-Greg-Waisman-Petr-Kozyakov--e1624639508126.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="648" height="432" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Alexander Vasiliev, Greg Waisman, Petr Kozyakov / MercuryO</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to launch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency debit card (spending globally directly from the crypto balance in the wallet) and continuing to expand to new markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo’s various products include a multicurrency wallet with a built-in crypto exchange and digital asset purchasing functionality, a widget and high-volume cryptocurrency acquiring and OTC services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kozyakov says the company doesn’t charge for currency conversion and has no other “hidden fees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We enable instant and easy cross-border transactions for our partners and their customers,” he said. “Also, the money transfer services lack intermediaries and require no additional steps to finalize transactions. Instead, the process narrows down to only two operations: a fiat-to-crypto exchange when sending a transfer and a crypto-to-fiat conversion when receiving funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo also offers crypto SaaS products, giving customers a way to buy crypto via their fiat accounts while delegating digital asset management to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it be virtual accounts or third-party customer wallets, the company handles most cryptocurrency-related processes for banks, so they can focus more on their core operations,” Kozyakov said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lobanov, Target Global’s co-founder, said that as an experiment, his firm tested numerous solutions to buy Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doing our diligence, we measured ‘time to crypto’ – how long it takes from going to the App Store and downloading the app until the digital assets arrive in the wallet,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo came first with 6 minutes, including everything from KYC and funding to getting the cryptocurrency, according to Lobanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The second-best result was 20 minutes, while some apps took forever to process our transaction,” he added. “This company is a game-changer in the field, and we are delighted to have been their supporters since the early days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to release a product that will give businesses a way to send instant mass payments to multiple customers and gig workers simultaneously, no matter where the receiver is located.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Several personalized health tech startups hope to reinvent care for patients suffering from musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic unevenly roars on, <a href="https://twitter.com/emelton?lang=en">Emily Melton</a>, founder and managing partner of <a href="https://threshold.vc/">Threshold VC</a>, is reflecting on a previous public health crisis: the Spanish Flu.</p>
<p>She says the response just over a century ago prompted the rise of interventional medicine — treating illness through surgery or medicine only after symptoms manifest. Today, interventional medicine is the dominant mindset in Western healthcare. And, Melton, a lead investor in health tech startups including Livongo, Tia, and Calibrate, says the care pathway ages well.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s happening in our society? Chronic diseases, chronic pain, diabetes, and obesity,” she said. “That doesn’t require a magic pill and there&#8217;s not just a surgery. Oftentimes, there’s therapeutic components, behavior changes, and movable touchpoints.”</p>
<p>Enter personalized medicine. The buzzy yet powerful framing is growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups. It’s a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or co-morbidities. In hormonal health, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">personalized medicine could add more data and specificity </a>to which birth control someone takes, instead of the usual process of trial and error. Essentially, it’s the opposite of interventional medicine.</p>
<p>“We’re not just an arm or a leg, we’re not just obese or a diabetic or a pain sufferer,” Melton said. “How do we treat you as a whole person?”</p>
<p>A number of companies are using this approach to reinvent care for patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain. These conditions are commonly treated with addictive opioids, a major public health concern. As an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, entrepreneurs are working on solutions that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo. And the money market is certainly there: in 2017, the global MSK medical market <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/3973843/musculoskeletal-diseases-market-forecast-2020#:~:text=The%20global%20musculoskeletal%20diseases%20Market,5.5%25%20during%202018%20to%202023.">was valued at $57.4 billion</a>; the market for chronic pain, which overlaps with MSK medicine, is expected to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chronic-pain-treatment-market-to-cross-151-7-billion-value-by-2030-ps-intelligence-301136366.html">hit $151.7 billion in value by 2030.</a></p>
<p>“Oftentimes it&#8217;s not new ideas, it&#8217;s conflating a number of factors that come together at one moment in time that allow exponential change,” that makes a startup work,” Melton said, of the boom and recent activity in MSK medicine. Today, we’ll focus on three startups taking different approaches to help people suffering from chronic pain and MSK-related conditions: Clearing, Peerwell, and Hinge Health.</p>
<h2><strong>Clearing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-dorfman-3a89803/">Avi Dorfman</a> says going direct to consumers is the most effective way to treat chronic pain, so he founded<a href="https://www.clearing.com/"> Clearing</a>. The digital health startup worked with a medical advisory board of physicians and researchers from Harvard, John Hopkins, and NYC&#8217;s Hospital for Special Surgery to create an opioid-free solution for people struggling with pain.</p>
<p>Last month, Clearing raised a $20 million seed round led by Bessemer and Founders Fund. Melton also invested in the round on behalf of Threshold.</p>
<p>Clearing offers four products: prescription compound cream that includes FDA-approved ingredients, CBD cream for topical discomfort, nutraceuticals to supplement joint health, and a directory of pre-recorded, at-home exercises. It currently is available to patients in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU for all its lethargy, faults and fetishization of bureaucracy, is, ultimately, a good idea. It might be 64 years from the formation of the European Common Market, but it is 29 years since the EU&#8217;s formation in the Maastricht Treaty, and this international entity is definitely still acting like an indecisive millennial, happy to flit around tech startup policy. It’s long due time for this digital nomad to commit to one ‘location’ on how it treats startups.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing we can all agree on, this is a unique moment in time. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of technology globally, especially in Europe. Thankfully, tech companies and startups have proven to be more resilient than much of the established economy. As a result, the EU’s political leaders have started to look towards the innovation economy for a more sustainable future in Europe.</p>
<p>But this moment has not come soon enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The European tech scene is still lagging behind its US and Asia counterparts in numbers of startups created, talent in the tech sector, financing rounds, and IPOs / exits. It doesn’t help, of course, that the European market is so fractionalized, and will be for a long time to come.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely no excuse when it comes to the EU’s obligations to reform startup legislation, taxation, and the development of talent, to “level the playing field” against the US and Asian tech giants.</p>
<p>But, to put it bluntly: The EU can’t seem to get its shit together around startups.</p>
<p>Consider this litany of proposals.</p>
<p>Starting as far back a 2016 we had the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2016%3A733%3AFIN">Start-Up and Scale-Up Initiative</a>. We even had the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/european-scaleup-manifesto/">Scale-Up Manifesto</a> in the same year. Then there was the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/startup-communities-look-ahead-11-concrete-policy-recommendations-european-leaders">Cluj Recommendations</a> (2019), and the <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">Not Optional</a> campaign for options reform in 2020.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, the community of VC´s, founders, and startup associations in Europe has been saying mostly the same things for <em>years</em>, to national and European leaders.</p>
<p>Finally, this year, we got something approaching a summation of all these efforts.</p>
<p>Portugal, which has the European presidency for the first half of this year, took the bull by its horns and created something approaching a final draft of what the EU needs.</p>
<p>After, <em>again</em>, intense consultations with European ecosystem stakeholders, it identified eight best practices in order to level the playing field covering the gamut of issues such as fast startup creation, talent, stock options, innovation in regulation and access to finance. You name it, it covered it.</p>
<p>These were then put into the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/startup-europe">Startup Nations Standard</a> and presented to the European Council at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziTo5UOYnk8">Digital Day</a> on March 19th, together with the European Commission&#8217;s DG CNECT and its Commissioner Tierry Breton. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/on-friday-the-eu-will-put-startup-friendly-legislation-to-member-states-will-they-sign-up/">wrote about</a> this at the time.</p>
<p>Would the EU finally get a grip, and sign up for these evidently workable proposals?</p>
<p>It seemed, at least, that we might be getting somewhere. Some 25 member states signed the declaration that day, and perhaps for the first time, the political consensus seemed to be forming around this policy.</p>
<p>Indeed, a body set up to shepherd the initiative (the European Startup Nations Alliance) was even announced by Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa which, he said, would be tasked with monitoring, developing and optimizing the standards, collecting data from the member states on their success and failure, and reporting on its findings in a bi-annual conference aligned with the changing presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p>It would seem we could pop open a chilled bottle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bairrada_DOC">DOC Bairrada Espumante</a> and celebrate that Europe might finally start implementing at least the basics from these suggested policies.</p>
<p>But no. With the pandemic still raging, it seemed the EU&#8217;s leaders still had plenty of time on their hands to ponder these subjects.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech/">Scaleup Europe</a> initiative emerged from the mind of Emmanuel Macron, assembling a select group of 150-plus of Europe’s leading tech founders, investors, researchers, corporate CEOs and government officials to do some more pondering about startups. And then there was the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Press-Release-10-May-2021-Action-Plan-to-Make-Europe-the-new-Global-Powerhouse-for-Startups.pdf">Global Powerhouse Initiative</a> of DG Research &amp; Innovations Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel.</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we were about to go through this process all over again, with the EU acting as if it had the memory span of a giant goldfish.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not arguing that all these collective actions are a bad thing. But, by golly, European startups need more decisive action than this.</p>
<p>As things stand, instead of implementing the very reasonable Portuguese proposals, we will now have to wait for the EU&#8217;s wheels to slowly turn until the French presidency comes around next year.</p>
<p>That said, with any luck, a body to oversee the implementation of tech startup policy that is mandated by the European community, composed of organizations like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/">La French Tech</a>, <a href="https://startupportugal.com/">Startup Portugal</a> and <a href="https://startupestonia.ee/en">Startup Estonia</a>, might finally seem within reach.</p>
<p>But to anyone from the outside, it feels again as if the gnashing of EU policy teeth will have to go on yet longer. With the French calling for a &#8216;La French Tech for Europe&#8217; and the Portuguese having already launched ESNA, the efforts seem far from coordinated.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, tech startup founders and investors could not care less where this new body comes from or which country launches it.</p>
<p>After years of contributions, years of consultations, the time for action is now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for EU member states to agree, and move forward, helping other member states catch up based on established best practices.</p>
<p>It’s time for the long-awaited European Tech Giants to blossom, take on the US-born Big Tech Giants, and for Europe to finally punch its weight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_3221">statement today</a>, the European Commission announced that the professional social network has joined the EU&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online, with justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, welcoming LinkedIn&#8217;s (albeit tardy) participation, and adding in a statement that the code &#8220;is and will remain an important tool in the fight against hate speech, including within the framework established by digital services legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I invite more businesses to join, so that the online world is free from hate,&#8221; Reynders added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While LinkedIn&#8217;s name wasn&#8217;t formally associated with the voluntary Code before now it said it has &#8220;supported&#8221; the effort via parent company Microsoft, which was already signed up.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/june/24/keeping-conversations-safe--trusted-and-professional">statement</a> on its decision to formally join now, it also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;LinkedIn is a place for professional conversations where people come to connect, learn and find new opportunities. Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn’t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members’ professional identities for the entirety of their career &#8212; it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the EU &#8216;illegal hate speech&#8217; can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.</p>
<p>A number of Member States have national laws on the issue &#8212; and some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/germany-tightens-online-hate-speech-rules-to-make-platforms-send-reports-straight-to-the-feds/">passed their own legislation</a> specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.</p>
<p>The initiative kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/facebook-twitter-youtube-and-microsoft-agree-to-remove-hate-speech-across-the-eu/">back in 2016</a> &#8212; when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).</p>
<p>Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined &#8212; with video sharing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/tiktok-joins-europes-code-on-tackling-hate-speech/">TikTok signing up last October</a>, for example.</p>
<p>But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren&#8217;t participating. Hence the Commission&#8217;s call for more digital services companies to get on board.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.</p>
<p>L<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a>) to existing ecommerce rules </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements &#8212; in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles &#8212; at least at a high level &#8212; the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code. </span></p>
<p>The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">this April</a>) &#8212; which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation &#8212; as Reynders&#8217; remarks underline.</p>
<p>Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of &#8216;carrots and sticks&#8217; where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial &#8216;danger zone&#8217; of speech regulation.</p>
<p>So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized &#8216;notice and response&#8217; procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there&#8217;s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).</p>

<p>The EU has &#8212; for several years &#8212; had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation</a> too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)</p>
<p>And while lawmakers recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">announced a plan to beef that Code up</a> &#8212; to make it &#8220;more binding&#8221;, as they oxymoronically put it &#8212; it certainly isn&#8217;t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.</p>
<p>In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.</p>
<p>It added that it welcomed the results &#8212; but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.</p>
<p>The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of &#8216;fake news&#8217; being fenced on their platforms, including &#8212; on the public health front &#8212; what they last year dubbed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">coronavirus infodemic</a>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers&#8217; minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericachidi/">Erica Chidi</a>, the co-founder of<a href="https://loomhq.com/"> Loom</a> and a first-generation Nigerian-American, learned how to wrap the language of self-care around her body from an early age. She spent the early part of her life in South Africa, then the epicenter of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, watching her father work as an endocrinologist and infectious disease specialist. That exposure was supplemented by Chidi’s mother, a registered nurse, who made “talking about the body something that was pretty commonplace in our house.” Her childhood seeded an understanding of the women’s body, a conversation that can be stigmatized in many immigrant households.</p>
<p>Eventually, Chidi became a Doula, a trained person who guides mothers through the process toward motherhood.</p>
<p>“As a doula, I really focused on individual care and helping people be able to advocate for themselves&#8230;in order for them to optimize their healthcare experience wherever they were within their sexual reproductive health journey,” she said. “When I flash forward to what I’ve been doing now, 10 years later, I know back then what I was really focusing on was user experience.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the seedling that led to Loom, a digital learning platform about women’s health, with an explicit focus on the sexual and reproductive health journey. Chidi founded it in 2017 alongside Quinn Lundberg, a women’s healthcare policy advocate. After the duo <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90533945/this-doula-raised-3-million-to-build-a-digital-platform-for-reproductive-education">raised $3 million</a> in seed financing last year, Loom is now officially launching its first course to the public: a Pregnancy and Postpartum program.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="E2vBFUd729"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/embed/#?secret=E2vBFUd729" data-secret="E2vBFUd729" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The program, which costs $90 for 12 months of access, includes asynchronous and synchronous learning components.</p>
<p>The video repository, which Chidi describes as a “Masterclass, but for sexual reproductive health,” includes videos about medicated, unmedicated, and cesarean birth, as well as advice on choosing a care provider. The live components include weekly small pods, led mostly by clinicians, going into specific issues and concerns that mothers might be facing, such as postpartum care or trimester tips. There’s also a monthly talk hosted by Chidi, in which the entire community is invited to dive into a singular topic within the pregnancy and postpartum world. For now, these sessions are held over Zoom, but Loom is in the process of developing its own video platform.</p>
<p>Chidi said that the company is more interested in giving users instantaneous and actionable value from content, instead of getting them to view or complete all of the content. However, that&#8217;s easier said than done. The company needs to balance engaging material with nuanced, clinician-approved medical advice. Right now, Chidi teaches much of the content, and despite her upbringing and experience, Doulas are not considered medical professionals. Loom is working with research institutions, community organizations and the Reproductive Justice Framework &#8211; an anti-racist movement about reproductive rights and social justice &#8211; to develop its content.</p>
<p>Expectful, a company similar in mission to Loom, raised $3 million this year. Expectful is a meditation and sleep app for women, and is now expanding into a community and marketplace for new and expecting mothers. The startup’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/"> new chief executive Nathalie Walton</a> joins Chidi in being two of the few dozen Black female founders to raise millions in venture capital.</p>

<p>Chidi, a Black LGBTQ+ founder, used to think that she was an “untraditional founder” in a lot of ways: “I didn&#8217;t go to Stanford, I don&#8217;t have an MBA, and I don&#8217;t have a technical background,” she said. “But what I&#8217;ve realized over the past year is that I&#8217;ve always been a deep systems thinker. I&#8217;m a rigorous writer, and a very kind of tactical educator, and all of those skills really transferred well into the product building process.” That “deeply emotion-centered, deeply-humanistic framework” that she brings is a strategic fit in the world of women’s healthcare.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What do all companies, regardless of industry, say they want? Growth. Lighting-fast, continuous growth. The good news is you can quickly learn which growth marketing strategies work by studying other companies&#8217; success and adapting it to your own business.</p>
<p>Most technophiles remember Dropbox’s referral program — the one that helped it grow <a href="https://viral-loops.com/blog/dropbox-grew-3900-simple-referral-program/">3,900%</a> in 15 months. Its philosophy was simple: reward customers with free storage space for referring other customers. In 2008, it was an absolute revelation. A golden ticket.</p>

<p>In 2021, you’d be hard-pressed to find a company without a formal <a href="https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/referral-program-software/">referral program</a>. It’s a standard growth marketing trick. If you study other companies’ tactics, you’re going to be able to shortcut growth — it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. When you consider the speed with which venture capital funds need to return dollars to their investors and that consumer acquisition costs have increased by <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/customer-research-steve-blank-des-traynor">55%</a> over the last three years, forward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth.</p>
<p>Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it’s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch. Here are five companies with growth strategies worth emulating — including the most important lessons you can begin applying to your business today.</p>

<h2>1. Doing SEO right: Flo</h2>
<p>SEO is going to spend this summer shaking in its boots. Google <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-page-experience-update-rolls-out-just-as-core-update-finishes-wednesdays-daily-brief-349658">began rolling out</a> a two-week core algorithm update on June 2, and it’s unleashing a page experience update through August. These updates usually come with significant volatility that makes organic Google rankings jump all over the place.</p>
<p>However, one clear winner of the 2021 SEO footrace is <a href="https://flo.health/">Flo</a>, a women’s ovulation calendar, period tracker and pregnancy app. According to <a href="https://growthbarseo.com/">GrowthBar</a>, a SEO tool I co-founded, Flo’s organic traffic has soared 192% over the past two months and it ranks on page one for some staggeringly competitive women’s health keywords.</p>
<p>If SEO is a strategy you’re pursuing, there are two key growth lessons to take away from Flo’s recent success.</p>
<p><strong>1. Authority matters now more than ever</strong>. Healthcare websites fall into a category of sensitive sites that Google classifies as Your Money, Your Life (YMYL). Because of oodles of fake news and suspect web content, Google has rightfully raised its bar for expertise and factuality. Go to any one of Flo’s more than 1,000 blog posts (yes, content is still king) and you’ll see that nearly all of them are reviewed by gynecologists, primary care physicians or some other type of women’s health expert. Its site also has pages devoted to its writers and medical reviewers, content guidelines and peer-review specifications. Flo takes its information seriously. From the 2020 election to QAnon to vaccination side effects, Google is on high alert. Whatever your niche, you need to establish credibility to win Google searches.</p>

And who can blame you? We sure don’t.</p>
<p>On July 8-9, this two-day virtual bootcamp will deliver leading startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">gurus, mavens and masters</a> serving up choice, actionable advice on essential topics designed to help you build a stronger startup.</p>
<p><strong>Action Item:</strong> If you haven’t registered yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">buy your pass right here</a> and get on board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Your pass includes a free, three-month subscription to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>, our members-only program featuring exclusive daily articles for founders and startup teams.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick run through what you’ll experience in July at TC Early Stage 2021.</p>
<p>Day one is all about highly interactive sessions on topics such as marketplace positioning, growth marketing, content development and — everyone’s favorite subject — fundraising.</p>
<p>Here are just two prime examples of the topics and talent on tap.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Marketing 101:</strong> “Growth” is a concept that is inconsistently defined and operationalized across startups. Greylock Partner, Mike Duboe has built growth teams at early-stage and growth/IPO-stage companies and will talk about how companies should think about organization design for growth, best practices in scaling performance marketing practices, and how investors deconstruct healthy vs unhealthy growth.</p>
<p><strong>How Founders Can Think Like a VC:</strong> Though there is more capital flowing through the market than ever before, the world of fundraising can still feel like a black box to many founders. Hear Norwest Venture Partners’ Lisa Wu explain how founders can get in the mind of a VC, framing their company’s narrative in terms that VCs love. Be the ball, as they say.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the boffo breakout sessions from Dell Technologies, UserTesting, Movile, Pilot and oVice. You’ll find topic descriptions and times (specific to your location) in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Day two is all about the pitch-off. Tune in as 10 early-stage startups take the virtual stage and deliver their best five-minute pitch to a global audience of investors, TC editors, press and event attendees. A five-minute Q&amp;A with the judges follows that pitch.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/announcing-the-early-stage-pitch-off-judges-2/">crackerjack judges</a> — Ben Sun, Primary Venture Partners; Leah Solivan, Fuel Capital and Shardul Shah, Index Ventures — will provide invaluable feedback. Who knows? You might hear tips that help turn your pitch deck into a fundraising machine.</p>
<p>Only two more weeks until <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seattle-based <a href="https://edgedelta.com/">Edge Delta</a>, a startup that is building a modern distributed monitoring stack that is competing directly with industry heavyweights like Splunk, New Relic and Datadog, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Menlo Ventures and Tim Tully, the former CTO of Splunk. Previous investors MaC Venture Capital and Amity Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to $18 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our thesis is that there&#8217;s no way that enterprises today can continue to analyze all their data in real time,&#8221; said Edge Delta co-founder and CEO Ozan Unlu, who has worked in the observability space for about 15 years already (including at Microsoft and Sumo Logic). &#8220;The way that it was traditionally done with these primitive, centralized models &#8212; there&#8217;s just too much data. It worked 10 years ago, but gigabytes turned into terabytes and now terabytes are turning into petabytes. That whole model is breaking down.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170060" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170060" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170060" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png 2476w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=1536,1006 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=2048,1341 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170060" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edge Delta</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He acknowledges that traditional big data warehousing works quite well for business intelligence and analytics use cases. But that&#8217;s not real-time and also involves moving a lot of data from where it&#8217;s generated to a centralized warehouse. The promise of Edge Delta is that it can offer all of the capabilities of this centralized model by allowing enterprises to start to analyze their logs, metrics, traces and other telemetry right at the source. This, in turn, also allows them to get visibility into all of the data that&#8217;s generated there, instead of many of today&#8217;s systems, which only provide insights into a small slice of this information.</p>
<p>While competing services tend to have agents that run on a customer&#8217;s machine, but typically only compress the data, encrypt it and then send it on to its final destination, Edge Delta&#8217;s agent starts analyzing the data right at the local level. With that, if you want to, for example, graph error rates from your Kubernetes cluster, you wouldn&#8217;t have to gather all of this data and send it off to your data warehouse where it has to be indexed before it can be analyzed and graphed.</p>
<p>With Edge Delta, you could instead have every single node draw its own graph, which Edge Delta can then combine later on. With this, Edge Delta argues, its agent is able to offer significant performance benefits, often by orders of magnitude. This also allows businesses to run their machine learning models at the edge, as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I saw before I was leaving Splunk was that people were sort of being choosy about where they put workloads for a variety of reasons, including cost control,&#8221; said Menlo Ventures&#8217; Tim Tully, who joined the firm only a couple of months ago. &#8220;So this idea that you can move some of the compute down to the edge and lower latency and do machine learning at the edge in a distributed way was incredibly fascinating to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edge Delta is able to offer a significantly cheaper service, in large part because it doesn&#8217;t have to run a lot of compute and manage huge storage pools itself since a lot of that is handled at the edge. And while the customers obviously still incur some overhead to provision this compute power, it&#8217;s still significantly less than what they would be paying for a comparable service. The company argues that it typically sees about a 90 percent improvement in total cost of ownership compared to traditional centralized services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170059" style="width: 5290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170059" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170059 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png" alt="" width="5280" height="2782" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png 5280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=2048,1079 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EdgeDelta_img3.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5280px) 100vw, 5280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170059" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edge Delta</p></div></p>
<p>Edge Delta charges <a href="https://edgedelta.com/pricing/">based on volume</a> and it is not shy to compare its prices with Splunk&#8217;s and does so right on its <a href="https://edgedelta.com/pricing/">pricing calculator</a>. Indeed, in talking to Tully and Unlu, Splunk was clearly on everybody&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s kind of this concept of unbundling of Splunk,&#8221; Unlu said. &#8220;You have Snowflake and the data warehouse solutions coming in from one side, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8216;hey, if you don&#8217;t care about real time, go use us.&#8217; And then we&#8217;re the other half of the equation, which is: actually there&#8217;s a lot of real-time operational use cases and this model is actually better for those massive stream processing datasets that you required to analyze in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite this competition, Edge Delta can still integrate with Splunk and similar services. Users can still take their data, ingest it through Edge Delta and then pass it on to the likes of Sumo Logic, Splunk, AWS&#8217;s S3 and other solutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you follow the trajectory of Splunk, we had this whole idea of building this business around IoT and Splunk at the Edge &#8212; and we never really quite got there,&#8221; Tully said. &#8220;I think what we&#8217;re winding up seeing collectively is the edge actually means something a little bit different. [&#8230;] The advances in distributed computing and sophistication of hardware at the edge allows these types of problems to be solved at a lower cost and lower latency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Edge Delta team plans to use the new funding to expand its team and support all of the new customers that have shown interest in the product. For that, it is building out its go-to-market and marketing teams, as well as its customer success and support teams.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week we did something fun and different and good: a live show! A good number of people came, and asked questions, and altogether, it was a blast.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> had a lovely time with the regular work, while Grace and Chris and Kevin made the whole operation function. We&#8217;ll likely post a bonus episode of the Q&amp;A on Saturday if people are interested in Equity After Hours.</p>
<p>That aside, what did we talk about in a longer-than-usual episode? Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/"><strong>Buzzfeed is going public!</strong> </a>Alex wrote about the news here, but the gist is that the media company is merging with a SPAC, buying Complex, and raising some capital at the same time. We have thoughts about it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/"><strong>Maybe neobanks will break even?</strong> </a>We dug into some fintech news through the perspective of some recent news from the neobank market.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/">MAJORITY raised MONEY</a></strong> for migrants to the United States, while MFast, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/vietnamese-financial-services-app-mfast-gets-1-5m-pre-series-a-led-by-do-ventures/">a Vietnamese financial services app</a></strong>, got some funding of its own amid the neobank boom.</li>
<li>Alex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">interviewed a leading venture capitalist</a>. So, we talked about that.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/"><strong>What&#8217;s going on with the early-stage venture capital market?</strong></a> That&#8217;s something we tried to parse. The gist is that the rapidly-evolving world of investing in startups is in the midst of a few trends that are worth understanding. Even if they are slightly contradictory.</li>
<li>A16z<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/"> tripled down on crypto with a new $2.2 billion fund, </a>giving it a total of $18.8 billion in assets under management.</li>
<li>Edtech leaders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/edtech-culture-memo/">rallied around a memo of their own this past week.</a></li>
<li>And then to close, we raced through some of our recent reporting on a new fund that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/academy-investor-network-usaa/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAInF86XeyKZb94yYgs3GDdMw_jHxx56nRffvzpoaKhVFAan7RHDy2BVX8mPoLOglE98tzPsxkPorvv5lT1Cn2KIEUL5fbdHZUarhklC7CuV5wKU_SplTmOR25MdZfj2kcdxOZoc1QRev9lgsyxt7SSLz_umfegu1XUsWdBFKI1Zt">will invest in American military institute graduates</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/software-design-startup-figma-is-now-worth-10-billion?sref=gni836kR">Figma&#8217;s huge new round of capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/waitwhat-raises-12m-to-double-down-on-what-comes-after-podcasts/">and WaitWhat</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s always fun to play around with our show, and thank you to everyone who came out and supported us in our first-ever, but probably not last-ever, virtual live show. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are back to regular, however, starting Monday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s cloud services giant Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a>) is getting into the encrypted messaging business. The company has just <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has acquired secure communications service <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wickr">Wickr</a> &#8212; a messaging app that has geared itself towards <a href="https://wickr.com/customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providing services</a> to government and military groups and enterprises. It claims to be the only &#8220;collaboration service&#8221; that meets security criteria set out by the NSA.</p>
<p>AWS will continue operating Wickr as is, and offer its services to AWS customers, &#8220;effective immediately,&#8221; notes a blog post from Stephen Schmidt, the VP and CISO for AWS, announcing the news.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed in the short announcement. Wickr had raised just under $60 million in funding, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/60487-57/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data (it also notes a valuation of under $30 million but that seems to be a very old estimate). Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s cloud and enterprise division, AWS, has been a juggernaut for the e-commerce and services giant. AWS posted revenues of <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13.5 billion last quarter</a>, up 32% year-on-year, with net income of $8.1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s purchase of a messaging product geared at providing secure services to government bodies is coming at a time when the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-05/microsoft-s-10-billion-pentagon-deal-at-risk-amid-amazon-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be embroiled in a dispute around the JEDI contract</a>, a $10 billion deal to provide services to the U.S. that Microsoft was granted during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if this is part of Amazon&#8217;s effort to build out more infrastructure and services to flesh out its own offerings, or simply a sign that it will continue to court that market, with or without JEDI in its pocket.</p>
<p>The move also suggests that Amazon could be planning to make a bigger push into the messaging space &#8212; some might say a long-awaited move from the company.</p>
<p>The AWS division currently offers communications service <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/amazon-chime/">Chime, </a>which enables organizations to meet, chat, and place business calls. But it&#8217;s a little-known product that&#8217;s failed to have the impact of rival services Slack or Microsoft Teams, and it doesn&#8217;t focus on end-to-end encryption as Wickr does.</p>
<p>Amazon was reportedly working on a messaging product as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/14/amazon-messaging-app-anytime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far back as 2017</a>, although that appeared to be geared more to consumers. The company also owns a number of social media patents.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021, and there are a million other considerations around messaging that wouldn&#8217;t have been key factors in 2017, such as encryption and other privacy-saving features. And messaging in general has grown increasingly sophisticated.</p>
<p>There are four areas in particular where Amazon might be interested in playing here: (1) to offer Wickr as a business service, continuing how it is used today; (2) building &#8220;messaging-as-a-service&#8221; for other companies to use in their apps a la other AWS services; (3) build a consumer messaging app on top of the Wickr infrastructure; (4) more services connected to Echo, expanding more features around a bigger social commerce/interactive play. Or, all of the above.</p>
<p>Commenting on the acquisition, Stephen Schmidt, AWS CISO, said: “The need for this type of secure communications is accelerating. With the move to hybrid work environments, due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, enterprises and government agencies have a growing desire to protect their communications across many remote locations. Wickr’s secure communications solutions help enterprises and government organizations adapt to this change in their workforces and is a welcome addition to the growing set of collaboration and productivity services that AWS offers customers and partners.”</p>
<p>In a notice on its website, Wickr said: &#8220;From our founding ten years ago, we have grown to serve organizations across a wide range of industries, all over the world. Together with AWS, we look forward to taking our solutions to the next level for our customers and partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wickr, which was founded in 2011 and is based in San Fransisco, describes itself as the “most secure” video conferencing and collaboration platform. Unlike other collaboration tools, which encrypt messages as they travel from a user&#8217;s device to a company&#8217;s servers but store those communications in an unencrypted state, Wickr uses end-to-end encryption which means that only people on either end of a conversation can decrypt and read messages.</p>
<p>Wickr also offers users an ephemeral messaging feature, which allows users to set self-destruction timers for as short as a few seconds.</p>
<p>The company has recently made a big push into the enterprise as a result of the mass shift to online communications. In February this year Wickr launched &#8216;Global Federation&#8217;, a feature that enables enterprise and government entities to securely communicate using end-to-end encryption with mission-critical partners outside of their network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">API Holdings, which operates the giant healthcare startup PharmEasy, said on Friday it has reached an agreement to acquire a 66.1% stake in Thyrocare, which runs a diagnostic lab chain, for about $613 million in what is the first ever acquisition of a publicly listed firm by an unicorn startup in the world&#8217;s second most populated nation.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory and other applicable customary approvals. Docon Technologies, a 100% subsidiary of API, will be the acquirer and shall make an open offer for an additional 26% stake for over $241 million, the startup said in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex transaction. In a <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/15C27629-196E-4C08-ADDA-A683A6AF71C9-182938.pdf">filing</a> (PDF) to a local exchange, Thyrocare has disclosed that API Holdings intends to raise another financing round, where it may sell about 4.9% stake to Dr. A. Velumani, a promoter of Thyrocare, for about $202 million. This will imply a valuation of over $4 billion for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The six-year-old startup, which has raised about $572 million to date and was valued at $1.5 billion in its most recent financing round in April, counts Prosus Ventures, Temasek, Eight Roads Ventures, TPG, B Capital Group, and Bessemer Venture Partners among its investors.</p>
<p>Siddharth Shah, chief executive of API Holdings, said on Friday that the startup is in talks to raise a $500 million financing round at $4 billion valuation.</p>
<p>PharmEasy, the only healthcare unicorn startup in India, is the nation&#8217;s largest online pharmacy and diagnostics brand. It operates a business-to-business pharma marketplace with over 6,000 consultation clinics with 90,000 partner retailers across the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>Thyrocare is India’s largest diagnostics solution provider by volume (it performs over 110 million tests in a year). The 26-year-old firm also operates a network of over 3,330 collection centres across in 2,000+ towns in India.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will enable PharmEasy to serve a patient across their entire journey in a treatment, said Shah. The startup has no plans to go public immediately, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to be partnering Thyrocare. We will provide world class customer experience in diagnostics, rivalling our pharmacy experience by leveraging technology, and building on top of the massive scale &amp; truly pan-India presence of Thyrocare. It is our aim to deliver all outpatient healthcare products &amp; services to every Indian within 24 hours,” said 32-year-old Shah in a statement.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s announcement marks the latest in a series of huge transactions in the rapidly consolidating healthcare industry in India. Earlier this month, Tata Digital, the subsidiary of Tata Group, said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/tata-digital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-1mg/">acquiring a majority stake in digital health startup 1mg</a>, valuing the startup at over $400 million. Last year, Amazon entered the space, too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/amazon-pharmacy-bangalore-india-launch/">launching an online pharmacy</a> in the country.</p>
<p>“I am excited about this relationship, unique of its kind in Indian healthcare industry. The unique reach and strength of Thyrocare in diagnostics blended with young and dynamic team of PharmEasy will bring in better healthcare solutions for common man nationwide,” said 62-year-old Dr. Velumani, Chairman and MD of Thyrocare, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are the embodiment of frenetic action. The rush to grow, outrun, and disrupt runs in the lifeblood of today&#8217;s entrepreneurs, driving their fervor and enabling them to capture markets from giants of industries too big to maneuver in a quickly changing landscape.</p>
<p>That has been truer for the mobility landscape than most other industries. Companies like electric scooter providers Lime and Bird have raised tons of capital to change how the urban population gets around, but that growth has come at the cost of a bottom line still in the red.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The difference with Veo is that we control our supply chain — we design, manufacture and deploy our own vehicles, and our lead times are extremely tight.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s striking to see electric scooter company Veo take a different approach to the business. Rather than raising venture capital and scaling quickly, the company does business the old-fashioned way: Proving the model works in one market before moving to the next. This slower, more methodical approach has worked in Veo’s favor — it might be the only company in its industry that has been consistently profitable.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s approach reflects its co-founder and CEO Candice Xie&#8217;s belief that transportation is not an industry that allows companies to scale rapidly and turn a big profit within a year, and especially not if it’s going to make sense for a city. Electric scooters aren’t just a business to Xie — they’re a utility, a tool that can be best implemented through patient collaboration between public and private partners. The CEO has taken this ethos and executed Veo’s business model with the expectation that it will make the company the most impactful in the industry.</p>
<p>A former financial planner for automation solutions company, Schneider Electric, in Chicago, Xie launched Vue in 2017, partly inspired by the bike-share boom in Asia. She was decidedly against the poor quality bikes many operators were deploying at the time, and was also frustrated by the lack of affordable, safe and convenient transportation in Chicago. After some market research, Xie and her co-founder, Yanke (Edwin) Tan, a bike engineer, discovered the gap in last-mile transportation in the United States.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><strong>In your <a href="https://veo-mobility.medium.com/sorry-boys-the-first-profitable-micromobility-company-was-veo-not-lime-97b6b279243f">Medium post</a> titled “Sorry, Boys. The First Profitable Micromobility Company Was Veo, Not Lime,” you fired some shots at Lime and the tech bro-ey micromobility industry at large. </strong><strong>That was pretty bold. </strong></p>
<p>Thank you! I think because of the VC money and also the hype in the industry, a lot of people just forget how easy and simple the business should be. That&#8217;s why I put out the post. It was just time to say something in the industry and help people to understand.</p>
<p><strong>What made you write it?</strong></p>
<p>That was actually the time when Lime announced they were the first ones to achieve profitability, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-touts-a-2020-turnaround-and-2021-profitability/">that&#8217;s through EBITDA</a>, and a lot of people were clapping for them. I was compelled to write because many people who follow the industry asked me, &#8220;Hey, it seems their approach is working? Should we follow suit? Why are you taking a different approach?&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt like that statement from Lime was quite misleading for a lot of people, and I don&#8217;t think that was a responsible statement, either. So that made me feel like I should use my insight and just explain things a bit more openly with our information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other financial sectors in Latin America, the retail investing space is getting a facelift by local tech startups that are cashing in on the untapped potential for democratizing asset management in the region. One of those startups is Chilean-based Fintual, which today announced a $15 million round led by Kaszek Ventures, the largest fund in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintual is an automated passive investment platform that allows the average person in Chile or Mexico to invest in mutual funds containing ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), investment vehicles that aren’t as well known, or as readily accessible in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that got to me was that we were allowing people to invest in the long term, we enable them to invest in instruments they didn’t have access to before,” said Pedro Pineda, co-founder and CEO of Fintual.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Fintual in 2018 with his three co-founders, Pineda was an astronomer and an entrepreneur, who built and sold a Groupon copycat company in Chile called &#8220;Queremos Descuentos&#8221; (We Want Discounts) for just over $1 million when he was 28. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the exit, he admits he was a bit lost in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One day I decided that I wanted to do only the things that I wanted to do and with the people I wanted to do it with,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He traveled for a couple of years, and learned to code, among other things, until Omar Larré, Fintual’s current CIO, presented him with the idea for the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larré had been a portfolio manager at Banco Itau, Brazil’s biggest bank by total assets, and he saw the gap in the market: investing was not set up for the average person. The annual fees were too high, the minimum amount required to invest was too high, and there was a penalty when you removed your money. Additionally, the transaction takes a certain amount of financial know-how that most people don’t possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Pineda, disrupting the financial sector also seemed like a lot of fun, he thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I liked the idea of challenging the financial banks, and you can’t do that without technology. We have this super tool that my parents didn’t have, and you can disrupt an entire industry,” Pineda told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional mutual funds in Chile and Mexico charge up to 6.45% and 5% annually, Fintual charges 1% annually of assets managed. Additionally, Fintual doesn’t require a minimum investment nor a minimum amount of time invested, and users can take their money out any time with no penalties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s different than the U.S.; we invest way less than you do; by a factor of 10 maybe,” Pineda said, comparing the investment rate in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the company was accepted into Y Combinator and became the first Chilean startup to go through the prestigious accelerator. It has been growing exponentially ever since and today it serves 57,000 clients in Chile and Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a table that shows their growth including money managed and percent growth each year since launch.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Assets Under Management (USD)*</b></td>
<td><b>Annual Growth</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2018</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">             1.2 M</span></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2019</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">             12.9 M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">1075%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2020</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">              87.6 M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">679%</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2021</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">              480.7 m</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">548%</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     *Each figure corresponds to the end of each month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current raise will be used to grow the company’s operations in Mexico, expand to other countries &#8212; namely Colombia and Peru &#8212; and grow its tech team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Kaszek, other investors to date include YC, ALLVP, and angel investors such as Plaid’s CTO, Jean-Denis Greze, and Cornershop’s founder Oskar Hjertonsson. To date, the company has raised about $15.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintual’s impressive growth speaks for itself, but Kaszek’s co-founder and managing partner, Nicolas Szekasy, said the fund has been following Fintual since its early days, and he was impressed with the niche market the team identified and even more impressed with the user experience the company had developed which has, in turn, fueled its growth.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given Virgin Galactic the <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-receives-approval-from-faa-for-full-commercial-launch-license-following-success-of-may-test-flight/">green light to begin transporting commercial passengers</a> to space aboard its VSS spacecraft. This is an expansion of the company&#8217;s existing license, which had granted it permission to fly professional test pilots and astronauts to space using its spaceplane. The updated license comes on the heels of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s successful test flight on May 22.</p>
<p>This means that the way is cleared for Virgin Galactic to being operating as the first official &#8216;spaceline&#8217; — which is like an airline, but for space. The company aims to provide regular service for space tourists and researchers to suborbital space, with an experience that includes unparalleled views of Earth and a few minutes of weightless during the roughly 2 hour trip.</p>
<p>The FAA&#8217;s approval is a big step, but it&#8217;s not the final one before Virgin Galactic begins its actual regular service flights for paying customers: The company still needs to complete three remaining test flights before that happens. These will be the first flights of the Virgin spacecraft and its carrier plane while carrying a full crew, and at the goal is still to fly the first of those sometime &#8220;this summer,&#8221; according to CEO Michael Colglazier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/">report from earlier this month</a> claims that Virgin Galactic backer Sir Richard Branson could fly on the next test flight, and that it might occur as early as the coming July 4 weekend, which would mean he makes it to space faster than his billionaire rocket riding rival Jeff Bezos, who is set to make a trip on his own Blue Origin New Shepard spaceship on July 20. Virgin Galactic hasn&#8217;t said officially when its next test flight would occur, however, and sources confirm that the Parabolic Arc report is incorrect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency company <a href="https://www.circle.com">Circle</a> has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/bringing-institutional-defi-to-the-world">announced</a> that it plans to launch a new API for companies using <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/circle-account">Circle accounts</a> to manage crypto assets — and in particular USDC stablecoins. The new API will let companies access decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols starting with <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> lending pools.</p>
<p>Circle is better known as one of the founding members of the <a href="https://www.centre.io">Centre consortium</a> with Coinbase. Along with other <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc">crypto partners</a>, they have issued USD Coin (USDC), a popular stablecoin.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a fixed price. One USDC is always worth one USD. Auditing firms regularly check that issuers always keep as many USD in bank accounts as USDC in circulation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea behind USDC is that you can manipulate money more easily. According to USDC backers, moving money from one person to another should be as easy as sending bitcoin from one wallet to another. Circle has its own solution with Circle accounts. Account holders can programmatically send, receive and hold USDC using standard API calls.</p>
<p>In particular, Circle has built ramps to bridge the gap between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. With <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/payments">Payments</a>, you can accept card payments, bank transfers and USDC transactions. Everything arrives in your Circle account as USDC. Similarly with <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/payouts">Payouts</a>, you can send bank transfers from your Circle account.</p>
<p>Now, Circle also wants to help you access more features with your USDC currently in your Circle account. With the upcoming DeFi API, you’ll be able to access DeFi protocols without having to manually send USDC tokens to another wallet. Circle will start with the Compound protocol.</p>
<p>Compound manages crypto-based lending markets. Some users provide crypto assets and contribute to liquidity pools. Others borrow crypto assets — they first need to provide another type of crypto as collateral.</p>
<p>Users who lend money on Compound are rewarded with interest rates. For instance, when you supply USDC using the Compound protocol, you get 1.74% in annual percentage yield (APY). As USDC is a popular collateral for the Compound protocol, it makes sense that Circle is embracing the protocol with its business accounts. It&#8217;s an interesting addition to Circle&#8217;s treasury infrastructure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/ We&#39;ve created a new API service that allows companies to automate fiat flows, USDC account flows and direct integration with and custody of yield and governance tokens.  Our first protocol launch is Compound Protocol.  More to come.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook and eBay pledge to do more to tackle trade in fake reviews after pressure from UK regulator&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator/embed/#?secret=4sEcmqDdme" data-secret="4sEcmqDdme" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now the CMA has Amazon and Google in its sites, both of which control platforms hosting user reviews &#8212; saying it will be gathering evidence to determine whether they may have broken UK law by taking insufficient action to protect shoppers from fake reviews.</p>
<p>Businesses that mislead consumers or don&#8217;t take action to prevent consumers being misled may be in breach of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-protection-from-unfair-trading-regulations-traders">UK laws intended to protect consumers from unfair trading</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA says its investigation into Amazon and Google follows an initial probe, which it started in May 2020, which was focused on assessing several platforms’ internal systems and processes for identifying and dealing with fake reviews.</p>
<p>That work raised specific concerns about whether the two tech giants have been doing enough to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect fake and misleading reviews or suspicious patterns of behaviour. For example, where the same users have reviewed the same range of products or businesses at similar times to each other and there is no connection between those products or businesses – or where the review suggests that the reviewer has received a payment or other incentive to write a positive review.</li>
<li>Investigate and, where necessary, remove promptly fake and misleading reviews from their platforms.</li>
<li>Impose adequate sanctions on reviewers or businesses to deter them and others from posting fake or misleading reviews on their platforms – including those who have published these types of reviews many times.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulator also said it&#8217;s concerned that Amazon’s systems have been &#8220;failing adequately to prevent and deter some sellers from manipulating product listings&#8221; &#8212; such as, for example, by co-opting positive reviews from other products.</p>
<p>And, well, who hasn&#8217;t been browsing product reviews on Amazon, only to be drawn up short by a reviewer earnestly referring to product attributes that clearly bear no relation to the sale item in question?</p>
<p>While the user reviews that pop up on, for example, Google Maps after a search for a local business can also display &#8216;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/ez85ve/why_google_reviews_is_a_complete_rubbish/">unusual patterns</a>&#8216; of 5-starring (or 1-starring) behaviour&#8230;</p>
<p>Commenting on its investigation into concerns that Amazon and Google are not doing enough to combat the problem of fake reviews the CMA&#8217;s CEO Andrea Coscelli had this to say, in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations. Equally, it’s simply not fair if some businesses can fake 5-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.</p>
<p class="last-child">&#8220;We are investigating concerns that Amazon and Google have not been doing enough to prevent or remove fake reviews to protect customers and honest businesses. It’s important that these tech platforms take responsibility and we stand ready to take action if we find that they are not doing enough.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon and Google were contacted for comment.</p>
<p>A Google Spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/support.google.com/contributionpolicy/answer/7422880?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7422769__;!!FMox2LFwyA!-2uTNuqCyaVbOOzL7k599xUZ3vhBX2Ny5GrFs9xLyWfTCOqa-pQrmsE3ZCQBIXhDit4$" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/support.google.com/contributionpolicy/answer/7422880?hl%3Den%26ref_topic%3D7422769__;!!FMox2LFwyA!-2uTNuqCyaVbOOzL7k599xUZ3vhBX2Ny5GrFs9xLyWfTCOqa-pQrmsE3ZCQBIXhDit4$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624697241893000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZwEXp7DkVn_4x8w6K0W-VYT44Ig">strict policies</a> clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take action &#8212; from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts. We look forward to continuing our work with the CMA to share more on how our industry-leading technology and review teams work to help users find relevant and useful information on Google.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help earn the trust of customers, we devote significant resources to preventing fake or incentivized reviews from appearing in our store. We work hard to ensure that reviews accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product.<span class="m_3059772826490668927apple-converted-space">  </span>We will continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business. We are relentless in protecting our store and will take action to stop fake reviews regardless of the size or location of those who attempt this abuse.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience?ots=1&amp;tag=arstech20-20&amp;linkCode=w50">blog post</a> earlier this month, Amazon &#8212; likely aware of the CMA&#8217;s attention on the issue &#8212; discussed the problem of bogus online reviews, claiming it &#8220;relentlessly innovates to allow only genuine product reviews in our store&#8221;; and offering up some illustrative stats (such as that, in 2020 alone, it stopped more than 200M &#8220;suspected fake reviews&#8221; before they were seen by any customers, mostly via the use of &#8220;proactive detection&#8221;).</p>
<p>However the blog post was also heavily on the defensive &#8212; with the ecommerce giant seeking to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">spread the blame for the fake reviews problem &#8212; saying, for example, that there&#8217;s an &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">increasing trend of bad actors attempting to solicit fake reviews outside Amazon, particularly via social media services&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It sought to frame fake reviews as an industry-wide problem, needing a coordinated, industry-wide solution &#8212; while reserving its heaviest fire for (unnamed) &#8220;social media companies&#8221; (<em>cough</em> Facebook <em>cough</em>) &#8212; and suggesting, for example, that they are the weak link in the chain: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span>We need social media companies whose services are being used to facilitate fake reviews to proactively invest in fraud and fake review controls, partner with us to stop these bad actors, and help consumers shop with confidence. It will take constant innovation and partnership across industries and law enforcement to fully protect consumers and our honest selling partners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s blog post also called for coordinated assistance from consumer protection regulators &#8220;around the world&#8221; to support its existing efforts to litigate against &#8220;bad actors&#8221;, aka &#8220;those who have purchased reviews and the service providers who provided them&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company also told us it has won &#8220;dozens&#8221; of injunctions against providers of fake reviews across Europe &#8212; adding that it won’t shy away from taking legal action.<span class="m_3059772826490668927apple-converted-space"> (It noted, for example, a lawsuit it filed on June 9 with the London Commercial Court a</span>gainst the owners of the websites, AMZ Tigers and TesterJob &#8212; seeking a prohibitory injunction and damages.)</p>
<p>In light of the CMA&#8217;s investigation being opened now, Amazon&#8217;s blog post calling for regulatory assistance to support litigation against purveyors of fake reviews looks like a pre-emptive plea to the CMA to swivel its gaze back onto Facebook&#8217;s marketplace &#8212; and check back in on how the trade in fake reviews is looking over there.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma/embed/#?secret=Qk2251BsRc" data-secret="Qk2251BsRc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We reached out to the CMA to ask whether its investigation into Amazon and Google will dig into the role that review trading groups hosted elsewhere, such as on social media platforms, may play in exacerbating the issue.</p>
<p>The regulator declined to comment on this point &#8212; but we understand the action into Amazon and Google is a separate investigation.</p>
<p>In terms of what could happen if, following the investigation, the CMA considers that the firms have broken UK consumer protection law it has a range of enforcement powers &#8212; which could include securing formal commitments from them to change the way they deal with fake reviews or escalating to court action if needed.</p>
<p>However, for now, it has not reached a view on whether Amazon and Google have broken the law.</p>
<p>The CMA has been increasingly active in regulating Big Tech as it dials up attention on digital markets to prepare for planned UK reforms to competition law that look set to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">usher in an ex ante regime</a> for dealing with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">competition-denting platform power</a>.</p>
<p>The watchdog has a number of other open investigations into Big Tech &#8212; including into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">Google&#8217;s planned deprecation of tracking cookies</a>. It also recently initiated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">a market study</a> into Apple and Google&#8217;s dominance of the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given the watchdog&#8217;s focus on major platforms &#8212; as well as its long standing interest in fake reviews &#8212; it&#8217;s interesting to speculate whether iOS maker Apple may not face some UK scrutiny on this issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">Concerns have also been raised</a> over fake ratings and reviews on its App Store.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, for example, iOS app developer, Kosta Eleftheriou, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filed suit against Apple</a> &#8212; alleging it enticed developers to build apps by claiming the App Store is a safe and trustworthy place but that it doesn’t protect legitimate developers against scammers profiting from their hard work.</p>
<p>The CMA already has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">open investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>. So it will be paying close attention to aspects of the store, saying back in March that it would be investigating whether Apple imposes unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers &#8212; which then ultimately result in users having less choice or paying higher prices for apps and add-ons.</p>
<p>For now, though, the watchdog&#8217;s attention toward the fake reviews issue has been publicly focused elsewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Unacademy is in advanced talks to acquire Rheo TV, a less than two-year-old startup founded by two former Unacademy employees, according to three sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The current deal values <a href="https://rheo.com">Rheo TV</a>, a startup that has built a platform to help professional game streamers live stream their gameplays and monetize those feeds, at around $10 million, one of the sources said. TechCrunch couldn&#8217;t independently verify the terms. The deal proposes Rheo TV&#8217;s team of fewer than a dozen people to join Unacademy.</p>
<p>The younger startup counts Lightspeed India Partners, Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, as well as the founding team of Unacademy &#8212; Gaurav Munjal, Hemesh Singh, and Roman Saini &#8212; among its existing investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Munjal and Sequoia Capital India declined to comment. A founder of Rheo TV didn’t immediately respond.</p>
<p>As tens of millions of college students come online and play games, the startup is betting that many of them, provided platforms are able to help them make a living, will consider streaming their gameplays as a viable career option.</p>
<p>Streamers on Rheo TV, which offers several features similar to those of Twitch, are currently rewarded based on their gameplays, followerbase, and past performance in different tournaments.</p>
<p>If the deal materializes, it would be the latest acquisition by Unacademy, the Bangalore-based startup that has amassed over 5 million monthly active users in over 10,000 cities in India.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Facebook, Tiger Global, and SoftBank-backed startup has acquired WiFi Study, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/unacademy-prepladder-india/">PrepLadder</a>, Coursavy, and led a strategic investment in Mastree.</p>
<p>The startup, which also operates creator platform Graphy, this week unveiled a fund worth over $13 million to help applicants kickstart their online school.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s online education market is estimated to grow to $19.7 billion by 2030, up from $1 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stock in many American companies, like Amazon, Alphabet or Tesla, can host hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Fractional trading, or buying part of a single share through a brokerage, makes them more accessible—at least to people within the United States. Investors in other countries, however, often have to pay high fees through interactive brokers. <a href="https://www.heygotrade.com/">Gotrade</a> makes fractional trading of U.S. stocks available to people in 150 countries, and charges a minimum of just one dollar.</p>
<p>The startup announced it has raised $7 million in seed funding led by LocalGlobe, with participation from Social Leverage, Y Combinator, Picus Capital and Raptor Group. The round also included angel investors like Matt Robinson, co-founder of GoCardless; Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, former chief product officer of Skyscanner; Frank Strauss, former head of Deutsche Bank’s global digital business; and Joel Yarbrough, Asia-Pacific head at Rapyd.</p>
<p>GoTrade was founded in 2019 by David Grant, Norman Wanto and Rohit Mulani. Its app launched three months ago and is currently invite-only. Gotrade claims sign-ups have grown 20% week-on-week, and it now has more than 100,000 users spread across the world. About 65% of Gotrade’s users have traded stocks before, while the rest are first-time investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mulani, the company’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch that the idea for Gotrade was planted when he became interested in American stocks, but discovered many barriers to trading.</p>
<p>“When I was 18, I actually looked to get access in Singapore, and banks were charging $30 per trade. Effectively, the market taught me that I could not get into the market. Fast forward ten years, I decided to look into it again, and the banks were still charging $25 a trade,” he said. “On top of that, their user interfaces were something I didn’t want to look at. So we decided to build a brokerage platform where anyone can get access.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Fractional trading actually came a bit later,” he added. “That was the real MVP for us because fractional really makes investing accessible to anyone globally since all you need is one dollar.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/robinhood-fractional-share/">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/sofi-nears-deal-to-go-public-in-merger-with-chamath-palihapitiyas-newest-spac/">SoFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/stash-investing/">Stash</a> all feature fractional trading, but Mulani said those apps are primarily used by U.S. residents. On the other hand, Gotrade is not available to U.S. residents because of financial regulations, so its main competitors are interactive brokers, Saxo Bank and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">eToro</a>.</p>
<p>Gotrade does not charge commission, custody, inactivity or dividend fees. Instead, it monetizes by collecting a small fee on the currency exchange from deposits, and interest generated from uninvested cash in brokerage accounts. The app is free to use, but plans to add a premium paid subscription program and virtual debit card that users can link to their accounts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rt1a4aAoJW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">Trading platform eToro to go public via SPAC merger in $10B deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trading platform eToro to go public via SPAC merger in $10B deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/embed/#?secret=Rt1a4aAoJW" data-secret="Rt1a4aAoJW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many of Gotrade’s users are people who have invested in their local stock markets, but weren’t able to trade U.S. stocks before. They vary widely in age, but 25- to 34-year-olds are the app’s biggest segment, and the average account size is about $500.</p>
<p>Gotrade acts as an introducing broker to Alpaca Securities LLC, a U.S. stock brokerage that is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and serves as an intermediary. Alpaca Securities splits its stock inventory into fractions, and Gotrade users can decide how many fractions they want to buy. The app also allows them to set a budget, and automatically calculates the amount of fractional shares they can afford through notional value trading.</p>
<p>User accounts are protected up to $500,000 by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and money goes through counterparties regulated in Singapore, like Rapyd, and the United States, including Alpaca and First Republic Bank. To protect users, Gotrade works only with fully-funded cash accounts without any margin facility. Mulani explained that a margin account effectively means people are borrowing money to invest, while a fully-funded account means that a user can only invest the money they have already deposited in their account. FINRA and Securities Exchange Commission regulations also mean accounts under $25,000 can only day trade, or buy and sell a security on the same day, up to three times every five trading days.</p>
<p>Like many investment apps aimed at first-time or relatively new traders, Gotrade includes educational content, like pop-ups with definitions for investment terms, and news articles about publicly-traded companies. Its new funding will be used for hiring and product development, with a strong focus on adding more in-app content.</p>
<p>In a statement, LocalGlobe partner Remus Brett said, “Over the past 100 years, U.S. stocks have delivered average annual returns of 10%. With compounding, an investment of $1,000 back then would be worth $13 million today. These returns have fueled wealth creation in the U.S. and other developed markets but most of the world has missed out. We believe Gotrade has the potential to help the world’s 99% gain access the same benefits that the 1% have. We are incredibly excited to be joining Rohit, David and Norman on this journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcast downloads have <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/03/podcast-listenership-download-data-on-the-rise.html">boomed</a> over the last year, and Kayak co-founder and tech entrepreneur Paul English became an avid, daily listener. But anyone who loves podcasts knows that podcast discovery can be challenging. Even the top streaming apps like Apple Podcasts and Spotify lack robust discovery tools &#8212; so last week, when Spotify acquired the podcast discovery app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Podz</a>, it validated the industry&#8217;s growing need for an easier way to uncover new shows.</p>
<p>Today, English launched <a href="https://www.moonbeam.fm/">Moonbeam</a>, a podcast discovery app that blends machine learning and human curation to present personalized recommendations. This might sound like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">what Podz is doing</a>, creating a newsfeed-style stream of content that users might like. But Moonbeam ups the ante by creating a creator-friendly platform, allowing podcast hosts to select clips of their show to feature on the app, too. The app also lets fans send a tip to the creator if they like their show enough (Moonbeam won&#8217;t take a cut, but there&#8217;s still that pesky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/apple-digs-in-heels-over-its-app-store-commission-structure-with-release-of-new-study/">in-app purchase fee</a> for podcasters to consider).</p>

<p>&#8220;Podz is one approach for discovery, but I think that there needs to be a lot of people working on this problem,&#8221; English told TechCrunch. &#8220;One thing that I think differentiates Moonbeam from Podz is that we have human editors.&#8221;</p>
<p>English was inspired by TikTok, which has become so ubiquitous in part because of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">its sophisticated discovery algorithm</a>. As an engineer, he would often redesign apps for fun, like Instagram or Twitter. But as he became interested in podcasting, he wanted to create an app that works like TikTok, but helps people find new podcasts. On the Beam section of the app, which is the equivalent of the For You page on TikTok, users are presented with clips of about a few minutes long. Based on how you interact with them, the algorithm learns what kind of podcasts you might want to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Machine learning can find better content for you than your friends can. We might find someone in Germany who has the same funny sense of humor you do, which might be a bit different than even your closet friends,&#8221; said English. &#8220;Machine learning is all about user clustering, where we find users that interacted with Moonbeam in ways similar to you. If we find users who like similar things that you like, we can share shows that they listen to on Moonbeam.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s tricky about apps like Moonbeam is that it will only get better as more people use the app. In its early stages &#8212; to be fair, the app launched today &#8212; many of the podcast recommendations come from relatively established shows. But with so many podcasts in existence (not every show is produced by NPR!), the challenge isn&#8217;t discovering &#8220;This American Life.&#8221; It&#8217;s finding emerging creators that might not get a shot in the podcasting industry without the backing of a major production studio. That&#8217;s what makes TikTok so valuable for creators &#8212; it&#8217;s very possible to become a viral sensation over night. What if there was an app that did that for podcasters?</p>
<p>Moonbeam plans to roll out software updates every two weeks, which will introduce a series of tools that allow listeners to interact with the teams behind their favorite podcasts. The first of these features &#8212; which is already in-app &#8212; is tipping. Soon, fans and podcasters alike will be able to make their own clips to share on the app. For now, podcast hosts who navigate to <a href="http://moonbeam.fm">Moonbeam&#8217;s website</a> can claim their show and create clips of it. It&#8217;s a bit clunkier to navigate than an app like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/sparemin-headliner/">Headliner</a>, but it&#8217;s functional.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a whole bunch of other tools we&#8217;re adding between the listener and the host,&#8221; said English. &#8220;Building that relationship is really important, and we want to do it directly in the player. We don&#8217;t want you to have to go to Facebook or some other site.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moonbeam can also function as a podcatcher, since you can listen to full episodes in the app and search for specific shows, even if they don&#8217;t appear on your Beam – but while podcatchers are abundant, good discovery apps aren&#8217;t. Hopefully, Moonbeam can help change that.</p>
