										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup Astra has received a key license from the Federal Aviation Administration, giving the green light for the company’s first commercial orbital launch at the end of the month.</p>
<p><a href="https://astra.com/">Astra</a> CEO Chris Kemp tweeted the news on Thursday, adding that the launch operator license through the FAA is valid through 2026. The new license is a modification of the company’s previous launch license and applicable to the current version of the company’s rocket, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>This is proving to be a big year for Astra.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tabletop gaming is in the middle of a historic boom, despite recent restrictions imposed on in-person gatherings by COVID. The tools adopted by game masters and casual players to play remotely are powerful but not always the easiest to use or adopt. <a href="https://www.playrole.com/">Role</a> hopes to change that with a super-accessible video platform focused on the social aspect of role-playing games, and it has raised a $2.75 million seed round to do so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say what has powered the incredible growth of the tabletop gaming space, which just a few years ago was perceived as a sleepy realm of basement-dwelling nerds, a niche within a niche. But it was a different kind of sleeping giant, one that has proven to be immensely diverse, valuable, and surprisingly tenacious in the face of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some platforms, like <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a> and <a href="https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php">Fantasy Grounds</a>, have seized on this opportunity to provide online video collaboration platforms for playing games like D&amp;D, strategy titles, and many others of the general tabletop type.</p>
<p>But Logan Dwight and Ian Hirschfeld, co-founders of Role, felt these approaches tended to emphasize the mechanics over what they felt was a more important aspect of RPGs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We asked ourselves, why is it that people, when they have all these options, choose to play D&amp;D on the internet? And what we figured out is, it&#8217;s the people,&#8221; said Dwight. &#8220;The game lives in the minds of the people, a shared social experience. It&#8217;s about the conversation, the face-to-face interactions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2191332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="695" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=768,521 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=1536,1042 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=2048,1389 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Play_Interface.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>This is the start of something new, they said — and big. As an analogue, they referred to the social gaming explosion a decade ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;People always find a way to play. Because we had social media platforms and mobile phones then, we were socializing over those — so we naturally looked for ways to play over them,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We&#8217;re at another one of those inflection points now with the explosion of online video and the creator economy in gaming. Video has become so good and so ubiquitous it&#8217;s becoming the dominant way people socialize — and then what naturally happens is we look for a way to play. And it turns out the, answer was right under our noses, and it&#8217;s been there since the &#8217;70s: it&#8217;s role playing, a game that takes the form of conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Role was designed from the ground up to smooth out and simplify how the complex mechanics of these games are implemented, putting the players visually and cognitively at the forefront. After all, when you&#8217;re playing D&amp;D or another game around the table, you spend most of your time looking at each other, not the game board — because it&#8217;s a game and you&#8217;re having fun with each other, right?</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easy to say the face-to-face interactions should be front and center, but the truth is these games are mechanically complicated and involve sheets, dice, maps, rulebooks and so on. Dwight said the problem here is not so much keeping them always in view, but making them simple and intuitive to access and involve in gameplay.</p>
<p>Take a character sheet with some attributes and associated bonuses, and a standard combat encounter. Depending on how well the GM has prepped, it may be that the dice rolls need to have bonuses added manually, and the results compared manually to the defending monster&#8217;s sheet. But if the bonuses, the dice, and the monster&#8217;s stats are all aware of one another, you know if you hit as soon as the die is cast.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191333" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191333" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2191333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Role's interface for building game systems." width="1024" height="597" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=680,397 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=1536,896 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=2048,1194 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Role-Builder_Interface.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2191333" class="wp-caption-text">It looks complicated, but compared with scripting it manually, this is a cakewalk.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This can be done in many games but it&#8217;s not always easy, and becomes much harder the further one goes from official, canon rulebooks. House rules are common enough, but these days there are entire variant game types being built out from open-license rulebooks that have no &#8220;official&#8221; support from a major gaming company like Wizards. Prepping a game for play online might be weeks of work that&#8217;s relatively technically demanding.</p>
<p>Some GMs and creators take pleasure in the intricacy of these systems, but as Dwight pointed out, the expansion of the community means more people are coming to this from non-gaming and non-tech backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core skills people are bringing to this are that they&#8217;re a writer or something. So the ability to create together needs to be really easy and really powerful,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We want to give people like&#8230; a Squarespace for tabletop RPGs. It&#8217;s a WYSIWYG editor, the RPG equivalent of a box of LEGO. You can make a whole set of templates for whatever game you want to run, tweak sheets, create animations, all without having to touch code, and you can share it easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has already seen major growth in user-created campaigns and variants for games designed to be built upon, like Mörk Borg and Lancer, with thousands being shared.</p>
<p>Role first raised money via Kickstarter (though the idea goes back to 2015), then via some angel funding, but this seed round brings in their first proper VC money. The $2.75M round is co-led by Konvoy and London Venture Partners, with whom Dwight said they were pleased to find willing partners who understood the opportunity perfectly. That&#8217;s a feat, considering the skyrocketing value and diversity of tabletop has taken even industry veterans by surprise.</p>
<p>The money is going towards effecting the lessons the company has learned from its early adopters, with a renewed focus on ease of use, accessibility, and extensibility. As for making money, the company intends to do so through a marketplace for games and scenarios, and for premium features like extra online storage and so on. But for regular users who just want to play with friends, Role is free to <a href="https://app.playrole.com/signup">sign up for</a> and use right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This January, Twitter acquired the newsletter platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, but until now its integration into Twitter has been minimal; sometimes when you write Twitter threads, you&#8217;ll be greeted with a &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1364481560506900482?lang=en">Hello, wordsmiths</a>&#8221; message that tells you about its newsletter tools).</p>
<p>Starting today, Twitter is testing a feature that brings Revue newsletters more prominently into the Twitter experience. Some users on web and Android will be able to see writers&#8217; Revue newsletters appear on their profile beneath their follower counts. If you click subscribe, you&#8217;ll be prompted to read a sample issue or subscribe using the email address connected to your Twitter account. Revue says this feature will also <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371224099446786">roll out on iOS</a> soon.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Today, we’re starting to test a feature that allows people to subscribe to your Revue newsletter directly from your Twitter profile. </p>
<p>It&#39;s available to all Revue creators immediately. To start though, your newsletters will show only for a test group on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/YDa1aOGeLM">pic.twitter.com/YDa1aOGeLM</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Revue (@revue) <a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371221524189186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The newsletter market is heating up — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/">Quora</a> have both recently released new monetization structures, Substack is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">valued at $650 million</a>, and Facebook is curating a slate of flashy newsletters on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a>. Even Tumblr is attempting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">cash in</a> on paywalled writing, though its user base <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">isn&#8217;t thrilled</a>. But with its new front-and-center integration on Twitter profiles, Revue may pick up steam too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons I switched to using their platform was the potential to link my newsletter with my Twitter feed &amp; make it easier for my followers to subscribe,&#8221; Revue writer <a href="https://twitter.com/jewelwickershow/status/1428372246582775813">Jewel Wicker</a> tweeted. &#8220;Happy the rollout has begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Revue takes a <a href="http://help.getrevue.co/en/articles/4754361-how-pricing-works-on-revue">5% cut of creators&#8217; earnings</a>, plus a standard 2.9%, plus $0.30 processing fee. So, if someone subscribes to your Revue newsletter for $5, you&#8217;ll take home $4.30. Comparatively, Substack takes 10% of writers&#8217; revenue plus processing fees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago’s startup scene is finally getting the attention it long felt it deserved.</p>
<p>By now it’s common knowledge that 2021 is shaping up to be a breakout year for the startup and venture capital worlds, surpassing years of strong results in a long-term bull market for tech-focused business upstarts. But no boom is equally distributed.</p>
<p>Different markets are seeing differing amounts of activity, driven in part by their startup ecosystem’s maturity and the ease with which external capital can be deployed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">African startups will set fresh venture capital records</a> this year, for example. But markets closer to the leading hubs of venture capital are seeing even stronger results, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/">Latin America demonstrates</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">China’s venture capital market, meanwhile, is easing</a> as others accelerate.</p>

<hr />
<p>Even inside the United States, there is divergence in how individual markets are performing. Chicago is an outlying benefactor from accelerating venture capital activity and the rise of remote investing. Data <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">collected by CB Insights</a>, for example, indicates that Chicago’s ability to attract venture funds has risen to new heights in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>While we anticipated Chicago might do well in a generally warm environment for startup investment, its results were better than we expected. To more fully understand just what is going on in the Windy City, The Exchange corresponded with <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a Midwest-focused venture capital fund; Moderne Ventures’ partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liza-benson-a8091828/">Liza Benson</a> (fresh off her firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/moderne-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-200m-targets-industry-digital-transformation/">raising $200 million for its second fund</a>); <a href="https://twitter.com/kitun">Scott Kitun,</a> of the Technori community and investing platform that has roots in the city; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-barnes-m1">Brian Barnes</a>, CEO of M1 Finance, a local unicorn in the fintech space that TechCrunch has covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/m1-finance/">extensively</a>.</p>

And the investors don’t expect that the back half of the year will be too different from the first. That means Chicago-based startups are in the middle of their best year of raising capital <em>ever</em>. Let’s talk about how that came to be.</p>
<h2>A venture capital run for the ages</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace at which Chicago-area startups have raised capital reached a new, high plateau starting in the second half of 2020. In historical terms, data indicates that Chicago was a beneficiary of an accelerated pace of venture investment that took hold globally once investors, concerned that startup growth could slow, shrugged off initial COVID shocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, startups were not affected as many feared, with many young tech companies actually accelerating during the pandemic’s first quarter of lockdowns, as many traditional businesses had to lean into software solutions and other services that startups sold.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early boost to Chicago’s venture totals in the final two quarters of 2020 was easily bested in the first quarter of 2021. And then the second quarter of this year crushed <em>that</em> record.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based Ample has raised a $160 million Series C to scale its battery swapping service, the largest round yet for the 8-year-old startup that wants to completely rethink how we use electric vehicles.</p>
<p><a href="https://ample.com/">Ample’s</a> approach is relatively straightforward: Cars equipped with the company&#8217;s modular battery pack can drive into one of Ample’s automated charging pod locations and swap out their depleted batteries for ones that are fully charged. The swapped-out batteries are then recharged in the pod and ready to be reinserted into another vehicle.</p>
<p>Although Ample’s battery swapping model is simple on paper, the company is proposing thinking about EV batteries in a completely different way. Instead of an EV battery being something that needs to be recharged, like an iPhone, Ample wants to turn them into things that can be swapped out, like batteries in a digital camera.</p>
<p>This latest nine-figure funding round is a sign that investors are paying attention. The internationally funded Series C was led by Moore Strategic Ventures with participation from PTT, a Thai state-owned oil and gas company, and Disruptive Innovation Fund. Existing investors Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company, and Singapore’s public transit operator SMRT also participated. Ample&#8217;s total funding is now $230 million.</p>
<p>“We realized that there&#8217;s this big elephant in the room with electric vehicles and [it&#8217;s that] nobody is that excited about spending an hour, two hours or three hours charging their vehicle,” Ample co-founder John de Souza said.</p>

<p>Industry’s response has been to develop technology like DC fast chargers, which have managed to shave charging time down to only 20 or 30 minutes. But de Souza said that improvements in charging time don’t get rid of fundamental problems: “[Fast charging] generates a lot of heat; the grid doesn’t support it,” he said. “Even if you could have batteries you charge in five minutes, you’d need chargers that were massively powerful and you’d need power plants around every corner to do it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ample is currently focused on fleets – it operates five battery swapping stations in the Bay Area for participating Uber drivers, and it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">locked in a partnership</a> with Sally, an EV rental company for taxi and last-mile deliveries in New York City. But the company sees its battery swapping service as suitable for consumers, as well. Ample co-founder Khaled Hassounah said battery swapping could also be useful for personal consumers who don’t have a good charging solution available to them, like people who live in apartment buildings. “We’re really a lot more focused on the cars that are coming on the road” rather than EVs that have already been manufactured, Hassounah added.</p>

Ample co-founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah. </p></div></p>
<p>The company says that its modular system means that drivers only need to carry around as much battery as they need. For Ample, that means less battery waste and less weight in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Much of Ample’s vision relies on buy-in from automakers. For example, the company is imagining that when a person goes to buy a car, the OEM could offer either a fixed battery option or a vehicle equipped with an Ample battery system.</p>
<p>Ample says it has validated its approach with 10 different car models by working directly with OEMs, and that none of them have required making modifications to the vehicle. That doesn’t mean that there are no interfaces between the battery and the car that need to be altered &#8212; there are things like voltage cables or a cooling line, for example &#8212; but that the actual architecture of EVs is simpler than one might think.</p>
<p>“The marketing departments at the OEMs want to tell you that … ‘This is a super-duper battery that is very well integrated with the car; there&#8217;s no way you can separate it,’” Hassounah said. “The truth of the matter is they’re built completely separately and so true for almost &#8212; not almost, for every battery in the car, including a Tesla.</p>
<p>“Since we&#8217;ve built our system to be easy to interface with different vehicles, we&#8217;ve abstracted the battery component … from the vehicle,” he added.</p>
<p>Ample said it&#8217;s working with five different OEMs right now, “some of the largest OEMs out there,” de Souza said, though he declined to specify which ones. He added that growing demand from fleets goes hand in hand with conversations with OEMs, which are eager to sell vehicles.</p>
<p>It could be an attractive proposal because much of the cost of an electric vehicle is its battery system. The market has seen a version of this idea from Chinese automaker Nio, which offers consumers the option of purchasing a vehicle with or without a battery (for the latter option, Nio leases the batteries). Under the leasing option, drivers shave ¥70,000 ($10,800) off the price of a vehicle. Nio has already completed more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/">2.4 million battery swaps</a> for Chinese drivers, founder William Li said in May.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Ample is focused purely on scaling: deploying with large customers in new cities. Interestingly, de Souza added that the company is getting a lot of interest from governments who want to shift to electric transportation but don’t have the requisite charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The question is, how can we get more miles and be electric, rather than build more infrastructure?” Hassounah said. “If you go and deploy a million fast chargers and no one uses them, we haven&#8217;t achieved anything.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Leaders and senior management everywhere are grappling with how (or not) to bring employees back to the office. It’s a high-stakes decision: Fifty-eight percent of workers said they will look for new jobs if they can’t work remotely, according to a<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-survey-finds-employees-want-remote-work-post-pandemic/"> FlexJobs survey</a>.</p>
<p>An often overlooked and/or cobbled-together piece of this puzzle is compensation. And inside the transition to hybrid work, compensation planning encapsulates a cacophony of nuances for founders, people leaders and compensation experts.</p>
<p>Here are just a few new questions this group needs to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we adjust salaries for people who have moved to different regions?</li>
<li>Do we alter pay for employees performing the same role, with the same title, when one is remote and the other is in-office?</li>
<li>How can we educate geographies that aren’t as familiar with the value of equity as is, say, Silicon Valley?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we’ve seen in recent weeks, the answers to these questions are different for us all.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/pay-cut-google-employees-who-work-home-could-lose-money-2021-08-10/"> Google employees who work from home</a> may experience a pay cut. <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">Adobe workers</a> can self-select what days they work remotely, up to 50% of the time, with no salary impact. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/linkedin-allow-most-employees-work-remotely-reversing-course-2021-07-29/"> LinkedIn</a> just loosened its policy, allowing employees to work from home permanently.</p>

			The first step in developing a compensation plan — regardless of your company’s stance on distributed work — is determining how your team’s pay compares with the market.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Regardless of your startup’s stance on the topic, having a consistent compensation philosophy that you apply to your evolving workplace has a unicorn-sized influence on important growth metrics: attracting and keeping top talent, as well as creating a culture of trust and performance.</p>
<p>As the CEO of a compensation intelligence company, I see four common mistakes that startups commit when compensation planning that hinder successful remote or hybrid workforces. Here are the ways to sidestep them.</p>
<h2>1. Using subpar data for competitive analysis</h2>
<p>The first step in developing a compensation plan — regardless of your company’s stance on distributed work — is determining how your team’s pay compares with the market. To understand market rates, you need one thing: data.</p>
<p>If you’re moving from a strictly office-based environment to a hybrid model, 2019 data won’t work. While it’s tempting to search for free data online or use survey data that your company has purchased in the past, both approaches have risks. Traditional compensation survey information is stale, limited and often not verified. And spreadsheets are hyperprone to error and security risks because they involve manual, and often super laborious, work.</p>
<p>In a world that’s still reacting to a pandemic, only fresh, real-time, accurate benchmarks and pay ranges are sufficient. Both must reflect aggregated information about what others in your segment are paying employees — by experience level, role, department, geography, industry and company size.</p>
<p>For example, technology startups need different data sources than global financial services organizations. Both need information geared toward companies of a similar size and stage. Software engineer salaries need to reflect those of similar roles, with nuances for those that specialize in machine learning, data science, etc.</p>
<p>You’d be shocked how often self-reported data on free websites is inaccurate and unverified. As you seek a credible intelligence source for your compensation data, a data source must:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency response is a time-sensitive business. When fires burn or a driver crashes their car, seconds can mean the difference between saving lives and watching a situation spiral rapidly out of control. For fire and police departments, getting teams on site can be challenging, what with the vagaries of traffic and bad routing.</p>
<p>Houston-headquartered <a href="https://paladindrones.io">Paladin</a> is a startup building a custom drone hardware and software solution for cities to be able to respond to emergencies faster and with better data. After years of development, the company is publicly unveiling its Knighthawk and Watchtower products.</p>
<p>The Knighthawk is a custom-made drone designed for the specific needs of emergency response personnel. It comes complete with two cameras — one 10x zoom optical and one thermal — to provide the best video feeds on a developing situation at both day and night with only a half second latency. Importantly, the drone has a time range of 55 minutes and can travel multiple miles away to reach a site, according to the company. Launch time can be as short as a few seconds from when a 911 call comes in.</p>

<p>To manage the drones and watch the video feeds, operators use the company’s Watchtower software (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1407493274">available as an app</a>) to place a pin on a map to direct the drone to the likely site of an emergency. Once there, uploaded video feeds will display in the app as well as in a 911 center’s existing computer-aided dispatch systems, a topic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">we covered quite a bit in our RapidSOS EC-1 from a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>The public launch is a huge step forward for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/28/paladin-drones-picks-up-1-3m-to-give-first-responders-a-live-feed-of-emergencies/">which TechCrunch last profiled in 2019</a> as it was emerging from Y Combinator with a $1.3 million seed from the likes of Khosla, Correlation Ventures, and Paul Buchheit. Back then, the focus was on building software to integrate with an off-the-shelf DJI drone. Paladin was experimenting with a beta Android app where an operator could place a pin on a map and direct the drone to a site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Yet, that model proved insufficient for the task. CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava said that as the company developed its product, it learned it needed to own the hardware stack as well. “The drones that we were using weren’t purpose-built for automation,” he said. “We ended up coming up with our own communication technology for our drones … so that we won’t lose connection.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191613" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191613" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191613" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/divy1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191613" class="wp-caption-text">CEO and co-founder Divy Shrivastava. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paladin Drones.</p></div></p>
<p>Since the company’s founding in 2018, it has responded to about 1,600 emergencies, according to its own internal data. The company has spent prodigious hours with departments in two locations — Memorial Villages in Houston and Orange Township in Ohio — responding to a handful of calls per day at specific hours.</p>
<p>That restriction hints at what has been one of the toughest challenges for the drone startup: regulations. The FAA has put in place strict rules around visual line of sight for operators of drones. In order to realize its vision of a completely seamless and easily deployed system, Paladin has had to collect extensive data and present it to the FAA to get operating waivers, which the agency offers through a “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/public_safety_gov/public_safety_toolkit/media/TBVLOS_Waiver_Final.pdf">First Responder Tactical Beyond Visual Line of Sight</a>” exception. So far, it has secured these types of waivers for the two cities it works with, and Shrivastava is confident that the company has developed a repeatable process for any new cities that want to purchase its products.</p>
<p>Installation is relatively simple, according to Shrivastava. The drones themselves can be placed anywhere, even “a parking lot,” and are often stationed at a police department or firehouse. No special hardware or sensors or guidelines need to be installed in the city for the drones to process the terrain or understand their surroundings. Some software integration is required to connect drones into the computer-aided dispatch system used by 911 call takers.</p>
<p>With the public launch and more proof points on the board, the company is focusing on ramping up sales and “our long-term goal is to have every single fire, police and first response agency use us,” Shrivastava said. The team has expanded to about eight, although the company’s other co-founder, Trevor Pennypacker, departed in late 2019, and now works at Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First of all, we’ve got a fancy new name. While “Robotics Roundup” was nothing if not very technically accurate, it lacked the kind of panache one ought to strive for when rounding up robotics. Actuator, on the other hand &#8212; that’s a mover and shaker.</p>
<p>It’s a name you can take to the bank (or at least run by the legal department for clearance). To mark this momentous occasion, we employed our resident graphic design genius Bryce to sketch up something befitting our rebrand.</p>
<p>We’re also using the opportunity to announce that Actuator will be coming soon to an inbox near you as a free TechCrunch newsletter. All of this fun change seems extra fitting, given that this happens to be the 25th edition of the roundup. You can find all of the older updates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">under our Actuator tag</a> if you want to catch up.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following for a while, you’ve got the gist of what the newsletter is about: a digestible look into the week’s robotics news. We cover all of the startups making waves and the big companies impacting the industry, along with the most fascinating updates in the world of robotic research, as well as dives into labor concerns and various ethical issues stemming from automation and AI.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2191372" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="164" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg 578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=150,43 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=300,85 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/im-a-robot.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>If all of that sounds good, you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">can sign up here to get Actuator in your inbox</a> as soon as the first issue hits. I’m told you may have to prove you&#8217;re not a robot, so apologies in advance to all of the robots reading this. But hey, if you’ve gotten this far, you’ll figure it out.</p>

<p>Following an earlier <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-winding-down-realsense-camera-business">report from CRN</a>, Intel has since confirmed with TechCrunch that it will be winding down its 3D imaging platform, RealSense. It’s always a shame to see these sorts of forward-looking initiatives go away. And certainly Intel has been leaning pretty heavily on the division as a leading indicator of its efforts to remain relevant as the industry evolves.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve covered RealSense’s involvement in drones, robotics and AR/VR. In June of last year, we covered the platform’s embrace of 5G connectivity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191382" style="width: 698px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191382" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191382 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg" alt="" width="688" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg 688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Intel-RealSense_2-e1629322774563.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191382" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intel</p></div></p>
<p>“We are winding down our RealSense business and transitioning our computer vision talent, technology and products to focus on advancing innovative technologies that better support our core businesses and IDM 2.0 strategy,” the company said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “We will continue to meet our commitments to our current customers and are working with our employees and customers to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Translation: The company is choosing to focus its core competency. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html">IDM 2.0</a> refers specifically to the new chipmaking strategy into which the company is pumping $20 billion. Understandable, but it’s always hopeful to see big companies like Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm really go all in on such forward-facing technologies.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF4DML7FIWk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Boston Dynamics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/atlas-slugged/">made news this week</a>, ostensibly for another slick viral video, this one featuring the Hyundai-owned company’s humanoid Atlas robot. By now we’re all well aware of the fact that the company makes impressive robots and highly effective YouTube videos that launch a million Black Mirror and Terminator jokes on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’ve seen Atlas do some really impressive stuff in person at BD’s headquarters, and I’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s currently capable of. So, while Atlas is extremely cool, I didn’t find the recent parkour video especially shocking. What did catch me off guard, however, was the fact that the company also used the opportunity to essentially publish some outtakes from the film.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190175" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190175" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2190175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Recording-2021-08-16-at-3.17.55-PM.2021-08-16-15_20_47.gif" alt="" width="800" height="417" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>A six-minute, behind-the-scenes video featured a montage of Atlas falling on its face. Like any great skateboarding video, there are a few gratuitous shots included that demonstrate that, regardless of how advanced the system is, there are still going to be some face-planting, gasket-blowing falls that leave its chest scuffed in a pool of its own fluid. The company notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>During filming, Atlas gets the vault right about half of the time. On the other runs, Atlas makes it over the barrier, but loses its balance and falls backward, and the engineers look to the logs to see if they can find opportunities for on-the-fly adjustments.</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s probably enough news of shuttered divisions and bodily robot harm for this week. A couple of fundraising rounds are worth noting.</p>
<p>First is Rapid Robotics, which has been on a fundraising tear of late. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/rapid-robotics-raises-another-36-7m/">new $36.7 million Series B</a> values the manufacturing robotics company at $192.5 million and marks its third(!) fundraising round in a year that started with a seed raise.</p>

<p>CEO Jordan Kretchmer cites pandemic-fueled manufacturing bottlenecks as a big source of interest in the company:</p>

The fellow Bay Area-based firm announced its own $8 million seed round this morning for an intriguing mix of robotics and 3D printing designed at speeding up house construction. The company is still in its early stages, but it claims its technology can dramatically reduce the need for manual labor and shrink house construction time from nine months to 30 days.</p>

It’s also relatively uniformly constructed as far as self-contained meals go, and is therefore easier to automate.</p>

<p>And speaking of pizza robots, before we leave you this week, a note to check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec1-operations/">EC-1 on Nuro</a>. Here’s a fun anecdote from Domino’s chief innovation officer that seems to ring true across the robotic spectrum:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things we laugh about is how customers constantly talk to the bot. It’s almost like they think it’s ‘Knight Rider.’ It’s very common for customers to thank it or say goodbye, which is great because that indicates we’re creating an engaging experience that they’re not frustrated by.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reels are coming to Facebook in the U.S. The company this morning announced it will begin testing a new feature, Facebook Reels, which will give Facebook users the ability to create and share short-form video content directly within the News Feed or within Facebook Groups. The addition is an expansion of tests launched earlier this year in India, Mexico and Canada, which had focused on bringing short-form videos to Facebook users, including by sharing existing Instagram Reels to Facebook, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-india-idUSKBN2B10AV">as had been reported</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook today says it will also test a new feature that will give Instagram creators in the U.S. the option to have their Instagram Reels shown as recommended content on Facebook. If the creators opt in, their videos will appear in the &#8220;Reels&#8221; section in users&#8217; News Feed, alongside other Reels created on Facebook.</p>
<p>There will be many places where users can create Reels from Facebook, as the new feature launches.</p>
<p>Initially, you&#8217;ll be able to tap a &#8220;Create&#8221; button from the Reels section that appears as you scroll the News Feed, while you&#8217;re watching Reels or by tapping on &#8220;Reels&#8221; at the top of your News Feed. From here, users will gain access to a standard set of creation tools, including those for video capture, music selection, camera roll import, timed text and more &#8212; much like you would have access to on Instagram.</p>
<p>For audio, you can either choose a song from Facebook&#8217;s music library, record your own original audio or even use someone else&#8217;s audio, if their Reels are set to &#8220;public.&#8221; There are also a variety of effects and editing tools to choose from, including a timer for recording Reels hands-free, tools to speed up or slow down a part of the video or your original audio and a number of augmented reality effects created either by Facebook or third-party developers.</p>
<p>Facebook told us that, for the time being, &#8220;most&#8221; of Instagram Reels&#8217; features will also be available on Facebook Reels. But other features &#8212; like Remix (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">its take on TikTok&#8217;s side-by-side videos called Duets</a>) &#8212; will be added over time as the test scales to more people. The user interface for Reels may also evolve over time to look somewhat different from Reels on Instagram, depending on user feedback.</p>
<p>After a Reel has been created, you can choose who to share it with &#8212; such as &#8220;Friends,&#8221; a specific audience like &#8220;Friends except&#8230;&#8221;, or the general public. The latter is the default setting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1DGBlz1PRJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/">Instagram&#8217;s TikTok rival, Reels, rolls out ads worldwide</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram&#8217;s TikTok rival, Reels, rolls out ads worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/embed/#?secret=1DGBlz1PRJ" data-secret="1DGBlz1PRJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The feature will be made available within Facebook Groups, where Reels can be created then shared with members of the community who have similar interests.</p>
<p>Users can also choose to tap into &#8220;My Reels&#8221; to view past creations. And you can browse Reels created by others in the News Feed, and in select Groups and Pages &#8212; where you can like, comment on or share them, just as you could with any other type of post. Reels will now be surfaced in Search results, too, Facebook told us.</p>
<p>Like much of what appears on Facebook, Reels will be recommended to users based on what people are interested in, what they engage with and what&#8217;s broadly popular. This will apply to both the shared Instagram Reels and the Facebook Reels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191358" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191358" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191358 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?w=645" alt="" width="645" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png 1081w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=768,810 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=645,680 645w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reels-in-Groups.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191358" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook (Reels in Groups)</p></div></p>
<p>The company explained the decision to replicate the Reels product inside Facebook is a result of consumers&#8217; growing interest in video, and particularly short-form video. Today, video accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, in fact. On <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/29/facebook-fb-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">Facebook&#8217;s latest earnings call</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked that Reels was &#8220;already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram,&#8221; given the popularity of short-form video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video, and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first,&#8221; he had told investors.</p>
<p>But Facebook also understands that people have different communities and audiences on Instagram and Facebook, so simply offering a cross-posting option may not have sufficed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TU1mCjOXj2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/how-tiktok-decides-who-to-make-famous/">How TikTok decides who to make famous</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How TikTok decides who to make famous&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/how-tiktok-decides-who-to-make-famous/embed/#?secret=TU1mCjOXj2" data-secret="TU1mCjOXj2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, for existing Reels creators who do want to tap into Facebook&#8217;s large audience, a new option will allow them to opt-in to have their Reels shared to Facebook. This could be useful for those producing more general-interest Reels content.</p>
<p>These shared Reels will display the creator&#8217;s Instagram username, as well, which could help them build a following. Creators&#8217; Reels can also be remixed, with the creator&#8217;s permission, and their original audio can be re-used in other people&#8217;s Reels &#8212; again, much like on TikTok.</p>
<p>This feature will also be introduced as a &#8220;test,&#8221; Facebook said.</p>
<p>While Instagram is already beginning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/instagrams-tiktok-rival-reels-rolls-out-ads-worldwide/">monetize Reels through ads</a>, Facebook told us that Reels on Facebook don&#8217;t currently include ads. But, &#8220;we plan to roll out ads in the future,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191356" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191356" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191356" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=289,300 289w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=768,798 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=654,680 654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IG-Reels-Opt-In-Flow.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191356" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook (sharing Instagram Reels to Facebook opt-in flow)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reels, which is Facebook&#8217;s answer to the growing threat of TikTok, first </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">launched to global audiences a year ago</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. This launch alone was not enough to win Instagram the top spot as the world&#8217;s most downloaded mobile app. In 2020,</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> that win went to TikTok</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, after years where Facebook-owned apps dominated the top charts. And TikTok today continues to sit at the top of App Store charts in terms of both app installs and consumer spending, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">according</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to multiple</span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/q2-2021-index/"> third-party reports. </a></p>
<p>For Facebook, TikTok represents an existential threat to its business. If users&#8217; time and attention are being spent elsewhere, Facebook&#8217;s advertisers could then follow, impacting Facebook&#8217;s bottom line. So instead of competing with TikTok in just one app, Facebook is now using two. And it&#8217;s leveraging its apps&#8217; interoperability to ensure the best content can easily flow to both places.</p>
<p>The company is also directly investing in the creator community in hopes of tipping the scales back in its direction.</p>
<p>In July, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">announced</a> a plan to invest more than $1 billion in creators across both Facebook and Instagram through 2022. This fund will reward more than just Reels&#8217; creators, to be clear, as it will also pay out bonuses for videos with in-stream ads enabled or for enabling IGTV ads, among other things. It will also reward top creators who have invited fans to send them tips in the form of a virtual currency, &#8220;stars.&#8221; But Instagram Reels, and now Facebook Reels, will be looped into that initiative.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tw6K9ci8mn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook will lure creators with $1 billion in payments</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Today, Facebook said it will announce additional bonus programs and seed funding in the months ahead that will pay out bonuses for Reels on Facebook. These will be funded from that $1 billion commitment. The company declined to share details on this front, but this news alone indicates Facebook Reels is far more than just &#8220;a test&#8221; in Facebook&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>The new Facebook Reels features will begin to roll out starting today, August 19, in the U.S. It will first be available to a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of U.S. users on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>The feature will continue to operate in India, Mexico and Canada, as well.</p>

<p>The Bangalore-based startup said on Thursday that CRED users can now lend to one another at an interest rate of up to 9% annually.</p>
<p>Kunal Shah, founder and chief executive of CRED, said the startup is rolling out this feature, dubbed CRED Mint, initially to some users after testing this internally for months.</p>
<p>“We’re super excited about this because it’s the first time our community members will be able to invest in one another directly. It’s going to focus on high-quality, low-risk, but much better, inflation-beating returns you can get on your money,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India’s CRED valued at $2.2 billion in new $215 million fundraise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/embed/#?secret=m1edtp9M1d" data-secret="m1edtp9M1d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://cred.club">CRED</a> members have on average 200,000 Indian rupees ($2,685) sitting in their savings accounts, the startup said. &#8220;At up to 9% interest, CRED Mint will help these users, India’s most creditworthy individuals, to be rewarded for responsible financial behaviour with a smarter way to make idle money work for them. CRED members can apply for early access to Mint,&#8221; CRED said.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer lending is not a new business idea. Several large and small firms operate in this space, but CRED appears to be uniquely positioned to solve one of the biggest challenges this category faces: <a href="https://www.capitalmind.in/2018/06/the-folly-of-retail-investors-lending-people-money-without-collateral-and-that-too-online/">defaulters</a>. According to some estimates, more than 20% of individuals taking a loan in a peer-to-peer service don’t pay it back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CRED members have a credit score of 750 or higher, making them the most trustworthy audience to provide financial services. On CRED, a user has to have a credit score of 750 or higher to join the app.</p>
<p>“We do believe that the product-market fit of our offering is very strong. We believe that this could set a new benchmark for what fintechs should be doing,” said Shah. CRED also does lending itself &#8212; which is available to limited members &#8212; and has disbursed about $269 million to customers in loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even at the scale of CRED Cash, the default rate has historically been less than 1%. To reduce risk further, the invested money will be routed directly to an escrow account held by CRED’s NBFC partner, LiquiLoans, and diversified across 200+ borrowers on average,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>For CRED Mint, the startup has partnered with LiquiLoans, an RBI-registered P2P NBFC. Shah said CRED will eventually partner with more players. Users can invest between 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,345) to 1 million rupees ($13,450) in about two minutes, and also request withdrawal at any time with no penalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The withdrawal process is fully online, and the money with interest will be returned to the investor within a working day. As a digital platform, CRED reduces friction, inefficiency, commissions and overheads to pass on higher earnings for members,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>CRED &#8212; backed by Tiger Global, Ribbit Capital and Sequoia Capital India and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.2 billion in an April round</a> &#8212; has also received inbound requests from internal investors to raise a new round of over $300 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposed terms value CRED at about $4 billion post-money. CRED isn&#8217;t currently in advanced stages to close a round. Shah declined to comment on fundraise talks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use AirPods Pro or AirPods Max, your mobile Netflix watching is about to get a bit more immersive. Yesterday, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix confirmed</a> that it has begun rolling out spatial audio support on iPhone and iPad on iOS 14 after the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Airpodsmax/comments/p6oiss/spatial_audio_is_now_working_on_the_netflix_app/">spotted</a> by a Reddit user.</p>
<p>Netflix joins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html">streaming competitors</a> like HBO Max, Disney+ and Peacock in enabling this feature, while other popular apps like Amazon Prime Video and YouTube still don&#8217;t have this functionality. Still, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/netflix-spatial-audio-support-roll-out/">Netflix said</a> the rollout won&#8217;t be immediate — users who have the update should be able to toggle it on or off in the Control Center.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple has been emphasizing its spatial audio features. The company first announced that it would bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-bringing-spatial-audio-to-airpods-pro/">spatial audio to AirPods Pro</a> during the WWDC conference in 2020 — during this year&#8217;s conference, Apple added that Apple Music subscribers would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">gain access</a> to spatial audio and lossless audio streaming at no extra charge. This even supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211775">dynamic head tracking</a>, which adjusts the sound when you move your head. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android version</a> of the Apple Music app also supports spatial and lossless audio. In February, Spotify said it would roll out a high-end subscription service, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify HiFi</a>, which would enable lossless audio, though there&#8217;s been no news since.</p>
<p>Last month, Netflix revealed that it started looking toward mobile gaming in addition to its original movies and television series. The company has already experimented with interactive entertainment with projects like &#8220;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&#8221; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">&#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games</a>.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,” the company said in its <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">quarterly earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Spatial audio is popular among video game players — so while this update will enhance the streaming video experience on iPhone and iPad, perhaps we&#8217;ll see this feature at play in eventual Netflix mobile games, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eaze <a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/eaze-to-acquire-multi-state-retail-leader-green-dragon">this week announced </a>significant plans to expand into one of the U.S.&#8217;s largest cannabis delivery services. One of the original on-demand cannabis delivery services, the Bay Area-based company is set to acquire cannabis retailer and cultivator Green Dragon, which operates in the hot markets of Colorado and Florida. Combined with existing operations in California and Michigan, the deal would find Eaze operating in America’s four largest cannabis markets.</p>
<p>Less than two years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/eaze-out-of-cash-to-burn/">it was unclear if Eaze would have enough cash to continue operating</a>. According to TechCrunch’s reporting, it was experiencing significant trouble raising funds and went through unannounced layoffs. The company was switching from providing delivery services to operating as a delivery dispensary. Eaze was effectively the Uber of weed, attempting to become the Amazon of weed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014 by Keith McCarty, Eaze has raised over $255 million to date. The company cycled through leadership and has seen three CEOs, with Rogelio Choy leading it since 2019. Former CEO <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sf-culture/article/eaze-sf-cannabis-delivery-ceo-bank-fraud-15973138.php">Jim Patterson recently pleaded guilty in a $100 million</a> scheme to deceive banks into processing credit and debit payments in cannabis purchases. The case is similar to one<a href="https://www.eaze.com/press/u-s-district-court-dismisses-tcpa-lawsuit-against-eaze"> brought against Eaze in 2019</a>, though the company denied involvement and is not a defendant in the case against Patterson. The future was unclear, but now two years later, it&#8217;s raising more funds and is on track to become the nation’s largest multi-state cannabis delivery service.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s new App Store Guidelines aim to crack down on fraud and scams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/embed/#?secret=VCJQ7ig4dN" data-secret="VCJQ7ig4dN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company switched gears in 2019 and closed a previously announced Series D financing round of $90 million in August 2020. This year, Eaze is trying to close a $75 million Series E, with 80% of the funds already committed. The company expects this round to close in November. Eaze tells TechCrunch that this round will value the company at more than $700 million — double its fundraising valuation in 2019. The anticipated funding will be used to drive additional retail expansion.</p>
<p>Eaze Chief Strategy Officer Cory Azzalino justifies the higher valuation as such: “The company is fundamentally different. Even our California operations are significantly larger than they were back in 2019 from a revenue standpoint. But also just in terms of future growth opportunities. There’s a substantial increase in our addressable market. Florida, Michigan and Colorado create some $6 billion worth of incremental market size.”</p>
<p>Eaze is quickly becoming a major national cannabis operator. Earlier in 2021, it announced that its delivery service will be moving into Michigan, the hottest cannabis market in the Midwest. If the Green Dragon purchase closes, the company also gains delivery operations in Colorado (now approving cannabis delivery companies) and Florida (a state with a massive medical marijuana market). According to a press release, Green Dragon saw more than one million transactions in 2020, and its Colorado stores grew 39% in 2020. In July, the company turned to Florida, announcing the opening of its first two dispensaries in the state and its intention to secure 20 more locations by the end of 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The timing couldn’t be better for Eaze. In June 2021 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple changed an App Story policy</a>, allowing licensed cannabis dispensaries to list and sell cannabis products (flower, edibles and vapes) directly from an iOS app. Eaze jumped, becoming the first retailer to sell weed from an iPhone app. However, purchases are only possible in Eaze’s two markets: California and (soon) Michigan.</p>
<p>“Eaze has achieved exponential growth over the last two years by successfully shifting to vertical operations and continuing to grow our loyal customer base,” said Eaze CEO Rogelio Choy said in a released statement. “Green Dragon’s airtight operations in Colorado and expansion into Florida’s booming market adds key operational capabilities to our national footprint and cements our leadership as California’s largest MSO. Together, we are well-positioned to leverage the market’s explosive growth now and into the future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok’s plans to collect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/biometrics/">biometric</a> identifiers from its users has prompted concern among U.S. lawmakers, who are demanding the company reveal exactly what information it collects and what it plans to do with that data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045829-klobuchar-letter-to-tiktok">a letter sent earlier this month addressed to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew</a>, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune, (R-SD) say they are &#8220;alarmed&#8221; by the recent change to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a>’s privacy policy, which allows the company to “automatically collect biometric data, including certain physical and behavioral characteristics from video content posted by its users.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">first reported details of the new privacy policy back in June</a>, when TikTok said it will seek “required permissions” to collect “faceprints and voiceprints&#8221; where required by law, but failed to elaborate on whether it’s considering federal law, states laws or both (<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/biometrics/biometric-data">only a handful of U.S. states</a> have biometric privacy laws, including Illinois, Washington, California, Texas and New York).</p>
<p>Klobuchar and Thune’s letter asks TikTok to explicitly explain what constitutes a “faceprint” and “voiceprint”, as well as to explain how this data will be used and how long it will be retained. The senators also quizzed TikTok on whether any data is gathered for users under the age of 18; whether it makes any inferences about its users based on the biometric data it collects; and to provide a list of all third parties that have access to the data.</p>

<p>“The coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in online activity, which has magnified the need to protect consumers’ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a>,” the letter reads. “This is especially true for children and teenagers, who comprise more than 32% of TikTok’s active users and have relied on online applications such as TikTok for entertainment and for interaction with their friends and loved ones.”</p>
<p>TikTok has been given until August 25 to respond to the lawmakers’ questions. A TikTok spokesperson did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time TikTok’s excessive data collection plans have come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the company paid out $92 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claiming it unlawfully collected users’ biometric data and shared it with third parties. This came after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">the FTC in 2019 slapped TikTok with a $5.7 million fine </a>for violating the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires apps to receive parental permission before collecting a minor&#8217;s data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every country has its own bundle of laws, rules and regulations, and they change on a regular basis, making it an enormous challenge to keep up with it all. That usually requires large staffs filling in spreadsheets, and other unwieldy processes. <a href="https://www.regology.com/">Regology</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to change that by putting some automation to work on the problem.</p>
<p>Today the company announced an $8 million Series A led by Acme Capital with participation from existing investors Gagarin Capital and Pine Wave Investments.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Mukund Goenka spent more than 15 years working in the banking industry where he saw firsthand the difficulties in keeping up with regulations and the financial consequences of failing to do so. He formed Regology to provide large global companies with a way to stay on top of these myriad regulations.</p>
<p>Goenka says that his company started by compiling a database of laws. &#8220;We have a very large database of laws that is constantly updated, covering geographies from five continents, and a number of countries and jurisdictions. We also cover the lawmaking process of going from bills all the way to laws to regulations and a number of agencies and their regular updates on a daily basis. And it covers a number of industries and topic areas as well,&#8221; Goenka explained.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t stop there though. They also give customers a framework for automating compliance wherever they are doing business, and they constantly review the laws and updates to help ensure their customers are staying in compliance over time. Their target market is large Fortune 500 companies, and while Goenka couldn&#8217;t name specific ones, he did say that it included some of the largest tech companies and biggest banks.</p>

<p>The company launched in 2017 and today has 20 full-time employees, with plans to at least double that by the end of the year. He says that being diverse is essential in a business that is already looking at the regulatory environment in 25 countries. Understanding how each of these countries works is essential to the business, and that requires a diverse workforce to pull off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Goenka says that the company has been remote from day one, long before COVID. While there is still a small office in Palo Alto, he intends to remain mostly remote, even when it&#8217;s considered safe to reopen offices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bay Area-based Diamond Age this week announced that it has raised $8 million. The seed round is led by Prime Movers Lab and Alpaca VC and features a slew of additional firms, including Dolby Family Ventures, Calm Ventures, Gaingels, Towerview Ventures, GFA Venture Partners and Suffolk Construction.</p>
<p>The startup looks to put a slew of key emerging technologies to work in service of building houses with fewer workers in a significantly truncated time frame. Diamond Age claims that when, fully realized, its tech will be able to reduce manual human labor by 55% and shrink the construction time on a single family home from nine months to 30 days. Part of this funding will go toward putting the processes in place to construct a 1,100-square-foot “demonstration house” as proof of concept.</p>
<p>“We need to build high-quality affordable single-family homes for the next generation striving for the American dream,” co-founder and CEO Jack Oslan said in a release, “and the only way we can solve this problem is with automation.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the company relies on robotic and 3D printing solutions. The former involves a set of 26 different robotic arm attachments to assist with the construction. That tech is coupled with a gantry-based 3D printing technology designed to construct interior and exterior walls for the structure.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company is looking to target the housing crunch in its Bay Area backyard. The systems will be available to construction companies through a RaaS (robotics as a service) rental model. Pricing specifics for the system have not been revealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://uipath.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UiPath</a> came seemingly out of nowhere in the last several years, going public last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">in a successful IPO</a> during which it raised over $527 million. It raised $2 billion in private money prior to that with its final private valuation coming in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">at an amazing $35 billion</a>. UiPath CEO Daniel Dines will be joining us on a panel on automation at TC Sessions: Saas on October 27th.</p>
<p>The company has been able capture all this investor attention doing something called Robotic Process Automation, which provides a way to automate a series of highly mundane tasks. It has become quite popular, especially to help bring a level of automation to legacy systems that might not be able to handle more modern approaches to automation involving artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">Gartner found that RPA</a> was the fastest growing category in enterprise software.</p>
<p>In point of fact,  UiPath didn&#8217;t actually come out of nowhere. It was founded in 2005 as a consulting company and transitioned to software over the years. The company took its first VC funding, a modest $1.5 million seed round in 2015, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

<p>As RPA found its market, the startup began to take off, raising gobs of money including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/uipath-rpa-series-d/">a $568 million round in April 2019</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">$750 million in its final private raise</a> in February 2021.</p>
<p>Dines will be appearing on a panel discussing the role of automation in the enterprise. Certainly, the pandemic drove home the need for increased automation as masses of office workers moved to work from home, a trend that is likely to continue even after the pandemic slows.</p>
<p>As the RPA market leader, he is uniquely positioned to discuss how this software and other similar types will evolve in the coming years and how it could combine with related trends like no-code and process mapping. Dines will be joined on the panel by investor Laela Sturdy from Capital G and ServiceNow&#8217;s Dave Wright where they will discuss the state of the automation market, why it&#8217;s so hot and where the next opportunities could be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Dines, the conference will also include Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi, Salesforce&#8217;s Kathy Baxter and Puppet’s Abby Kearns, as well as investors Casey Aylward and Sarah Guo, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a stimulating day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aileen Lee is one of the most prestigious and successful venture capitalists of the past decade. Before starting her own firm in Cowboy Ventures, Lee was a partner at KPCB for more than 12 years. Her portfolio includes DocSend, Ironclad, Philz Coffee, StyleSeat and many, many more.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Lee join us alongside one of her portfolio company founders, Guild Education&#8217;s Rachel Carlson, on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-with-cowboy-ventures-and-guild-education?ref=2981607eb662">Click to register for free!</a></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live brings founders and their investors together to pop the lid off of the black box that is fundraising. How did they meet? Why did they choose each other? What got them to yes? How do they work together now?</p>
<p>These are the pieces of the fundraising process that often aren&#8217;t covered in your average &#8220;how to fundraise&#8221; blog posts and programming, and we&#8217;re here to get these questions answered.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> also features the ECL Pitch-off, which gives folks in the audience the chance to raise their hand and pitch their startup to our guests, who will give their live feedback.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. Let&#8217;s get to know our guests.</p>
<p>Lee has been one of the most sought-after investors in Silicon Valley for as long as I&#8217;ve been in tech. A founding partner at All Raise, she is committed to diversity and inclusion and has an eye for talent, realizing that the former often precedes the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She&#8217;s been on the Midas List a handful of times, and is also listed as one of Forbes&#8217; most influential people.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson founded Guild Education in 2015 and has led the company since. Guild has raised upwards of $370 million from investors that include General Catalyst, Felicis, Bessemer and more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about how to get to yes, what sings in a pitch deck and how they operate as partners to this day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors and AT&amp;T will be rolling out 5G connectivity in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads, and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>Executives said in a media briefing that the rollout of the 5G architecture will also bring benefits for GM models that are 4G LTE-equipped, such as those from model year 2019 and newer. Once available, vehicle owners of select models “will easily migrate to the new network infrastructure once available,” the companies said in a news release.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s going to be a performance boost and improvements as AT&amp;T improves their infrastructure, so that the vehicles connected with 4G capabilities, model year 19 and beyond, they will also start to perceive an improvement in their performance,” GM’s VP of global connected services, Santiago Chamorro, said during a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>Tom DeMaria, GM’s executive director of global connected services, added that the performance boost will not require GM pushing a significant software update to vehicles, but that the vehicles will be “seamlessly migrated.”</p>
<p>Faster and more reliable connectivity is key to many automakers’ market plans, which nearly across the board involve complex in-car software features and wireless over-the-air updates to keep everything from the music system to (if it’s an electric vehicle) the battery operational. It will also be key for other technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which are swiftly becoming another key way that automakers seek to distinguish themselves to drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The push for renewable energy has brought offshore wind power to the forefront of many an energy company&#8217;s agenda, and that means taking a very close look at the ocean floor where the installations are to go. Fortunately <a href="https://www.bedrockocean.com/">Bedrock</a> is here to drag that mapping process into the 21st century with its autonomous underwater vehicle and modern cloud-based data service.</p>
<p>The company aims to replace the standard &#8220;big ship with a big sonar&#8221; approach with a faster, smarter, more modern service, letting companies spin up regular super-accurate seafloor imagery as easily as they might spin up a few servers to host their website.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re the first cloud-native platform for seafloor data,&#8221; said Anthony DiMare, CEO and cofounder (with CTO Charlie Chiau) of Bedrock. &#8220;This is a big data problem — how would you design the systems to support that solution? We make it a modern data service, instead of like a huge marine operation — you&#8217;re not tied to this massive piece of infrastructure floating in the water. Everything from the way we move sonars around the ocean to the way we deliver the data to engineers has been rethought.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/">Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/embed/#?secret=zvlftUI4Vv" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The product Bedrock provides customers is high-resolution maps of the seafloor, made available via Mosaic, a familiar web service that does all the analysis and hosting for you — a big step forward for an industry where &#8220;data migration&#8221; still means &#8220;shipping a box of hard drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, DiMare explained, this data was collected, processed, and stored on the ships themselves. Since they were designed to do everything from harbor inspections to deep sea surveys, they couldn&#8217;t count on having a decent internet connection, and the data is useless in its raw form. Like any other bulky data, it needs to be visualized and put in context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190870" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190870" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190870" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg" alt="Example of data in the Mosaic system from Bedrock, showing a map and trails of data points." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190870" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;These datasets are extremely large, tens of terabytes in size,&#8221; said DiMare. &#8220;Typical cloud systems aren&#8217;t the best way to manage 20,000 sonar files.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current market is more focused on detailed, near-shore data than the deep sea, since there&#8217;s a crush to take part in the growing wind energy market. This means that data is collected much closer to ordinary internet infrastructure and can be handed off for cloud-based processing and storage more easily than before. That in turn means the data can be processed and provided faster, just in time for demand to take off.</p>
<p>As DiMare explained, while there may have been a seafloor survey done in the last couple decades of a potential installation site, that&#8217;s only the first step. An initial mapping pass might have be made to confirm the years-old maps and add detail, then another for permitting, for environmental assessments, engineering, construction, and regular inspections. If this could be done with a turnkey automated process that produced even better results than crewed ships for less money, it&#8217;s a huge win for customers relying on old methods. And if the industry grows as expected to require more active monitoring of the seafloor along every U.S. coast, it&#8217;s a win for Bedrock as well, naturally.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190871" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190871" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg" alt="CG render of the AUV." width="1024" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=1536,793 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=2048,1058 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-2.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190871" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p>
<p>To make this all happen, of course, you need a craft that can collect the data in the first place. &#8220;The AUV is a piece of technology we built solely to enable a data product,&#8221; said DiMare, but noted that, originally, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to spec out what it looked like to use an off the shelf system,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But if you want to build a hyper-scalable, very efficient system to get the best cost per square meter, you need a very specific set of features, certain sonars, the compute stack&#8230; by the time we listed all those we basically had a self-designed system. It&#8217;s faster, it&#8217;s more operationally flexible, you get better data quality, and you can do it more reliably.&#8221;</p>
<p>And amazingly, it doesn&#8217;t even need a boat — you can grab it from the back of a van and launch it from a pier or beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning one of the restrictions we put on ourselves was &#8216;no boats.&#8217; And we need to be able to fly with this thing. That totally changed our approach,&#8221; said DiMare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190869" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190869" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190869" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg" alt="View of the AUV on a beach" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=2048,1377 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190869" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AUV packs a lot into a small package, and while the sensor loadout is variable depending on the job, one aspect that defines the craft is its high-frequency sonar.</p>
<p>Sonars operate in a wide range of frequencies, from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands of hertz. Unfortunately that means that ocean-dwelling creatures, many of which can hear in that range, are inundated with background noise, sometimes to the point where it&#8217;s harmful or deters them from entering an area. Sonar operating about 200 kHz is safe for animals, but the high frequency means the signal attenuates more quickly, reducing the range to 50-75 meters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously worthless for a ship floating on the surface — much of what it needs to map is more than 75 meters deep. But if you could make a craft that always stayed within 50 meters of the seabed, it&#8217;s full of benefits. And that&#8217;s exactly what Bedrock&#8217;s AUV is designed to do.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwxPzQKd3ig?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The increased frequency of the sonar also means increased detail, so the picture its instruments paint is better than what you&#8217;d get with a larger wave. And because it&#8217;s safe to use around animals, you can skip the (very necessary but time-consuming) red tape at wildlife authorities. Better, faster, cheaper, <em>and</em> safer is a hell of a pitch.</p>
<p>Today marks the official launch of Mosaic, and to promote adoption Bedrock is offering 50 gigs of free storage — of any kind of compatible map data, since the platform is format-agnostic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of data out there that&#8217;s technically &#8220;public&#8221; but is nevertheless very difficult to find and use. It may be a low-detail survey from two decades ago, or a hyper-specific scan of an area investigated by a research group, but if it were all in one place it would probably be a lot more useful, DiMare said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately we want to get where we can do the whole ocean on a yearly basis,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer shift to buying online during the global pandemic — and keeping that habit — continues to boost revenue for makers of developer tools that help e-commerce sites provide better shopping experiences.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of the e-commerce infrastructure companies continuing to attract investor attention, and at a speedy clip, too. It closed on a $50 million Series B round from Tiger Global. This is just six months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A</a> round, led by Inovia, and follows a $4.8 million seed round in 2020.</p>
<p>The company is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, a.k.a. the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience, CEO Brian Anderson told TechCrunch. By doing this, the back end of the store, essentially where all the magic happens, can be updated and maintained without changing the front end.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is not new, but how the customer relates to it keeps changing,” he said. “The technology for online shopping is not up to snuff — when you click on something, everything has to reload compared to an app like Instagram.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nacelle raises $4.8M for its headless e-commerce platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/embed/#?secret=uZYi451zY7" data-secret="uZYi451zY7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>More people shopping on their mobile devices creates friction due to downloading an app for each brand. That is “sucking the fun out of shopping online,” because no one wants that many apps on their phone, Anderson added.</p>
<p>Steven Kramer, board member and former EVP of Hybris, said via email that over the past two decades, the e-commerce industry went through several waves of innovation. Now, maturing consumer behaviors and expectations are accelerating the current phase.</p>
<p>“Retailers and brands are struggling with adopting the latest technologies to meet today’s requirements of agility, speed and user experience,” Kramer added. “Nacelle gives organizations a future-proof way to accelerate their innovation, leverage existing investments and do so with material ROI.”</p>
<p>Data already shows that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">COVID-era trends accelerated e-commerce by roughly five years</a>, and Gartner predicts that <a href="https://commercelayer.io/docs/core-concepts/composable-commerce">50% of new commerce capabilities will be incorporated as API-centric SaaS services</a> by 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those kinds of trends are bringing in competitors that are also attracting investor attention — for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/">Shopistry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/italys-commerce-layer-raises-16m-led-by-coatue-for-its-headless-commerce-platform/">Commerce Layer</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/vue-storefront/">Vue Storefront</a> are just a few of the companies that raised funding this year alone.</p>
<p>Anderson notes that the market continues to be hot and one that can’t be ignored, especially as the <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf">share of online retail sales grows</a>. He explained that some of his competitors force customers to migrate off of their current tech stack and onto their respective platforms so that their users can get a good customer experience. In contrast, Nacelle enables customers to keep their tech stack and put components together as they see fit.</p>
<p>“That is painful in any vertical, but especially for e-commerce,” he said. “That is your direct line to revenue.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nacelle itself grew 690% in the past year in terms of revenue, and customers are signing multiyear contracts, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson, who is an engineer by trade, wants to sink his teeth into new products as adoption of headless commerce grows. These include providing a dynamic layer of functionality on top of the tech stack for storefronts that are traditionally static, and even introducing some livestream capabilities later this year.</p>
<p>As such, Nacelle will invest the new round into its go-to-market strategy and expand its customer success, partner relations and product development. He said Nacelle is already “the de facto standard” for Shopify Plus merchants going headless.</p>
<p>“We want to put everything in a tailor-made API for e-commerce that lets front-end developers do their thing with ease,” Anderson added. “We also offer starter kits for merchants as a starting point to get up-and-running.”</p>
