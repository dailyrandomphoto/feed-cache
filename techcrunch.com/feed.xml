										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> is an extremely powerful issue tracking and project management tool, but it&#8217;s not the world&#8217;s most intuitive piece of software either. Spreadsheets, on the other hand, are pretty much the de facto standard for managing virtually anything in a business. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that there are already a couple of tools on the market that bring a spreadsheet-like view of your projects to Jira or <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220382/jira-cloud-for-google-sheets-official?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview">connect it</a> to services like Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The latest entrant in this field is <a href="https://jxl.app/">JXL Spreadsheets for Jira</a> (and specifically Jira Cloud), which was founded by two ex-Atlassian employees, Daniel Franz and Hannes Obweger. And in what has become a bit of a trend, Atlassian Ventures invested in JXL earlier this year.</p>
<p>Franz <a href="https://goodnews.click/">built the Good News news reader</a> before joining Atlassian while his co-founder previously founded Radiant Minds Software, the makers of Jira Roadmaps (now Portfolio for Jira), which was acquired by Atlassian.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;Jira is so successful because it is awesome,&#8221; Franz told me. &#8220;It is so versatile. It&#8217;s highly customizable. I&#8217;ve seen people in my time who are doing anything and everything with it. Working with customers [at Atlassian] &#8212; at some point, you didn&#8217;t get surprised anymore, but what the people can do and track with JIRA is amazing. But no one would rock up and say, &#8216;hey, JIRA is very pleasant and easy to use.'&#8221;</p>
<p>As Franz noted, by default, Jira takes a very opinionated view of how people should use it. But that also means that users often end up exporting their issues to create reports and visualizations, for example. But if they make any changes to this data, it never flows back into Jira. No matter how you feel about spreadsheets, they do work for many people and are highly flexible. Even Atlassian would likely agree because the new <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/work-management">Jira Work Management</a>, which is currently in beta, comes with a spreadsheet-like view and Trello, too, recently went this way when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/atlassian-launches-a-whole-new-trello/">launched</a> a major update earlier this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137766" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137766" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/keyboard-shortcuts.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> JXL</p></div></p>
<p>Over the course of its three-month beta, the JXL team saw how its users ended up building everything from cross-project portfolio management to sprint planning, backlog maintenance, timesheets and inventory management on top of its service. Indeed, Franz tells me that the team already has some large customers, with one of them having a 7,000-seat license.</p>
<p>Pricing for JXL seems quite reasonable, starting at $1/user/month for teams with up to 10 users. Larger teams get increasingly larger discounts, down to $0.45/user/month for licenses with over 5,000 seats. There is also a free trial.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the company can offer this kind of pricing is because it only needs a very simple backend. None of a customer&#8217;s data sits on JXL&#8217;s servers. Instead, it sits right on top of Jira&#8217;s APIs, which in turn also means that changes are synced back and forth in real time.</p>
<p>JXL is now available in the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Marketplace</a> and the team is actively hiring as it looks to build out its product (and put its new funding to work).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is set to send a payload to the Moon in 2023, using its larger (and infrequently used) Falcon Heavy launch vehicle. The mission will fly a lander <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/2021/4/13/astrobotic-space-x">built by space startup Astrobotic</a>, which itself will be carrying NASA&#8217;s VIPER, or Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (this is the agency that loves torturing language to come up with fun acronyms, after all).</p>
<p>The launch is currently set for later in the year, and this would be Falcon Heavy&#8217;s first Moon mission if all goes to plan. It would not, however, be SpaceX&#8217;s first lunar outing, since the company has booked missions to launch lunar landers as early as 2022 on behalf of both Masten and Intuitive Machines. Those would both employ Falcon 9 rockets, however, at least according to current mission specs. Also, all of the above timelines so far exist only on paper, and in the business of space, delays and schedule shifts are far from unusual.</p>
<p>This mission is an important one for all involved, however, so they&#8217;re likely to prioritize its execution. For NASA, it&#8217;s a key mission in its longer-term goals for Artemis, the program through which it seeks to return humans to the Moon, and eventually establish a more permanent scientific presence there both in orbit and on the surface. Part of establishing a surface station will rely on using in-situ resources, of which water would be a hugely important one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Astrobotic won the contract to deliver VIPER on behalf of NASA last year. The mission profile includes landing the payload on the lunar South Pole, which is the intended target landing area for NASA&#8217;s Artemis missions involving human astronauts. The lander Astrobotic is sending for this task is its Griffin model, which is a larger craft vs. its Peregrine lander, giving it the extra space required to carry the VIPER, and making it necessary to use SpaceX&#8217;s heavier lift Falcon Heavy launch vehicle.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s ambitious target of landing astronauts back on the Moon by 2024 is in flux as the new administration looks at timelines and budgets, but it still seems committed to making use of public-private partnerships to pave the way, whenever it does attain that goal. This first Griffin mission, along with an earlier planned Peregrine landing, are part of NASA&#8217;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which sought private sector partners to build and deliver lunar landers with NASA as one customer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In light of the Microsoft-Nuance deal, we dug into the AI venture capital market. What’s happening on the startup side in the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) space?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">huge purchase</a> of healthtech AI company Nuance led the technology news cycle this week. The $19.7 billion transaction is Microsoft’s second-largest to date, only beaten by its purchase of LinkedIn some years ago.</p>
<p>For the AI space, the sale is a coup. Nuance was already a public company, but to see Microsoft offer a firm premium over its public-market value demonstrates the value that AI technology can have to wealthy companies. For startups working in the AI space, the Nuance deal is good news; the value of AI revenue was repriced by the acquisition’s announcement &#8212; and for the better.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-goes-all-in-on-healthcare-with-19-7b-nuance-acquisition/">light of the mega-deal</a>, The Exchange dug into the AI venture capital market. What’s happening on the startup side of the coin in the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) space?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>To get a handle on the situation, we’ve compiled Q1 2021 and historical venture capital investment data via <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a>, spoken to an active venture capitalist with a focus on AI-powered startups, and heard from a couple of startups recently featured on CB Insights&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/artificial-intelligence-top-startups/">list of leading AI upstarts</a> for their take on the recent news.</p>

For AI startups, it’s a great time to be in the market.</p>
<p>This morning, we’ll start with a look into recent venture capital activity in the AI/ML market and its historical context. Then we’ll talk to Zetta Ventures’ Jocelyn Goldfein and a few companies in the AI space. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>A venture capital rush</h2>
<p>According to historical data compiled by PitchBook, venture capital investment into U.S.-based, AI-focused startups is enjoying a strong start to the year. Per the group’s provided dataset, from the start of 2021 through April 12, or the first 101 days of the year, 442 deals in the space were worth $11.65 billion.</p>
<p>In 2020, the same query for U.S.-based startups working in the AI and ML space &#8212; the line between ML and AI is blurrier than ever &#8212; turned up 1,601 rounds worth $27.49 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, the password management service that competes with the likes of <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> and <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a>, today announced a major push beyond the basics of password management and into the infrastructure secrets management space. To do so, the company has acquired secrets management service <a href="https://secrethub.io/">SecretHub</a> and is now launching its new 1Password Secrets Automation service.</p>
<p>1Password did not disclose the price of the acquisition. According to CrunchBase, Netherlands-based SecretHub never raised any institutional funding ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>For companies like 1Password, moving into the enterprise space, where managing corporate credentials, API tokens, keys and certificates for individual users and their increasingly complex infrastructure services, seems like a natural move. And with the combination of 1Password and its new Secrets Automation service, businesses can use a single tool that covers them from managing their employee&#8217;s passwords to handling infrastructure secrets. 1Password is currently in use by more then 80,000 businesses worldwide and a lot of these are surely potential users of its Secrets Automation service, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies need to protect their infrastructure secrets as much if not more than their employees’ passwords,&#8221; said Jeff Shiner, CEO of <span class="il">1Password</span>. &#8220;With <span class="il">1Password</span> and Secrets Automation, there is a single source of truth to secure, manage and orchestrate all of your business secrets. We are the first company to bring both human and machine secrets together in a significant and easy-to-use way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the acquisition and new service, 1Password also today announced a new partnership with GitHub. &#8220;We&#8217;re partnering with <span class="il">1Password</span> because their cross-platform solution will make life easier for developers and security teams alike,&#8221; said Dana Lawson, VP of partner engineering and development at GitHub, the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. &#8220;With the upcoming GitHub and <span class="il">1Password</span> Secrets Automation integration, teams will be able to fully automate all of their infrastructure secrets, with full peace of mind that they are safe and secure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After his last startup, Framed Data, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/14/square-brings-on-the-team-behind-framed-data-a-predictive-analytics-startup/">acquired by Square</a>, Thomson Nguyen began exploring new ideas. While an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins, Nguyen interviewed hundreds of small business owners and realized that many pay hundreds of dollars in fees to maintain a business checking account. “Most small businesses are low margin, high cash flow, so they don’t have $4,000 just laying around,” Nguyen told TechCrunch. “We found in our analysis that micro-SMBs actually end up paying on average $450 in overdraft fees a year.”</p>
<p>Nguyen’s new startup <a href="https://www.hatchcard.com/">Hatch</a> recently launched its first two products and announced today it has secured a total of $20 million in funding from investors like Kleiner Perkins, Foundation Capital, SVB and Plaid’s founders. The fintech’s Hatch Business Checking accounts cost $10 a month, don’t charge non-sufficient funds (NSF) or overdraft fees and includes cashback offers. Eligible account holders can also enroll in Hatch Cover, which covers overdrafts up to $100, or apply for lines of credit.</p>
<p>Some of Hatch’s customers have hundreds of employees, but Nguyen said the startup primarily focuses on businesses with up to 20 people. Many are run by only one person, who might be setting up a business account for the first time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hatch draws on Nguyen’s professional and personal backgrounds. Framed Data, a predictive analytics company, was acquired by Square in 2016. He worked as Square Capital’s head of data science before becoming an entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins in 2018, focusing on fintech and machine learning problems. As a child of immigrants, Nguyen saw firsthand the challenges small businesses can face.</p>

<p>“During my time at Kleiner, the goal was to think about what other problems I wanted to solve. I definitely wanted to solve additional problems within small businesses. I think a lot of what I appreciate about Square’s mission of economic empowerment for small businesses also really resonated with my own family story,” he said. “My parents immigrated here from Vietnam after the war and were like so many immigrants to the States to start small businesses. Figuring out how to use whatever talents I had to try to make it easier to start small businesses was definitely something I wanted to pursue.”</p>
<p>Hatch’s <a href="https://www.hatchcard.com/about">leadership team</a>, including alumni of fintech companies and major financial institutions like Square, Stripe, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, talked to small business owners, and found that recent immigrants or people without credit histories were paying the majority of bank fees. The startup raised a $5 million seed round from Kleiner Perkins, Abstract Ventures and former Square executive Gokul Rajaram in January 2019, then a $14 million Series A round from Foundation Capital, SVB and Plaid founders William Hockey and Zack Perret in February 2020.</p>

<p>Hatch Business Checking began rolling out in January and currently has 4,000 users. The company’s inception coincided with an especially brutal time for many small business owners, as they <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17656">weathered the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic impact</a> and navigated the process of getting government aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>
<p>“Initially I was a little worried, but as I was talking to all of our small business customers and even as I was doing these interviews, I realized that amidst a global pandemic, it’s been humbling to see the grit and perseverance of small business owners trying to innovate and learn,” Nguyen said.</p>
<p>For example, some of Hatch’s users are restaurants that hadn’t done deliveries before, but quickly signed up for multiple on-demand platforms like Postmates or Uber Eats. Others include accountants and lawyers who figured out how to move their practices online.</p>
<p>Hatch serves businesses in a wide range of sectors, including first-time entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“There’s been this interesting trend of sole proprietors and individual creators who maybe had a side hustle, and after they were laid off during COVID, they decided, okay, I’m going start a small business,” Nguyen said. “Through our research, that’s actually how a lot of small businesses think of themselves, not as Thomson Tacos LLC for example, but just as myself, as Thomson, a person who is running this business.”</p>
<p>The startup uses machine learning to automate Hatch Business Checking’s online sign-up process and its know your customer (KYC) and know your business (KYB) requirements. This includes confirming business incorporation paperwork, social security or employer ID numbers and regulatory compliance like Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) checks. Hatch can approve applications in less than five minute. Once that process is complete, customers get a MasterCard virtual number and can link external bank accounts. Hatch also uses machine learning for real-time fraud and risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Nguyen said Hatch launched its overdraft coverage program because “we found it is a really great way for folks to get themselves out of a bind, finish the point sale and then top up their account later.”</p>
<p>If a business with a Hatch Business Checking account needs more working capital, it can apply for a Hatch Business Line of Credit, or loans between $200 to $5,000 at an APR of 18% to 24%. Hatch does not do hard credit checks and sees the credit lines as an alternative to the payday lenders or check cashers that customers without a FICO score or subprime ratings often use.</p>
<p>To screen loan applicants, Hatch uses information from their Business Checking accounts, including activity from connected point-of-sale systems. This allows Hatch to see real-time data and forecast a business’ potential forward revenue. It also enables the company to approve credit lines in as little as two hours.</p>
<p>“A hard credit check is actually quite difficult for recent immigrants or Americans who had trouble in their recent history. If you declare bankruptcy, it takes seven years to get it struck off your credit history,” said Nguyen. “To us, I think the more important factors are whether you actually have a business and whether that business is growing. We have a couple of examples of folks who declared bankruptcy three or four years ago, but they have a business that is booming and growing, and we’re happy to underwrite or originate that line of credit for them.”</p>
<p>But he emphasizes that Hatch, a signatory of the <a href="http://www.borrowersbillofrights.org/">Small Business Owner’s Bill of Rights</a>, does not see lending as permanent solution and will not encourage its users to take on unnecessary debt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aYI7dy9GKT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/despite-the-pandemic-small-business-optimism-persists/">Despite the pandemic, small business optimism persists</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Despite the pandemic, small business optimism persists&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/despite-the-pandemic-small-business-optimism-persists/embed/#?secret=aYI7dy9GKT" data-secret="aYI7dy9GKT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I think the reason we feel so strongly about this is that we want to win when our customers win,” Nguyen said. “If all we did was lending, then you would almost have a misalignment of incentives where you want to encourage lending retention. Given our business bank accounts and our revenue model, which is $10 a month and debit interchange, we really win when the business continues to exist. So for us, it’s almost a matter of building that financial independence for our customers.”</p>
<p>Hatch currently covers overdrafts and credit lines with its own balance sheet. “Because we’re using machine learning data to understand our own risk position, the main focus right now is to understand how businesses grow and model those products accordingly,” said Nguyen.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, Kleiner Perkins partner Ilya Fushman told TechCrunch, “Small businesses account for nearly half of all economic activity in the U.S., but are often hamstrung by the banking ecosystem today. Hatch is democratizing access to the financial resources that small businesses need to start out and grow. Thomson and team are already working with thousands of SMBs and are uniquely suited with the technology and industry expertise to help them grow with the financial resources they need to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his statement about Foundation Capital’s investment, partner Charles Moldow said, “Our view at Foundation Capital is that the next phase of financial innovation is confluence: a coming together of lending and mobile banking. Hatch is a breaker wave of this movement for small businesses. That Thomson and his team were able to so rapidly stand up the only full-solution, mobile-first bank offering for SMBs is a testament to what they can and will accomplish.”</p>
<p>Since Hatch’s Series A, it has grown its team from eight people to 48, hiring remotely during the pandemic. Its plan is to expand its Business Checking accounts and continue building products for the estimated 40 million small businesses in the United States.</p>
<p>“When I think of the future products we can provide, it really centers around how do we make sure that a small business succeeds in starting up correctly and efficiently, and scaling their business,” said Nguyen. “Sometimes that’s financial products like our business accounts. Potentially, it could be software products that help you actually start that business. So there’s a wealth of different ideas and directions in which we can take Hatch.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; (FOB) has <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/267806285017646-the-oversight-board-is-accepting-user-appeals-to-remove-content-from-facebook-and-instagram/">announced</a> an operational change that looks intended to respond to criticism of the limits of the self-regulatory content-moderation decision review body: It says it&#8217;s started accepting requests from users to review decisions to leave content up on Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>The move expands the FOB&#8217;s remit beyond reviewing (and mostly reversing) content takedowns &#8212; an arbitrary limit that critics said aligns it with the economic incentives of its parent entity, given that Facebook&#8217;s business benefits from increased engagement with content (and outrageous content drives clicks and makes eyeballs stick).</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, users have been able to appeal content to the Board which they think should be <i>restored</i> to Facebook or Instagram. Now, users can also appeal content to the Board which they think should be <i>removed</i> from Facebook or Instagram,&#8221; the FOB writes, adding that it will &#8220;use its independent judgment to decide what to leave up and what to take down&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our decisions will be binding on Facebook,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The ability to request an appeal on content Facebook wouldn&#8217;t take down has been added across all markets, per Facebook. But <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/users-can-now-appeal-content-left-up-on-facebook-or-instagram-to-the-oversight-board/">the tech giant said</a> it will take some &#8220;weeks&#8221; for all users to get access as it said it&#8217;s rolling out the feature &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in waves to ensure stability of the product experience&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>While the FOB can now get individual pieces of content taken down from Facebook/Instagram &#8212; i.e. if the Board believes it&#8217;s justified in reversing an earlier decision by the company <em>not</em> to remove content &#8212; it cannot make Facebook adopt any associated suggestions vis-a-vis its content moderation policies generally.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Facebook has never said it will be bound by the FOB&#8217;s policy recommendations; only by the final decision made per review.</p>
<p>That in turn limits the FOB&#8217;s ability to influence the shape of the tech giant&#8217;s approach to speech policing. And indeed the whole effort remains inextricably bound to Facebook which devised and structured the FOB &#8212; writing the Board&#8217;s charter and bylaws, and hand picking the first cohort of members. The company thus continues to exert inescapable pull on the strings linking its self-regulatory vehicle to its lucrative people-profiling and ad-targeting empire.</p>
<p>The FOB getting the ability to review content &#8216;keep ups&#8217; (if we can call them that) is also essentially irrelevant when you consider the ocean of content Facebook has ensured the Board <em>won&#8217;t</em> have any say in moderating &#8212; because its limited resources/man-power mean it can only ever consider a fantastically tiny subset of cases referred to it for review.</p>
<p>For an oversight body to provide a meaningful limit on Facebook&#8217;s power it would need to have considerably more meaty (i.e. legal) powers; be able to freely range across all aspects of Facebook&#8217;s business (not just review user generated content); and be truly independent of the adtech mothership &#8212; as well as having meaningful powers of enforcement and sanction.</p>
<p>So, in other words, it needs to be a public body, functioning in the public interest.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s controversial Oversight Board starts reviewing content moderation cases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/embed/#?secret=DEwqUE1l70" data-secret="DEwqUE1l70" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instead, while Facebook applies its army of in house lawyers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">fight <em>actual</em> democratic regulatory oversight and compliance</a>, it has splashed out to fashion this bespoke bureaucracy that can align with its speech interests &#8212; handpicking a handful of external experts to pay to perform a content review cameo in its crisis PR drama.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, the FOB has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-takedowns-and-issues-a-slew-of-policy-tweaks/">mostly moved the needle in a speech-maximizing direction</a> so far &#8212; while expressing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/facebooks-oversight-board-already-a-bit-frustrated-and-it-hasnt-made-a-call-on-trump-ban-yet/">some frustration</a> at the limited deck of cards Facebook has dealt it.</p>
<p>Most notably, the Board still has a decision pending on whether to reverse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">Facebook&#8217;s indefinitely ban</a> on former US president Donald Trump. If it reverses that decision Facebook users won&#8217;t have any recourse to appeal the restoration of Trump&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>The only available route would, presumably, be for users to report future Trump content to Facebook for violating its policies &#8212; and if Facebook refuses to take that stuff down, users could try to request a FOB review. But, again, there&#8217;s no guarantee the FOB will accept any such review requests. (Indeed, if the board chooses to reinstate Trump that may make it harder for it to accept requests to review Trump content, at least in the short term (in the interests of keeping a diverse case file, so&#8230; )</p>

<h2>How to ask for a review after content isn&#8217;t removed</h2>
<p>To request the FOB review a piece of content that&#8217;s been left up a user of Facebook/Instagram first has to report the content to Facebook/Instagram.</p>
<p>If the company decides to keep the content up Facebook says the reporting person will receive an Oversight Board Reference ID (a ten-character string that begins with &#8216;FB&#8217;) in their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/support/?helpref=faq_content">Support Inbox</a> &#8212; which they can use to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/346366453115924">appeal its &#8216;no takedown&#8217; decision to the Oversight Board</a>.</p>
<p>There are several hoops to jump through to make an appeal: Following on-screen instructions Facebook says the user will be taken to the <a class="_5dwo _9fua" href="https://www.oversightboard.com/login/">Oversight Board website</a> where they need to log in with the account to which the reference ID was issued.</p>
<p>They will then be asked to provide responses to a number of questions about their reasons for reporting the content (to &#8220;help the board understand why you think Facebook made the wrong decision&#8221;).</p>
<p class="_9fu7">Once an appeal has been submitted, the Oversight Board will decide whether or not to review it. The board only selects a certain number of &#8220;eligible appeals&#8221; to review; and Facebook has not disclosed the proportion of requests the Board accepts for review vs submissions it receives &#8212; per case or on aggregate. So how much chance of submission success any user has for any given piece of content is an unknown (and probably unknowable) quantity.</p>
<p>Users who have submitted an appeal against content that was left up can check the status of their appeal via the FOB&#8217;s website &#8212; again by logging in and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">using the reference ID.</span></p>
<p>A further limitation is time, as Facebook notes there&#8217;s a time limit on appealing decisions to the FOB</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Bear in mind that there is a time limit on appealing decisions to the Oversight Board. Once the window to appeal a decision has expired, you will no longer be able to submit it,&#8221; it writes in its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/346366453115924">Help Center</a>, without specifying how long users have to get their appeal in (we asked Facebook to confirm this and it&#8217;s 15 days). </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might think that a startup whose primary customers are tourism bureaus would have had a pretty rough 2020, but CEO Monir Parikh said <a href="https://bandwango.com">Bandwango</a>&#8216;s customer base more than doubled in the past year,  growing from 75 to 200.</p>
<p>In Parikh&#8217;s words, the Murray, Utah-based startup has built a platform called the Destination Experience Engine and designed for &#8220;connecting businesses with communities.&#8221; That means bringing together offers from local restaurants, retailers, wineries, breweries, state parks and more into package deals — such as the <a href="https://bandwango.com/newport-beach-dine-pass-case-study/">Newport Beach Dine Pass</a> and the <a href="https://www.traveliowa.com/getinspireddetails/get-your-iowa-state-park-passport/418/">Travel Iowa State Passport</a> — which are then sold by tourism bureaus.</p>
<p>Obviously, the pandemic dealt a big blow to tourism, but in response, many of these organizations shifted focus to deals that could entice locals to support nearby businesses and attractions. Parikh predicted that even after the pandemic, tourism bureaus will continue to understand that &#8220;local-focused tourism is going to be part of the mix of what we do — locals are your ambassadors, they are the best organic marketing channel.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, Parikh said that as new privacy regulations make it harder to collect data about online visitors, it&#8217;s becoming more challenging for tourism bureaus to &#8220;to prove to their funders that they&#8217;re having an economic impact.&#8221; So where bureaus were content in the past to advertise deals and then link out to other sites where customers could make the actual purchases, selling the deals themselves has become a new way to prove their worth.</p>

<p>With last year&#8217;s growth, Bandwango has raised $3.1 million in seed funding led by Next Frontier Capital, with participation from Kickstart, Signal Peak Ventures, SaaS Ventures, and Ocean Azul Partners. (The startup had previously raised only $700,000 in funding.)</p>
<p>Parikh said that until now, Bandwango has been a largely full service option. The selling point, after all, is that the tourism bureaus already &#8220;have great relationships with these local businesses,&#8221; but the startup can handle the hard work of &#8220;trying to wrangle 200 of their local businesses&#8221; to offer deals and accept those deals in-store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mantra is: We become your back office,&#8221; he added. But with the new funding, he wants the startup to build a self-serve product as well. &#8220;What I say to my team is that a 90-year-old grandmother, as well as 12-year-old teenager, should be able to come into our platform and say, &#8216;I want to create a local savings program or an ale trail&#8217; and do it end-to-end, without our assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Bandwango is currently focused on providing a white-label solution to its customers (rather than building a consumer deal destination of its own), Parikh said it eventually distribute these deals more broadly by creating its own &#8220;private label brands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the issues with deploying a machine learning application is that it tends to be expensive and highly compute intensive.  <a href="https://www.deeplite.ai/">Deeplite</a>, a startup based in Montreal, wants to change that by providing a way to reduce the overall size of the model, allowing it to run on hardware with far fewer resources.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $6 million seed investment. Boston-based venture capital firm PJC led the round with help from Innospark Ventures, Differential Ventures and Smart Global Holdings. Somel Investments, BDC Capital and Desjardins Capital also participated.</p>
<p>Nick Romano, CEO and co-founder at Deeplite, says that the company aims to take complex deep neural networks that require a lot of compute power to run, tend to use up a lot of memory, and can consume batteries at a rapid pace, and help them run more efficiently with fewer resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our platform can be used to transform those models into a new form factor to be able to deploy it into constrained hardware at the edge,&#8221; Romano explained. Those devices could be as small as a cell phone, a drone or even a Raspberry Pi, meaning that developers could deploy AI in ways that just wouldn&#8217;t be possible in most cases right now.</p>
<p>The company has created a product called Neutrino that lets you specify how you want to deploy your model and how much you can compress it to reduce the overall size and the resources required to run it in production. The idea is to run a machine learning application on an extremely small footprint.</p>
<p>Davis Sawyer, chief product officer and co-founder, says that the company&#8217;s solution comes into play after the model has been built, trained and is ready for production. Users supply the model and the data set and then they can decide how to build a smaller model. That could involve reducing the accuracy a bit if there is a tolerance for that, but chiefly it involves selecting a level of compression &#8212; how much smaller you can make the model.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compression reduces the size of the model so that you can deploy it on a much cheaper processor. We&#8217;re talking in some cases going from 200 megabytes down to on 11 megabytes or from 50 megabytes to 100 kilobytes,&#8221; Davis explained.</p>

<p>Rob May, who is leading the investment for PJC, says that he was impressed with the team and the technology the startup is trying to build.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deploying AI, particularly deep learning, on resource-constrained devices, is a broad challenge in the industry with scarce AI talent and know-how available. Deeplite’s automated software solution will create significant economic benefit as Edge AI continues to grow as a major computing paradigm,&#8221; May said in a statement.</p>
<p>The idea for the company has roots in the TandemLaunch incubator in Montreal. It launched officially as a company in mid-2019 and today has 15 employees with plans to double that by the end of this year. As it builds the company, Romano says the founders are focused on building a diverse and inclusive organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a strategy that&#8217;s going to find us the right people, but do it in a way that is absolutely diverse and inclusive. That&#8217;s all part of the DNA of the organization,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s possible to return to work, the plan is to have offices in Montreal and Toronto that act as hubs for employees, but there won&#8217;t be any requirement to come into the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already discussed that the general approach is going to be that people can come and go as they please, and we don&#8217;t think we will need as large an office footprint as we may have had in the past.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic forced everyone to stay at home last year, many gym-goers looked to at-home fitness makers to fill the void for their cardiovascular and strength-training workouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help meet that demand, <a href="https://tempo.fit/">Tempo</a>, the five-year-old fitness startup founded by Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin, closed a $220 million Series C round led by SoftBank. The company plans to use the raise to shore up its supply chain, keep up with increased consumer demand and fuel efforts such as R&amp;D and content. Other participants in the Series C round included Bling Capital, DCM, General Catalyst, Norwest Venture Partners and Steadfast Capital Ventures.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tempo’s freestanding cabinet, which the company launched in February 2020, includes a 42-inch touchscreen with a 3D motion-tracking camera that consistently scans, tracks and coaches users as they work out. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It currently sells three hardware bundles, starting at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2,495, that include accessories like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barbells, dumbbells, a folding bench, a kettlebell system, a squat rack, a workout mat, a recovery foam roller and a heart rate monitor, depending on which bundle customers spring for. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users also pay a $39 monthly subscription to access on-demand and live classes. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2137299,2137301,2137366,2137300,2137302,2137365"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept for Tempo came about in 2015 when Eldeeb and Augustin developed SmartSpot, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a computer vision-augmented smart screen they sold to gyms that helped trainers analyze and improve their clients’ form during workouts. With the trove of data generated and collected by SmartSpot, Eldeeb and Augustin developed a program that identified fitness users’ most common movement errors and utilized machine learning to offer unique recommendations for each individual user — a program that became part of the foundation for Tempo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a personal trainer once, I remember charging $150 an hour,” explains Eldeeb. “I want to create a better experience and offer it to many more people for a lot less. That means we&#8217;re going to continue to invest in the core technology that makes that possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tempo’s launch came during a particularly opportune time. With the pandemic unfolding, demand for at-home fitness solutions soared. The startup has seen sales surge 1,000% since it began taking pre-orders in early 2020, with delivery delays currently ranging between five to seven weeks — a common issue faced by other at-home fitness companies such as Peloton, Tonal and Echelon. Tempo users have collectively performed 5 million workouts, or clocked 40,000 hours on their devices to date, according to the company. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0NicenYFUg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">The Tonal EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Tonal EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/embed/#?secret=0NicenYFUg" data-secret="0NicenYFUg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That [supply chain] was definitely an issue,” acknowledges Eldeeb, pointing to production challenges posed by factories temporarily shutting down or reducing operations in 2020. “We were doing this for the first time at scale, and we’d made small quantities of the product before [launch]. But for our first year in the market, we had to solve all those problems and still ship the product, which was a huge undertaking. We basically had to reduce sales because I wanted the factory workers to be safe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tempo, the opportunity to scale is enormous, as the global market is estimated to reach </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/smart-fitness-devices-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$29.4 billion </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2025. With new funding in tow, Eldeeb wants to capitalize on surging demand, with plans of doubling down on logistics and its supply chain, growing employee headcount and expanding its content to offer yoga and boxing classes later this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With vaccinations across the U.S. steadily increasing and gyms reopening, the big question is whether people will stick with their at-home fitness workouts, throw themselves back into their old gym routines or adopt a hybrid model that marries the two. Eldeeb is betting that now that more people have acclimated to working out in their homes, they’ll stay the course out of sheer convenience, pointing to </span><a href="https://newconsumer.com/trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Consumer Trends report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from The New Consumer published earlier this year indicating that 81% of people under the age of 40 prefer to exercise at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If true, then companies like Tempo will continue to reap the benefits of this shift of fitness into the home. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you predict earnings when you are still figuring it out? You need to work on making your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable; and use tools that will help you create projections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a long time, &#8220;revenue&#8221; seemed to be a taboo word in the startup world. Fortunately, things have changed with the rise of SaaS and alternative funding sources such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/who-are-the-major-revenue-based-investing-vcs/">revenue-based investing VCs</a>. Still, revenue modeling remains a challenge for founders. How do you predict earnings when you are still figuring it out?</p>
<p>The answer is twofold: You need to make your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable in the first place, plus make use of tools that will help you create projections based on your data. Here, we&#8217;ll suggest some ways you can get more visibility into your revenue, find the data that really matter and figure out how to put a process in place to make forecasts about it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You need to make your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable in the first place, plus make use of tools that will help you create projections based on your data.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Base projections on repeatable, scalable results</h2>
<p>Aaron Ross is a co-author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213">&#8220;Predictable Revenue,&#8221;</a> a book based on his experience of creating a process and team that helped grow Salesforce&#8217;s revenue by more than $100 million. &#8220;Predictable&#8221; is the key word here: &#8220;You want growth that doesn&#8217;t require guessing, hope and frantic last-minute deal-hustling every quarter- and year-end,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This makes recurring revenue particularly desirable, though it is by no means the be-all-end-all of predictable revenue. On one hand, there is always the risk that recurring revenue won&#8217;t last, as customers may churn and organic growth runs out of gas. On the other, there is a broader picture for predictable revenue that goes beyond subscription-based models.</p>
<p>Ross and his co-author, <a href="https://maryloutyler.com/about/">Marylou Tyler,</a> outline three steps to predictable revenue: predictable lead generation, a dedicated sales development team and consistent sales systems. They wrote an entire book about it, so it would be hard to sum it up here. So what&#8217;s the takeaway? You shouldn&#8217;t base your projections on processes and results that aren&#8217;t repeatable and scalable.</p>
<h2>Cross the hot coals</h2>
<p>In their early days, startups usually grow via word of mouth, luck and sheer hustle. The problem is that it likely won&#8217;t lead to sustainable growth; as the saying goes, what got you <em>here</em> won&#8217;t get you <em>there</em>. In between, there is typically a phase of uncertainty and missed results that Ross refers to as &#8220;the hot coals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the hot coals, predicting revenue is vain at best, and oftentimes impossible. I, for one, remember being at a loss when an old-school investor asked me for five-year profit-and-loss projections when my now-defunct startup was nowhere near a stable money-making path. <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1029959027260764160?s=12">Not all seed investors expect this</a>, so there was obviously a mismatch here, but the challenge is still the same for most founders: How do you bridge the gap between traditional projections and the reality of a startup?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The $9 trillion financial management firm Blackrock is collaborating with the $313 billion Singapore investment firm Temasek to back companies developing technologies and services to help create a zero emission economy by 2050.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The two mega-investment firms will invest an initial $600 million to launch Decarbonization Partners, and look to raise money from investors committing to achieving a net zero world and long-term sustainable finacnial returns. The two partners have set themselves a goal to raise $1 billion for their first fund, including capital from Temasek and BlackRock.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership, coming during Earth month, is one of several big multi-billion dollar initiatives that are underway to prevent global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, BlackRock is somewhat tardy to the party. Temasek, for its part, has already made a number of high-profile bets in the alternative meat market &#8212; namely in companies like Impossible Foods &#8212; and in alternative energy technology developers including Eavor, a geothermal company, and a $500 million bet on a renewable power developer in India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a coalition of billionaires led by Bill Gates are already on their second billion dollar investment vehicle through Breakthrough Energy, a multi-stage, multi-strategy initiative that includes a venture capital arm as well as other types of financing on the way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The world cannot meet its net zero ambitions without transformational innovation,” said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, in a statement. “For decarbonization solutions and technologies to transform our economy, they need to be scaled. To do that, they need patient, well-managed capital to support their vital goals. This partnership will help define climate solutions as a standalone asset class that is both essential to our collective mission and a historic investment opportunity created by the net zero transition.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To get a sense of what Decarbonization Partners might back, companies should probably look to the Breakthrough Energy portfolio &#8212; the firms share similar interests in new sources of energy, technologies to distribute that energy, building and manufacturing technologies, and material science and process innovations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a big swing that the firms are taking, but the flood of capital coming into the sustainability sector is commensurate with both the size of the problem, and the potential opportunity in returns generated by solving it.</p>
<p>A report from Morgan Stanley estimated that solving climate change <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/10/24/stopping-global-warming-will-cost-50-trillion-morgan-stanley-report/?sh=4b3f1d7751e2">would be a $50 trillion problem</a>, according to a 2019 report from Forbes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Bold, aggressive actions are needed to make the global net zero ambition a reality. Decarbonization Partners represents one of several steps we are taking to follow through on our commitment to halve the emissions from our portfolio by 2030, and ultimately move to net zero emissions by 2050,” said Dilhan Pillay, Chief Executive Officer of Temasek International. “Through collective efforts with like-minded partners, we will be able to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders over the long term, and investors will have the opportunity to help deliver innovative solutions at scale to address climate challenges.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How much is Epic Games worth? Well, we’ve long ago surpasses the realm of dollar figures regular humans can contextualize. With its latest round, the gamer hits an equity valuation of $28.7 billion. Yes, &#8220;b&#8221; for &#8220;billion.&#8221; That’s a lot of micro-transactions.</p>
<p>Time to start talking metaverse!</p>
<p>Best known for the wildly successful battle royale title, Fortnite, Epic just announced another $1 billion funding round, featuring a $200 million Sony Group Corporation investment. The rest of the list is, predictably, a long one, including [deep breath], Appaloosa, Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, GIC, T. Rowe Price Associates-managed accounts, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, BlackRock managed accounts, Park West, KKR, AllianceBernstein, Altimeter, Franklin Templeton and Luxor Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“We are grateful to our new and existing investors who support our vision for Epic and the Metaverse,” CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a statement tied to the news. “Their investment will help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store.”</p>
<p>Sweeney has plenty of reason to be grateful, as the controlling shareholder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy several months for the game-maker. The company has been waging an on-going war with the both Apple and Google over in-game payment revenues. A trial expected to feature some of the biggest names in tech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/20/tim-cook-and-tim-sweeney-among-potential-witnesses-for-apple-epic-trial/">expected to kick off early next month</a>.</p>
<p>Epic has also been using its already extremely deep coffers to purchase game developers and publishing studios, including its March acquisition of Fall Guys-maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/epic-is-buying-fall-guys-developer-mediatonic/">Mediatonic</a>. It&#8217;s clear the company is amassing a large portfolio of titles through acquisitions, a trend that is almost certain to continue with this latest massive round.</p>
<p>The funding also looks likely to strengthen the company&#8217;s ties to Sony, as well. Here&#8217;s Sony Group Corporation CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, also quoted in the press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>Epic continues to deliver revolutionary experiences through their array of cutting edge technologies that support creators in gaming and across the digital entertainment industry. We are excited to strengthen our collaboration to bring new entertainment experiences to people around the world. I strongly believe that this aligns with our purpose to fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to this round, the company had <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2">raised $3.4 billion</a>, including a a $1.78 billion round last August.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justin Mast has a simple reason for starting his plant retail startup <a href="https://bloomscape.com/">Bloomscape</a> in Detroit.</p>
<p>“This is home,” he told me. “This is where I have a really strong network and I knew I’d be able to find a lot of support.”</p>
<p>Mast didn’t grow up in Detroit proper, but he’s from Grand Rapids, Michigan&#8217;s second largest city. He recalled a weekend in Detroit after finishing graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, when he was “totally blown away” by the city’s energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And when it came time to launch Bloomscape in 2018, Mast said it made sense to do so from Detroit because of Michigan’s “strong heritage in the horticulture industry” — in floriculture, for example, it <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/floran20.pdf">ranks as one of the biggest producers in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>That heritage isn’t abstract to him. Mast said his family has been involved in the industry for five generations on his father’s side (including three generations in the Netherlands) and three generations on his mother’s. He worked in the family greenhouse as a child and even starting a roadside plant stand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124397" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124397" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124397 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg" alt="Bloomscape" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bloomscape</p></div></p>
<p>“This was my version of a lemonade stand,” he said — albeit a lemonade stand that became popular enough that Mast needed to recruit his siblings for help, and that eventually provided him with enough money to buy a used car.</p>
<p>Bloomscape launched in 2018, and Mast said that from the beginning, the startup’s advantage was “to really know the ins and outs of the business.” That allowed Bloomscape to ship larger plants (like birds of paradise and Chinese fan palms), and more recently to expand with outdoor plants and garden <a href="https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/">&#8220;bloom kits.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>“By focusing on one of the least glamorized parts of this industry, the supply chain, we are able to design this process for shipping larger plants, at scale, throughout the country,” he said. “We’re shipping out tropical plants in the dead of winter, thousands of times a week, with a real high level of consistency. We know the plants really well, we how they perform, how they move through a supply chain, we know the nuances of FedEx and UPS, we know what growers are growing quality product.”</p>
<p>Bloomscape has raised a total of $24 million, most recently in a Series B last fall led by General Catalyst, with participation from Annox Capital’s Bob Mylod, Home Depot board member Jeff Boyd, former Seventh Generation and Burt’s Bees CEO John Replogle and existing investors Revolution Ventures and Ludlow Ventures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124400" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124400" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2124400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bloomscape.gif?w=600" alt="Bloomscape" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124400" class="wp-caption-text">Bloomscape bloom kits</p></div></p>
<p>When I asked whether investors had ever pressured him to move the startup to Silicon Valley, Mast said, “We’ve had successful funding rounds, but even in most successful rounds, not everyone’s going to be the right fit.” So it sounds like the issue came up, but Mast made sure that everyone who actually invested saw the startup’s location as an advantage, or at least “if they saw it as a disadvantage, they were willing to overlook it.”</p>

<p>Nor has the location proven to be an issue when it comes to hiring. Mast said the company successfully lured Aaron Averbuch (formerly based in Seattle and a vice president of engineering at Placed and Snap) to Detroit to become CTO. He also noted that Detroit is close to the University of Michigan, and that “all the schools in Chicago and Pittsburgh are within a few hours’ drive.”</p>
<p>Mast added that the last six months have been “a particularly exciting time” to run a startup in Detroit, with the success of companies like StockX, Floyd and Autobooks.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re thrilled to be here,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.homex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a home services platform for homeowners and service providers</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised $90 million in a funding round led by New Mountain Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mountain Capital, a New York-based investment firm with more than $30 billion in assets under management, was the only institutional investor to put money in this round alongside company executives. The company was bootstrapped until a 2019 $50 million-plus debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, Chicago-based HomeX aims to “radically improve” home services by pairing service workers with homeowners, both virtually and in person. It also has built software, and offers services for, contractors that are aimed at helping them drive and manage demand “more efficiently.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, one of the company’s co-founders, CTO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjweaver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Weaver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and several team members were on the development team of Evi, a startup that had built an AI program that can be communicated with using natural language via an app, that was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/sources-say-amazon-acquired-siri-like-evi-app-for-26m-is-a-smartphone-coming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012. That technology was essentially the brain behind Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX uses artificial intelligence to diagnose home issues virtually before a contractor even goes out to a home, with the goal of helping them resolve a problem faster (by having the necessary equipment ahead of time for example), which in turn makes customers happier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re using machine-generated content to create solutions that are specific to a homeowner’s issues,” said  co-founder and president Vincent Payen. “Using machines to understand symptoms, the questions to ask and to actually get to a diagnosis and a recommendation or resolution is where AI absolutely shines and allows us to do things that were not possible even three or five years ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and CEO Michael Werner worked in the </span><a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/research/home-services-is-a-500-billion-dollar-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$500 billion services industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years (his family founded <a href="https://www.wernerco.com/us">Werner Ladders</a>) and recognized just how fragmented it was. He also acknowledges that, especially in certain markets, “there&#8217;s a terrible imbalance between very high demand and not enough contractors to do the work, or rather, a terrible labor shortage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX Remote Assist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular virtually connects homeowners (via phone, video or chat) with HomeX’s licensed technicians to diagnose and repair common home issues. That business unit has experienced more than 400% growth in less than a year, according to Werner. Last year, the company grew by “about 5x” the number of contractors on its platform. It declined to reveal revenue figures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For homeowners, we&#8217;re making home maintenance less complicated,” Werner said. “At the same time, we want to help the contractor succeed. Similar to how telemedicine has changed how medicine is delivered, HomeX Remote Assist is going to change the service experience for taking care of your home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area of HomeX’s business that is growing rapidly is its B2B offering. Home warranty and insurance companies see remote services “as very additive to make their business more efficient,” notes Payen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using some of our capital toward a pilot program and a number of business development opportunities there,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, while the company is not profitable overall, it is profitable in the services side of its business, according to Werner. In the last 12 months alone, it has served &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of clients via its platform, defined by unique virtual and physical appointments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mountain Capital Managing Director Harris Kealey said his firm viewed HomeX as a business that is primed to reshape the home and commercial services industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market is massive and the need for change and innovation is substantial,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p>Another company in the space, <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com">Thumbtack</a>, recently expanded into video home checkups. Thumbtack, a marketplace where you can hire local professionals for home improvement and other services such as repairs, in December <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/thumbtack-acquires-setter/">acquired</a> <a href="https://setter.com">Setter, </a>a startup which provided its customers with video home checkups conducted by experts, and then offered personalized plans for how to address any issues.</p>
<p>Thumbtack had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/thumbtack-layoffs/">laid off 250 employees</a> at the end of March 2020, after the company saw big declines in its major markets. Since then, however, CEO Marco Zappacosta told TechCrunch there’s been “a renewed focus on the home and an acceleration of digital adoption.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence technology holds a huge amount of promise for enterprises &#8212; as a tool to process and understand their data more efficiently; as a way to leapfrog into new kinds of services and products; and as a critical stepping stone into whatever the future might hold for their businesses. But the problem for many enterprises is that they are not tech businesses at their cores and so bringing on and using AI will typically involve a lot of heavy lifting. Today, one of the startups building AI services is announcing a big round of funding to help bridge that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sambanova.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SambaNova</a> &#8212; a startup building AI hardware and integrated systems that run on it that only officially came out of three years in stealth last December &#8212; is announcing a huge round of funding today to take its business out into the world. The company has closed in on $676 million in financing, a Series D that co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Liang has confirmed values the company at $5.1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by SoftBank, which is making the investment via Vision Fund 2. Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. (GIC), both new investors, are also participating, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/the-red-hot-ai-chip-space-gets-even-hotter-with-56m-for-a-startup-called-sambanova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous backers</a> BlackRock, Intel Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Walden International and WRVI, among other unnamed investors. (Sidenote: BlackRock and Temasek separately <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005969/en/Temasek-and-BlackRock-Launch-Decarbonization-Investment-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off an investment partnership yesterday</a>, although it&#8217;s not clear if this falls into that remit.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founded by two Stanford professors, Kunle Olukotun and Chris Ré, and Liang, who had been an engineering executive at Oracle, SambaNova has been around since 2017 and has raised more than $1 billion to date &#8212; both to build out its AI-focused hardware, which it calls <a href="https://sambanova.ai/products/datascale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataScale</a> and to build out the system that runs on it. (The &#8220;Samba&#8221; in the name is a reference to Liang&#8217;s Brazilian heritage, he said, but also the Latino music and dance that speaks of constant movement and shifting, not unlike the journey AI data regularly needs to take that makes it too complicated and too intensive to run on more traditional systems.)</p>
<p>SambaNova on one level competes for enterprise business against companies like Nvidia, Cerebras Systems and Graphcore &#8212; another startup in the space which earlier this year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/ai-chipmaker-graphcore-raises-222m-at-a-2-77b-valuation-and-puts-an-ipo-in-its-sights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a significant round</a>. However, SambaNova has also taken a slightly different approach to the AI challenge.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201209005200/en/SambaNova-Systems-Ushers-in-New-Era-of-Computing-with-Availability-of-SambaNova-DataScale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a>, the startup launched <a href="https://sambanova.ai/services/dataflow-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataflow-as-a-service</a> as an on-demand, subscription-based way for enterprises to tap into SambaNova&#8217;s AI system, with the focus just on the applications that run on it, without needing to focus on maintaining those systems themselves. It&#8217;s the latter that SambaNova will be focusing on selling and delivering with this latest tranche of funding, Liang said.</p>
<p>SambaNova&#8217;s opportunity, Liang believes, lies in selling software-based AI systems to enterprises that are keen to adopt more AI into their business, but might lack the talent and other resources to do so if it requires running and maintaining large systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market right now has a lot of interest in AI. They are finding they have to transition to this way of competing, and it&#8217;s no longer acceptable not to be considering it,&#8221; said Liang in an interview.</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that most AI companies &#8220;want to talk chips,&#8221; yet many would-be customers will lack the teams and appetite to essentially become technology companies to run those services. &#8220;Rather than you coming in and thinking about how to hire scientists and hire and then deploy an AI service, you can now subscribe, and bring in that technology overnight. We’re very proud that our technology is pushing the envelope on cases in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, a company will <em>still</em> need data scientists, just not the same number, and specifically not the same number dedicating their time to maintaining systems, updating code and other more incremental work that comes managing an end-to-end process.</p>
<p>SambaNova has not disclosed many customers so far in the work that it has done &#8212; the two reference names it provided to me are both research labs, the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sambanova.ai/videos/argonne-national-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sambanova.ai/videos/argonne-national-laboratory/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618405040273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkKuXMEiUeVRaxOsAQsDQ8dddoMA">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sambanova.ai/videos/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sambanova.ai/videos/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618405040273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBSo0lMOUlA0ytBQaWCC6OxPxHMw">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> &#8212; but Liang noted some typical use cases.</p>
<p>One was in imaging, such as in the healthcare industry, where the company&#8217;s technology is being used to help train systems based on high-resolution imagery, along with other healthcare-related work. The coincidentally-named Corona supercomputer at the Livermore Lab (it was named after the 2014 lunar eclipse, not the dark cloud of a pandemic that we&#8217;re currently living through) is using SambaNova&#8217;s technology to help run calculations related to some Covid-19 therapeutic and antiviral compound research, Marshall Choy, the company&#8217;s VP of product, told me.</p>
<p>Another set of applications involves building systems around custom language models, for example in specific industries like finance, to process data quicker. And a third is in recommendation algorithms, something that appears in most digital services and frankly could always do to work a little better than it does today. I&#8217;m guessing that in the coming months it will release more information about where and who is using its technology.</p>
<p>Liang also would not comment on whether Google and Intel were specifically tapping SambaNova as a partner in their own AI services, but he didn&#8217;t rule out the prospect of partnering to go to market. Indeed, both have strong enterprise businesses that span well beyond technology companies, and so working with a third party that is helping to make even their own AI cores more accessible could be an interesting prospect, and SambaNova&#8217;s DataScale (and the Dataflow-as-a-service system) both work using input from frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, so there is a level of integration already there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re quite comfortable in collaborating with others in this space,&#8221; Liang said. &#8220;We think the market will be large and will start segmenting. The opportunity for us is in being able to take hold of some of the hardest problems in a much simpler way on their behalf. That is a very valuable proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The promise of creating a more accessible AI for businesses is one that has eluded quite a few companies to date, so the prospect of finally cracking that nut is one that appeals to investors.</p>
<p>“SambaNova has created a leading systems architecture that is flexible, efficient and scalable. This provides a holistic software and hardware solution for customers and alleviates the additional complexity driven by single technology component solutions,” said Deep Nishar, Senior Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Rodrigo and the SambaNova team to support their mission of bringing advanced AI solutions to organizations globally.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Building, scaling and launching new tools and products is the lifeblood of the technology sector. When we consider these concepts today, many think of Big Tech and flashy startups, known for their industry dominance or new technologies that impact our everyday lives. But long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for these innovations, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for innovation, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As an industry, we’ve developed a notion that working in government, the place where the groundwork was laid for<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/personalized-assistant-that-learns"> the digital assistants we use every day</a>, is now far less appealing than working in the private sector. The immense salary differential is often cited as the overwhelming reason workers prefer to work in the private sphere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the hard truth is the private sector brings far more value than just higher compensation to employees. Look no further than the boom in the tech sector during the pandemic to understand why it’s so attractive. A company like Zoom, already established and successful in its own right for years, found itself in a situation where it had to<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"> serve an exponentially growing and diverse user base</a> in a short period of time. It quickly confronted a slew of infrastructure and user experience pivots on its way to becoming a staple of work-from-home culture &#8212; and succeeded.</p>
<p>That innate ability to work fast to deliver for consumers and innovate at what feels like a moment’s notice is what really draws talent. Compare that to the government’s tech environment, where decreased funding and partisan oversight slow the pace of work, or, worse, can get in the way of exploring or implementing new ideas entirely.</p>
<p>One look (literally, see our graph below) at the trends around R&amp;D spending in the private and government sectors also paints a clear picture of where future innovations will come from if we don’t change the equation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133385" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133385" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2133385 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?w=680" alt="Chart of Facebook R&amp;D spending vs. DARPA annual budget" width="680" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133385" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Josh Mendelsohn/Hangar</p></div></p>
<p>Look no further than the U.S. government’s own (now defunct) Office of Technology Assessment. The agency aimed to provide a thorough analysis of burgeoning issues in science and technology, exposing many public services to a new age of innovation and implementation. Amid a period of downsizing by a newly Republican-led Congress, the OTA was defunded in 1995 with a peak annual budget of just $35.1 million (adjusted for 2019 dollars). The authoritative body on the importance of technology to the government was deemed duplicative and unnecessary. Despite<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/12/18/congress-should-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment-heres-how-to-do-it/"> numerous calls for its reinstatement</a>, it has since remained shuttered.</p>
<p>Despite dwindling public sector investment and lackluster political action, the problems that technology is poised to help solve haven’t gone away or even eased up.</p>
<p>From the COVID pandemic to worsening natural disasters and growing societal inequities, public leaders have a responsibility to solve the pressing issues we face today. That responsibility should breed a desire to continuously iterate for the sake of constituents and quality of life, much in the same way private tech caters to the product, user and bottom line.</p>
<p>My own experiences in government have shaped my career and approach to building new technologies more than my time in Silicon Valley. There are plenty of tangible parallels to the private sector that can attract driven and passionate tech workers, but the responsibility of giving government work realistic consideration doesn’t just fall at the feet of talent. The governments that we depend on must invest more capital and pay closer attention to the tech community.</p>
<p>Tech workers want an environment where they can thrive and get to see their work in action, whoever the end user may be. They don’t want to feel hamstrung by the<a href="https://time.com/longform/america-innovation/"> threat of decreased funding</a> or the red tape that comes as a result of government partisanship. Replicating the unimpeded focus of Silicon Valley’s brightest examples is a must if we’re serious about drawing talented individuals into government or public-sector-focused work.</p>
<p>A great example of these ideas in action is one of the most beloved government agencies, NASA. Its continued funding has produced technologies developed for space exploration that are now<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/08/space-race-inventions-we-use-every-day-were-created-for-space-exploration/39580591/"> commonplace</a> in our lives, such as scratch-resistant lenses, memory foam and water filters. These use cases came much later on, only after millions of dollars were invested without knowing what would result.</p>
<p>NASA has continued to bolster its ability to stay nimble and evolve at a rapid pace by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/30/how-nasa-is-evolving-through-partnerships-with-private-space-companies.html"> partnering with private companies</a>. For talent in the tech sphere, the ability to leverage outside resources in this way, without compromising the product or work, is a boon for ideation and iteration.</p>
<p>One can also point to the agency when considering the importance of keeping technology research and innovation as apolitical as possible. It’s one of the few widely known public entities to prosper on the back of<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-nasa-authorization-bill-clears-senate"> bipartisan support</a>. Unfortunately, politicians typically do all of us a disservice, particularly tech workers in government, when they too closely connect themselves or their parties to a particular program or platform. It hinders innovation &#8212; and the ensuing mudslinging can detract from talented individuals jumping into government service.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of extremely capable tech workers who want to help solve the biggest issues facing society. Will we give them the legitimate space and opportunity to conquer those problems? There’s been some indication that we can. These ambitious and forward-looking efforts matter today more than ever and show all of us in the tech ecosystem that there’s a place in government for tech talent to grow and flourish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://consensys.net/">ConsenSys</a>, a key player in crypto and a major proponent of the Ethereum blockchain, has raised a $65 million funding round from J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and UBS AG, as well as major blockchain companies Protocol Labs, the Maker Foundation, Fenbushi, The LAO and Alameda Research. Additional investors include CMT Digital and the Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund. As well as fiat, several funds invested with Ethereum-based stablecoins, DAI and USDC, as consideration.</p>
<p>Sources told TechCrunch that this is an unpriced round because of the valuation risk, and the funding instrument is “full”, so the round is being closed now.</p>
<p>The fundraise looks like a highly strategic one, based around the idea that traditional institutions will need visibility into the increasingly influential world of ‘decentralized finance’ (DeFi) and the Web3 applications being developed on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement on the fundraise, ConsenSys said it has been through a “period of strategic evolution and growth”, but most outside observers would agree that this is that’s something of an understatement.</p>
<p>After a period of quite a lot of ‘creative disruption’ to put it mildly (at one point a couple of years ago, ConsenSys seemed to have everything from a VC fund, to an accelerator, to multiple startups under its wing), the company has restructured to form two main arms: ConsenSys, the core software business; and ConsenSys Mesh, the investment arm, incubator, and portfolio. It also acquired the Quorum product from J.P. Morgan which has given it a deeper bench into the enterprise blockchain ecosystem. This means it now has a very key product suite for the Etherum platform, including products such as Codefi, Diligence, Infura, MetaMask, Truffle, and Quorum.</p>
<p>This suite allows it to serve both public and private permissioned blockchain networks. It can also support Layer 2 Ethereum networks, as well as facilitate access to adjacent protocols like IPFS, Filecoin, and others. ConsenSys is also a major contributor to the Ethereum 2.0 project, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fundraise, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and co-founder, Ethreum said in a statement: “When we set out to raise a round, it was important to us to patiently construct a diverse cap table, consistent with our belief that similar to how the web developed, the whole economy would join the revolutionaries on a next-generation protocol. ConsenSys’ software stack represents access to a new automated objective trust foundation enabled by decentralized protocols like Ethereum. We are proud to partner with preeminent financial firms alongside leading crypto companies to further converge the centralized and decentralized financial domains at this particularly exciting time of growth for ConsenSys and the entire industry.”</p>
<p>With financial institutions able to see, ‘in public’ DeFi happening on Ethereuem, because of the public chain, they can see how much of the financial system is gradually starting to merge with the blockchain world. So it&#8217;s becoming clearer what attracts these major institutions.</p>
<p>Mike Dargan, Head of Group Technology at UBS said: “Our investment in ConsenSys adds proven expertise in distributed ledger technology to our UBS Next portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>For MasterCard this appears to be not just a pure investment &#8211; Consensys has been working with it on a private permissioned network.</p>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships at Mastercard said: “Enterprise Ethereum is a key infrastructure on which we and our partners are building payment and non-payment applications to power the future of commerce… Our investment and partnership with ConsenSys helps us bring secure and performant Enterprise Ethereum capabilities to our customers.”</p>
<p>Colleen Sullivan, Co-Founder and CEO of CMT Digital said: “ConsenSys is the pioneer in bridging the gaps across traditional finance, centralized crypto, and DeFi, and more broadly, between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. We are proud to participate in this funding round as the ConsenSys team continues to pave the way for global users  — retail and institutional — to easily access the crypto ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands that the fundraise was started around the time of the Quorum acquisition, last June. The $65 million round is in majority fiat currency as opposed to cryptocurrency and is an adjunct to the round done with JP Morgan last summer.</p>
<p>The presence of significant crypto players such as Maker Protocol Labs shows the significance of the fund-raise, beyond the simple transaction.  The announcement also comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO, which makes for interesting timing.</p>
<p>ConsenSys’ products have become highly significant in the world where developers, enterprises, and consumers meet blockchain and crypto. In its statement, the company claims MetaMask now has over three million monthly active users across mobile and desktop, a 3x increase in the last five or six months, it says. This is roughly the same amount of monthly active customers as Coinbase.</p>
<p>The ConsenSys announcement comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO. While Coinbase is acting as an exchange to turn fiat into crypto and vice versa, it has also been getting into DeFi of late. Where there are also resemblances with ConsenSys, is that Coinbase, with 3 million users, is used as a wallet, and MetMask, which also has 3 million users, can also be used as a wallet. The comparison ends there, but it’s certainly interesting, given Coinbase’s $100 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As Jeremy Millar, Chief Development Officer, told me: “Coinbase has pioneered an exchange, in one of the world&#8217;s most regulated financial markets, the US. And it has helped drive significant interest in the space.  We enjoy a very positive relationship with Coinbase, trying to further enable the ecosystem and adoption of the technology.”</p>
<p>The background to this raise is that a lot of early-stage blockchain and crypto companies have been raising a lot of money recently, but much of this has been through crypto investment firms. Only a handful of Silicon Valley VCs are backing blockchain, such as Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this announcement is that these incumbent financial giants are not only taking an interest, but working alongside ConsenSys to both invest and build products on Ethereum.</p>
<p>It’s ConsenSys’ view that every payment service provider, banks will need this financial infrastructure in the  future, especially for DeFI.</p>
<p>Given there is roughly $43 billion collateralized in DeFi, it&#8217;s increasingly the case that major investors are involved, and there are increasingly higher returns than traditional yield and bond or bond yields.</p>
<p>The moves by Central Banks into digital currencies is also forcing companies and governments to realize digital currency, and the ‘blockchain rails’ on which it runs, is here to stay. This is what is suggested by the Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund’s (a Shenzhen / Hong Kong joint partnership) decision to get involved.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this story is that ConsenSys is sitting on some extremely powerful products. Consensys has six products that serve three different types of people.</p>
<p>Service developers who are building on Ethereum are using Truffle to develop smart contracts. Users joining the NFT hype are using MetaMask underneath it all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oWAC94df6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/">ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/embed/#?secret=oWAC94df6j" data-secret="oWAC94df6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The MetaMask wallet allows users to swap one token for another. This has proved quite lucrative for ConsenSys, which says it has resulted in  $1.8 billion in volume in decentralized exchange use. ConsenSys takes a 0.875 percent cut on every swap that it serves.</p>
<p>And institutions are using Consensys’ products. The company says more than 150,000 developers use Infura’s APIs, and 4.5 million developers create and deploy smart contracts using Truffle, while its Protocols group — developer of Hyperledger Besu and ConsenSys Quorum — are building Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for six central banks, says Consensys.</p>
<p>Consensys is also making hay with the NFT boom. Developers are using Consensys products for the nodes and infrastructure on Ethereum which stores the NFT files.</p>
<p>Consensys is also riding two waves. One is the developer eave and the other is the financial system wave.</p>
<p>As a spokesperson said: “Where the interest in money and invention started happening was on public networks like Ethereum. So we really believe that these are converging and they will continue to, and every one of our products offers public main net compatibility because we think this is the future.”</p>
<p>Millar added: “If we want to help the world adopt the technology we need to meet it at its adoption point, which for many large enterprises means inside the firewall first. But similarly, we think, just like the public Internet, the real value &#8211;  the disruptive value &#8211; changes the ability to do this on a broader permissionless basis, especially when you have sufficient privacy and authentication available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning officially <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-13/spotify-launches-our-newest-exploration-a-limited-release-of-car-thing-a-smart-player-for-your-car/">announced</a> the limited U.S. release of its first hardware device, the oddly named <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a>, aimed at Spotify Premium subscribers. The new device &#8212; which Spotify is surprisingly offering for free plus shipping &#8212; has evolved substantially from the version <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">that first began testing in 2019</a>. This upgraded model has a touchscreen, a big, grippable knob for navigation, voice control features, and four preset buttons at the top for favorite music, podcasts or playlists, similar to Spotify on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The company explained its interest in Car Thing is about solving a need for customers who want a &#8220;more seamless&#8221; and personalized in-car listening experience. Although many cars today support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, Spotify points out that the average age of a car in the U.S. is actually 11 years old and the average lifetime of cars is 18 years. That means there are still a large number of cars on the road that don&#8217;t support modern, in-car infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Car Thing is being introduced to serve this market &#8212; and likely, to give Spotify the opportunity to explore future business models where it has a more direct relationship with customers inside the vehicle, though the company isn&#8217;t speaking to its longer-term ambitions at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The new Car Thing itself is a lightweight (3.4 oz.), thin (4.6&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 0.7&#8243;) music and podcast player that offers a combination of voice control, knobs, buttons, and a touchscreen display for navigating its menus and selecting the media you want to hear. You can choose to use set up the device to work via Bluetooth or an AUX or USB cable, depending on how you usually connect your phone to your car stereo to play music.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also able to mount Car Thing to your dash in a variety of ways as the device ships with three different types of dash and vent mounts to choose from, along with a car charger and USB-C cable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137352" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137352" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png 3708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=1536,1084 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=2048,1445 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Car Thing will walk you through a quick tour where it explains how to get started. The user interface recalls the Spotify mobile app, so it isn&#8217;t difficult to get used to for first-time users. Here, you can tap, swipe and use your voice to interact with the screen. The knob lets you quickly move through your choices &#8212; an experience that may be more comfortable to those used to interacting with knobs on their car&#8217;s built-in stereo.</p>
<p>Across the top of the device are four preset buttons that let you save your favorite content for easy access. By default, these are configured with your Liked Songs and Spotify&#8217;s Daily Drive and Morning Commute playlists, with the last preset empty. Many users may just keep these selections, but you can change them at any time, Spotify says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137347" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137347" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png 3708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=768,360 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=1536,720 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=2048,960 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137347" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Ahead of the device&#8217;s launch, Spotify quietly began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/spotify-stays-quiet-about-launch-of-its-voice-command-hey-spotify-on-mobile/">rolling out support for its &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command</a>, which Car Thing leverages, too. This lets you speak your requests directly to Spotify, by asking for a song, album, artist, playlist, station or podcast, which Car Thing &#8220;hears&#8221; by way of its four microphones at the top. (Four, because Spotify wants Car Thing to respond even if you&#8217;re blasting your music or have the windows down, which creates additional noise.)</p>
<p>On mobile devices, using &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; is an opt-in option that you can shut off from the app&#8217;s settings. But Car Thing represents a smarter, not to mention more safety-focused, use case for voice control. Instead of fiddling with the screen or knobs, you can speak your commands &#8212; or allow your kids to shout out their options from the backseat, perhaps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137357" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137357" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137357" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png" alt="" width="1024" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=1536,586 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137357" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/"> policy regarding its use of voice data</a> explains the company will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you, and may use the data to improve the feature over time. The company told us that beyond the voice data, the device isn&#8217;t collecting any more information that it does already in the mobile app. Still, Car Thing does give Spotify a more direct window into what people listen to during commutes and longer road trips, which could inform its future products, programmed playlists and other features.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a typical year, Americans spend over 70 billion hours in their cars and there are 250 million cars on America&#8217;s roads today,&#8221; noted Spotify&#8217;s Head of Global Culture and Trends, Shanon Cook. &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of time spent on the road. So what you do and what you listen to, to help you get through those hours in the car really matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Car Thing is being made available during this limited release period for free, as selected users will just pay the cost of shipping &#8212; a choice Spotify made because Car Thing is still somewhat experimental.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Spotify&#8217;s first hardware, and we obviously want to get things right,&#8221; said Spotify&#8217;s Head of Hardware Products, Andreas Cedborg. &#8220;And we want to learn quite a lot here in the beginning, so it&#8217;s a natural way for us to start,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg 11944w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1331 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify says the current retail price for the device is $80. It doesn&#8217;t know if or when it will begin to retail the device, however. But it can roll out updates to its software so at least the device won&#8217;t be immediately obsolete, if Spotify decides to go in a different direction one day.</p>
<p>Despite Spotify&#8217;s exploration into hardware, the company stressed it doesn&#8217;t aim to be a hardware company. If anything, it&#8217;s seems more likely that Spotify is toying with the idea of becoming the next SiriusXM by way of a specialized in-car experience &#8212; although one that&#8217;s even more of an add-on than SiriusXM is as you physically have to attach the thing &#8212; the Car Thing &#8212; to your dash. Longer-term, it&#8217;s not clear it makes much sense to develop a Car Thing product line as cars get smarter every year and infotainment systems become more standard.</p>
<p>Car Thing will only be offered on an invite-only basis via <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">carthing.spotify.com</a> to U.S. Spotify Premium subscribers with a smartphone. The company declined to say how many units would be shipped, so you&#8217;ll probably want to jump on the waitlist sooner rather than later if such a device interests you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are you 100% sure that your children are brushing their teeth properly? A New York-based startup called <a href="https://www.willo.com">Willo</a> has been working for several years on a device that should transform the tooth-brushing experience for children.</p>
<p>Willo isn’t a new toothbrush — electric or not. It’s an oral care device that doesn’t look like a toothbrush at all. The startup has worked with dental professionals to start from scratch with oral care in mind.</p>
<p>The device can be quite intimidating when you don’t see it in action as it takes quite a bit of shelf space and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do. But when you see it in action, it looks easier than expected. Willo specifically targets children because they tend to struggle to reach every tooth and brush properly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQGJAOzQVJo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Kids are supposed to grab the handle and put the mouthpiece in their mouth. They can start brushing by pressing the button and that’s it. They don’t have to do anything else. The silicone-based mouthpiece also features soft bristles. It starts vibrating in your kid’s mouth when they press the button.</p>
<p>The handle is connected to a bigger home station that contains a water tank with a special rinse liquid. Kids don’t have to use toothpaste and don’t have to rinse their mouth. Everything is handled by the device.</p>
<p>Finally, Willo is a connected device, which means that parents can track oral care in a mobile app. You can also set up multiple users — your kids will have to swap the mouthpiece before using the device.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about buying a device for your children, Willo costs $199. You then have to pay $13 per month to receive rinse pods as well as new mouthpieces that always fit.</p>
<p>While the product is going live today, the startup has already tested it with real families. These children rated the device 4.73/5 and parents gave an NPS of 70+. They’ve all kept using Willo after the testing phase.</p>
<p>Behind this product, there’s a team of 33 people in France and the U.S. They have filed over 50 patents over the past 7 years — 30 of them have been granted so far. The company has raised $17 million in total funding from Kleiner Perkins, Bpifrance and Matt Rogers’ fund Incite.</p>
<p>It’s true that the concept of a toothbrush hasn’t changed at all. Making a device that changes the way you brush your teeth is an ambitious bet. But it’s clear that the startup has made a lot of efforts to tackle this challenge. Now let’s see if they manage to convince parents.</p>
