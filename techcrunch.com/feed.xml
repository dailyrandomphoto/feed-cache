</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investors in AI-first technology companies serving the defense industry, such as Palantir, Primer and Anduril, are doing well. Anduril, for one, reached a valuation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/anduril-funding-series-d-valuation/">over $4 billion in less than four years</a>. Many other companies that build general-purpose, AI-first technologies — such as image labeling — receive large (undisclosed) portions of their revenue from the defense industry.</p>
<p>Investors in AI-first technology companies that aren’t even intended to serve the defense industry often find that these firms eventually (and sometimes inadvertently) help other powerful institutions, such as police forces, municipal agencies and media companies, prosecute their duties.</p>
<p>Most do a lot of good work, such as <a href="https://www.datarobot.com/covid/">DataRobot helping agencies understand</a> the spread of COVID, <a href="https://hash.ai/blog/vaccine-distribution-scenario-modeling">HASH running simulations</a> of vaccine distribution or <a href="https://lilt.com/press">Lilt</a> making school communications available to immigrant parents in a U.S. school district.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The first step in taking responsibility is knowing what on earth is going on. It&#8217;s easy for startup investors to shrug off the need to know what’s going on inside AI-based models.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, there are also some less positive examples — technology made by Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">used to hack 37 smartphones</a> belonging to journalists, human-rights activists, business executives and the fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a report by The Washington Post and 16 media partners. The report claims the phones were on a list of over 50,000 numbers based in countries that surveil their citizens and are known to have hired the services of the Israeli firm.</p>
<p>Investors in these companies may now be asked challenging questions by other founders, limited partners and governments about whether the technology is too powerful, enables too much or is applied too broadly. These are questions of degree, but are sometimes not even asked upon making an investment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of talking to a lot of people with lots of perspectives — CEOs of big companies, founders of (currently!) small companies and politicians — since publishing <a href="http://theaifirstcompany.com">&#8220;The AI-First Company&#8221;</a> and investing in such firms for the better part of a decade. I&#8217;ve been getting one important question over and over again: How do investors ensure that the startups in which they invest responsibly apply AI?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be frank: It&#8217;s easy for startup investors to hand-wave away such an important question by saying something like, &#8220;It&#8217;s so hard to tell when we invest.” Startups are nascent forms of something to come. However, AI-first startups are working with something powerful from day one: Tools that allow leverage far beyond our physical, intellectual and temporal reach.</p>
<p>AI not only gives people the ability to put their hands around heavier objects (robots) or get their heads around more data (analytics), it also gives them the ability to bend their minds around time (predictions). When people can make predictions and learn as they play out, they can learn fast. When people can learn fast, they can act fast.</p>
<p>Like any tool, one can use these tools for good or for bad. You can use a rock to build a house or you can throw it at someone. You can use gunpowder for beautiful fireworks or firing bullets.</p>
<p>Substantially similar, AI-based computer vision models can be used to figure out the moves of a dance group or a terrorist group. AI-powered drones can aim a camera at us while going off ski jumps, but they can also aim a gun at us.</p>
<p>This article covers the basics, metrics and politics of responsibly investing in AI-first companies.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>Investors in and board members of AI-first companies must take at least partial responsibility for the decisions of the companies in which they invest.</p>
<p>Investors influence founders, whether they intend to or not. Founders constantly ask investors about what products to build, which customers to approach and which deals to execute. They do this to learn and improve their chances of winning. They also do this, in part, to keep investors engaged and informed because they may be a valuable source of capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/">Reach Capital,</a> a San Francisco-based venture firm co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jencarolan">Jennifer Carolan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SLP_EDU">Shauntel Garvey</a>, focused exclusively on edtech for years before the sector ballooned with unicorns. The rare, female-led partnership closed its third fund in February, a $165 million vehicle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/reach-capital-fund-3/">and its largest to date.</a> That said, returns from its previous funds show that the early bet on a now-revitalized sector is paying off.</p>
<p>Reach Capital’s second fund, an $82 million vehicle closed in 2017, posted a net internal return rate of 72.1% as of Q2 2021, according to data intended for LPs and obtained by TechCrunch. The fund, which put investments into Paper, Winnie and now-unicorns Handshake and Outschool, ranks multiple percentage points above the top quartile of funds of that vintage. According to Cambridge Associates data, the top quartile of funds of that vintage had a net IRR of 47.64% the same quarter.</p>
<p>By comparison, Reach Capital’s first fund was multiple percentage points below the top quartile of fund performers of its vintage year, 2015.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Reach Capital’s returns for its second fund are mostly paper gains, meaning that the net IRR is based on an uptick in valuations. Given the fact that the firm is heavily concentrated in follow-on rounds, the IRR is thus a snapshot of a single moment of its performance in time. Reach recently had its first cash exit, seeing portfolio company <a href="https://ellevationeducation.com/news/ellevation-merges-curriculum-associates">Ellevation</a> merge with Curriculum Associates, but that is not represented in the data.</p>
<p>A number of blooming startups may explain what’s driving the improved performance between Reach I and Reach II. Per an impact report, Reach II invested $32 million into 14 core investments, including Newsela, Handshake and Outschool, all companies that have now gone to pass the billion-dollar valuation mark, making them unicorns. It also put money into Paper, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paper-series-c-ivp/">recently landed a nine-figure round led by IVP</a>. By getting into those companies early, and then watching them get marked up as edtech booms as a category, Reach’s positions get validated.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4Azdp3jo5O"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Outschool is the newest edtech unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/embed/#?secret=4Azdp3jo5O" data-secret="4Azdp3jo5O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://reachcapital.com/impact/#/how-invest">The diversity of Reach II’s portfolio</a> beats industry averages, but the founders are still concentrated as white and male. About 74% of investments are founded by men, while 26% are founded by women, the report states. About 62% of founders identify as white, 20% identify as Asian, 14% identify as LatinX and 4% identify as Middle Eastern. There are no Black founders in Reach Capital II’s portfolio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reach’s impressive returns come at a time when venture more broadly is booming. A number of investors and founders spoke on background to offer context about whether the returns are impressive for a seed-stage fund of that vintage. One investment strategist said that, while it’s not unheard of in this environment, the return percentage is “crazy good.”</p>
<p>“Easily upper quartile and probably upper decile,” they said. “Unless we are talking crypto, in which case it&#8217;s pretty ordinary.” A separate seed-stage investor pointed to Fred Wilson’s recent blogpost &#8220;<a href="https://avc.com/2021/07/cash-on-cash-vs-irr/">Cash on Cash vs IRR</a>,&#8221; alluding to the idea that holding periods can skew fund performance data.</p>
<p>Still, Reach&#8217;s returns offer an impressive window into how one of the most diverse partnerships in venture capital is performing within one of the most revitalized sectors in startupland. The momentum isn&#8217;t going unnoticed. Filings show that Reach is raising money for a $50 million opportunity fund. The company has been on a hiring spree as of late, too, bringing on <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> from Cowboy Ventures as a partner and<a href="https://twitter.com/tonywan"> Tony Wan</a> from EdSurge as head of investor content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A 22-month-old startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-alums-jobs-app-for-indias-workers-secures-8-million/">helping millions of blue- and gray-collar workers in India</a> learn new skills and find jobs has become the youngest firm to join the coveted unicorn status in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="http://apna.co/">Apna</a> announced on Thursday that it has raised $100 million in a round led by Tiger Global. The new round &#8212; a Series C &#8212; valued Apna at $1.1 billion. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">reported</a> last month that Tiger Global, an existing investor in Apna, was in talks to lead a $100 million financing round in the startup at the unicorn valuation.</p>
<p>Owl Ventures, Insight Partners, Sequoia Capital India, Maverick Ventures and GSV Ventures also participated in the new round, which is the third investment secured by Apna this year. Apna was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">valued at $570 million</a> in its Series B round in June this year.</p>
<p>The investors’ excitement comes as Apna has demonstrated an impressive growth in recent months. The startup has amassed over 16 million users on its 15-month-old eponymous Android app, up from 10 million in June this year.</p>
<p>Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Apna has built a platform that provides a community to these workers. In the community, they engage with each other, exchange notes to perform better at interviews and share tips to negotiate better compensation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203355" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203355" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203355 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apna-app.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203355" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apna</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of this, Apna connects these workers to potential employers. In an interview with TechCrunch, Apna founder and chief executive Nirmit Parikh said more than 150,000 employers &#8212; including Zomato, Bharti AXA, Urban Company, BYJU’S, PhonePe, Burger King, Delhivery, Teamlease and G4S Global &#8212; are on the platform, and over 5 million jobs are active.</p>
<p>The startup, whose name is inspired from a cheerful 2019 Bollywood song, has facilitated over 18 million job interviews in the past 30 days, he said. Apna is currently operational in 28 Indian cities.</p>
<p>The idea for Apna came, Parikh has said, after he was puzzled to find that even as there are hundreds of millions of blue- and gray-collar workers in India, locating them when you need assistance with a task often proves very difficult.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Apna, Parikh, who previously worked at Apple, met these workers and went undercover as an electrician and floor manager to understand the problems they were facing. The problem, he found, was the disconnect. Workers had no means to find who needed them for jobs, and they were also not connected with one another. The community aspect of Apna, which now has over 70 such groups, is aimed at addressing this challenge.</p>
<p>The Apna app allows these workers to learn new skills to become eligible for more work opportunities. Apna has emerged as one of the fastest growing upskilling platforms &#8212; and that would explain why GSV Ventures and Owl Ventures, two high-profile firms known to back edtech startups, are investing in the Bangalore-based firm.</p>
<p>“Apna’s viral adoption is driven by a novel social and interactive approach to connecting employers with job seekers. We expect job seekers in search of meaningful connections and vetted opportunities to drive Apna’s continued explosive growth across India &#8212; and the world,&#8221; said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>Now the startup, which has started to monetize the platform, is ready to aggressively expand. Parikh said Apna will continue to expand to more cities in India and by early next year, Apna will begin its global expansion. Parikh said the startup is eyeing expansion in the USA, South East Asia and Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have already created a dent. Now we want to impact the lives of 2.3 billion,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will require crazy amounts of resources and a world-class team to deliver. It&#8217;s a herculean task, and is going to take a village. But somebody has to solve it.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A startup is a beautiful thing. It’s the tangible outcome of an idea birthed in a garage or on the back of a napkin. But ask any founder what really proves their startup has taken off, and they will almost instantly say it’s when they win their first customer.</p>
<p>That’s easier said than done, though, because winning that first customer will take a lot more than an Ivy-educated founder and/or a celebrity investor pool.</p>
<p>To begin with, you’ll have to craft a strong ideal customer profile to know your customer’s pain points, while developing a competitive SWOT analysis to scope out alternatives your customers can go to.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your target customer will pick a solution that will help them achieve their goals. In other words, your goals should align with your customer’s goals.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>You’ll also need to create a shortlist of influencers who have your customer’s trust, identify their decision-makers who make the call to buy (or not), and create a mapped list of goals that align your customer’s goals to yours.</p>
<p>Understanding and executing on these things can guarantee you that first customer win, provided you do them well and with sincerity. Your investors will also see the fruits of your labor and be comforted knowing their dollars are at good work.</p>
<p>Let’s see how:</p>
<h2>1. Craft the ideal customer profile (ICP)</h2>
<p>The ICP is a great framework for figuring out who your target customer is, how big they are, where they operate, and why they exist. As you write up your ICP, you will soon see the pain points you assumed about them start to become more real.</p>
<p>To create an ICP, you will need to have a strong articulation of the problem you are trying to solve and the customers that experience this problem the most. This will be your baseline hypothesis. Then, as you develop your ICP, keep testing your baseline hypothesis to weed out inaccurate assumptions.</p>
<p>Getting crystal clear here will set you up with the proper launchpad. No shortcuts.</p>
<h3>Here’s how to get started:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Develop an <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/what-is-an-ideal-customer-profile-and-how-do-you-create-one/">ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)</a> framework.</li>
<li>Identify three target customers that fit your defined ICP.</li>
<li>Write a problem statement for each identified target customer.</li>
<li>Prioritize the problem statement that resonates with your product the most.</li>
<li>Lock on the target customer of the prioritized problem statement.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Practice use case:</h3>
<p>You are the co-founder at an upcoming SaaS startup focused on simplifying the shopping experience in car showrooms so buyers enjoy the process. What would your ICP look like?</p>
<h2>2. Develop the SWOT</h2>
<p>The SWOT framework cannot be overrated. This is a great structure to articulate who your competitors are and how you show up against them. Note that your competitors can be direct or indirect (as an alternative), and it’s important to categorize these buckets correctly.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Unlike a weak phone signal solely causing a grainy sound, in growth marketing, it can mean the difference between a successful program or a massive cash bleed. As we move toward an increasingly privacy-centric world, it is even more necessary for companies to nail down signal early on.</p>
<p>So what exactly is “signal” in growth marketing? It can carry many different meanings, but holistically speaking, it’s the event data in our arsenal to help guide decisions. When it comes to paid acquisition, it’s vital to optimize and pass back the correct event data to paid channels. This is so that targeting and bidding algorithms have the most enriched data to utilize.</p>
<p>I’ve seen startups spend thousands of dollars inefficiently as a result of not having optimal signal in their paid acquisition campaigns. I’ve also spent millions at companies such as Postmates refining our signal to the best possible state. I’d like every startup to avoid the painful mistake of not having this set up correctly, instead making the most of every important ad dollar.</p>
<h2>The selection</h2>
<p>When starting out, it may seem obvious to optimize toward a north-star metric such as a purchase. If spend is very minimal, that could mean that the conversion volume will be low across campaigns. On the flip side, if the optimization event is set at a top-of-funnel event such as a landing page view, the signal strength may be very weak. The reason that the strength may be weak is due to passing back a low-intent event as successful to the paid channels. By marking a landing page view as successful, paid channels such as Facebook will continue to find users that are similar to these lower-propensity users that are converting.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example of a health-and-wellness app with a goal of driving memberships to their coaching program. They’re just starting out with exploring paid acquisition and spending $5,000 per week on Facebook. Below is a look at their events in the funnel, weekly volume and cost per event:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202596" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202596" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2202596 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=768,301 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=680,266 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM-1.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202596" class="wp-caption-text">Example of a health-and-wellness app and their weekly conversion volume at $5,000 spend. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>In the above example, we can see that there’s significant volume for landing page views. As we go down the <em>simplified</em> flow, there is less volume as users drop off the funnel. Almost everyone’s instinct would be to optimize for either the landing page view, because there’s so much data, or the subscription event, because it’s the strongest. I would argue (after extensive testing across multiple ad accounts) that neither of these events would be the correct pick. With landing page views as an optimization event, the users have an egregiously low propensity since the landing page view to subscription conversion rate is 0.61%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The correct event to optimize for here would either be sign up or trial start because they have sufficient enough volume and are strong signals of a user converting to the north-star metric (subscription). Looking at the conversion rate between sign up and subscription, it’s a much healthier 10.21%, versus the 0.61% from landing page view.</p>
<p>I’m always a huge proponent of testing all events, as there can definitely be big surprises in what may work best for you. When testing events, make sure that there’s a stat-sig baseline that’s being followed to make decisions. Additionally, I think it’s a great practice to test events regularly early on because conversion rates can change as other channel variables are adjusted.</p>
<h2>Flow adjustments</h2>
<p>In certain cases, the current events that are set up aren’t optimal for paid acquisition campaigns. I’ve seen this happen frequently with startups that have long windows of time between conversion events. Take a startup such as Thumbtack, which provides a marketplace of providers who can help with home repairs. After someone signs up to their app, the user may place a request but not hire someone until a few weeks later. In this case, making flow adjustments could potentially improve the signal and data that you collect from users.</p>
<p>A solution that Thumbtack could implement to gather a stronger signal would be to add another step between the request being placed and hiring someone. This could potentially be a survey with propensity check questions that could ask how soon the user needs help or how important their project is from a 1–10.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202600" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202600" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2202600" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png" alt="" width="882" height="564" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/JM2.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202600" class="wp-caption-text">Example of in-app survey responses to “How important is your project?” <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez.</p></div></p>
<p>After accumulating the data, if there’s a high correlation between survey answers and someone starting their project, we can start to explore optimizing for that event.</p>
<p>In the above example, we see that users who responded with “9” have a 7.66% likelihood to convert. Therefore, this should be the event we optimize for. Artificially adding steps that qualify users in a longer flow can help steer optimization targeting in the right direction.</p>
<h2>Enhancing signal</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that you have the most ideal flow that captures large volumes of event signal without much of a delay to your optimization event. That’s still far from perfect. There are myriad solutions that can be implemented to further enhance the signal.</p>
<p>For Facebook specifically, there are connections such as<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2020/conversion-api-capi-overview/"> CAPI</a> that can be integrated to pass back data in a more accurate way. CAPI is a method of passing back web events server-to-server rather than relying on cookies and the Facebook pixel. This helps mitigate browsers that block cookies or users who may delete their web history. This is just one example. I won’t run through all the channels, but each has its own solution to help enhance event signal being passed back to it.</p>
<h2>iOS 14 signal</h2>
<p>This wouldn’t be a column written in 2021 without mention of iOS 14 and the strategies that can be leveraged for this growing user segment. I’ve written another <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/impactful-strategies-amid-ios14">piece</a> about iOS-14-specific tactics, but I’ll cover it here on a broad level. If the north-star metric (i.e., purchase) event can be triggered within 24 hours of the initial app launch, then that’s golden.</p>
<p>This would bring large volumes of high-intent data that would not be at the mercy of the SKAD 24-hour event timer. For most companies, this may sound like a lofty goal, so the target should be to have an event fire within 24 hours that is a high-likelihood indicator of someone completing your north-star metric. Think of which events happen in the flow that lead to someone eventually purchasing. Maybe someone adding a payment method happens within 24 hours and historically has a 90% conversion rate to someone purchasing. An “add payment info” event would be a great conversion event to use in this case. The landscape of iOS 14 is constantly changing but this should apply for the immediate future.</p>
<h2>Incrementality and staying ahead</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, incrementality checks should constantly be performed in growth marketing. It gives an important read on whether advertising dollars are bringing in users that wouldn’t have converted had they not seen an ad.</p>
<p>When comparing optimization events, this rule still applies. Make sure that costs per action aren’t the only metric that’s being used as a measure of success, but instead, use the incremental lift on each conversion event as the ultimate key performance indicator. <a href="https://jmstrategy.substack.com/p/easy-incrementality-testing">In this piece,</a> I detail how to run lean incrementality tests without swarms of data scientists.</p>
<p>So how do you stay ahead and continue moving the needle on your growth marketing campaigns? First and foremost, constantly question the events you’re optimizing for. And second, leave no stone unturned.</p>
<p>If you’re using the same optimization event forever, it will be a disservice to your campaign performance potential. By experimenting with flow changes and running tests on new events, you’ll be way ahead of the curve. When iterating on the flow, think about user behavior and events from the user’s perspective. Which flow events, if added, would correlate to a high propensity conversion segment?</p>

<p>Gregory led NPR&#8217;s Arts Desk for the last seven years, shaping the news outlet&#8217;s culture and entertainment coverage. &#8220;As an audio journalist, [Clubhouse] aligned with what I&#8217;ve always believed is the best medium for news,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/media/clubhouse-head-of-news/index.html">Gregory told CNN</a>. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to know how to read to be able to hear radio news.

<p>Helping publishers and other brands get plugged in is one path toward maturation for Clubhouse. Online media properties from USA Today to TechCrunch have built a presence on the app, which exploded in growth as the pandemic limited in-person social interactions. But with competition from more entrenched competitors looming, Clubhouse may need to get creative to stay in the game.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s quick ascent saw Twitter, Spotify, Facebook and other established tech companies scramble to integrate live audio rooms into their own products. Twitter quickly launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twitter-spaces/">Spaces</a>, while Spotify launched a standalone Clubhouse clone known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/spotifys-clubhouse-rival-greenroom-tops-140k-installs-on-ios-100k-on-android/">Greenroom</a>. Facebook first announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">its own live audio rooms</a> in April, opening them to U.S. users two months later.</p>

<p>The kind of viral attention that Clubhouse enjoyed over the last year is almost impossible to maintain, but the company has added features, introduced an Android app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">opened its doors to everyone</a>. Clubhouse might not be able to top its February peak, but the app still notched 7.7 million global monthly downloads after expanding to Android this summer, and continues to build out its vision for audio-first social networking.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">reported</a> Silicon Valley’s worst-kept secret: Instagram harms teens’ mental health; in fact, its impact is so negative that it introduces suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Thirty-two percent of teen girls who feel bad about their bodies report that Instagram makes them feel worse. Of teens with suicidal thoughts, 13% of British and 6% of American users trace those thoughts to Instagram, the WSJ report said. This is Facebook’s internal data. The truth is surely worse.</p>
<p>President Theodore Roosevelt and Congress <a href=" https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/when-and-why-was-fda-formed">formed</a> the Food and Drug Administration in 1906 precisely because Big Food and Big Pharma failed to protect the general welfare. As its executives <a href="https://www.justjared.com/2021/09/13/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-wife-monica-sport-geometric-outfits-for-met-gala-2021/">parade</a> at the Met Gala in celebration of the unattainable 0.01% of lifestyles and bodies that we mere mortals will never achieve, Instagram’s unwillingness to do what is right is a clarion call for regulation: The FDA must assert its codified right to regulate the algorithm powering the drug of Instagram.</p>
<p>The FDA should consider algorithms a drug impacting our nation’s mental health: The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title21-section321&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim">gives</a> the FDA the right to regulate drugs, defining drugs in part as “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” Instagram’s internal data shows its technology is an article that alters our brains. If this effort fails, Congress and President Joe Biden should create a mental health FDA.</p>

			Researchers can study what Facebook prioritizes and the impact those decisions have on our minds. How do we know this? Because Facebook is already doing it — they&#8217;re just burying the results.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The public needs to understand what Facebook and Instagram’s algorithms prioritize. Our government is equipped to study clinical trials of products that can physically harm the public. Researchers can study what Facebook privileges and the impact those decisions have on our minds. How do we know this? Because Facebook is already doing it — they&#8217;re just burying the results.</p>
<p>In November 2020, as Cecilia Kang and Sheera Frenkel report in “<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/pages/anuglytruth">An Ugly Truth</a>,” Facebook made an emergency change to its News Feed, putting more emphasis on “News Ecosystem Quality” scores (NEQs). High NEQ sources were trustworthy sources; low were untrustworthy. Facebook altered the algorithm to privilege high NEQ scores. As a result, for five days around the election, users saw a “nicer News Feed” with less fake news and fewer conspiracy theories. But Mark Zuckerberg reversed this change because it led to less engagement and could cause a conservative backlash. The public suffered for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook likewise has studied what happens when the algorithm privileges content that is “good for the world” over content that is “bad for the world.” Lo and behold, engagement decreases. Facebook knows that its algorithm has a remarkable impact on the minds of the American public. How can the government let one man decide the standard based on his business imperatives, not the general welfare?</p>
<p>Upton Sinclair memorably uncovered dangerous abuses in “The Jungle,” which led to a public outcry. The free market failed. Consumers needed protection. The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act for the first time promulgated safety standards, regulating consumable goods impacting our physical health. Today, we need to regulate the algorithms that impact our mental health. Teen depression has risen <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/12/a-growing-number-of-american-teenagers-particularly-girls-are-facing-depression/">alarmingly</a> since 2007. Likewise, suicide among those 10 to 24 is up nearly 60% between 2007 and 2018.</p>
<p>It is of course impossible to prove that social media is solely responsible for this increase, but it is absurd to argue it has not contributed. Filter bubbles distort our views and make them more extreme. Bullying online is easier and constant. Regulators must audit the algorithm and question Facebook’s choices.</p>
<p>When it comes to the biggest issue Facebook poses — what the product <em>does to us —</em> regulators have struggled to articulate the problem. Section 230 is correct in its intent and application; the internet cannot function if platforms are liable for every user utterance. And a private company like Facebook loses the trust of its community if it applies arbitrary rules that target users based on their background or political beliefs. Facebook as a company has no explicit duty to uphold the First Amendment, but public perception of its fairness is essential to the brand.</p>
<p>Thus, Zuckerberg has equivocated over the years before belatedly banning Holocaust deniers, Donald Trump, anti-vaccine activists and other bad actors. Deciding what speech is privileged or allowed on its platform, Facebook will always be too slow to react, overcautious and ineffective. Zuckerberg cares only for engagement and growth. Our hearts and minds are caught in the balance.</p>
<p>The most frightening part of “The Ugly Truth,” the passage that got everyone in Silicon Valley talking, was the eponymous memo: Andrew “Boz” Bosworth’s 2016 “The Ugly.”</p>
<p>In the memo, Bosworth, Zuckerberg’s longtime deputy, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is <em>de facto</em> good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg made Bosworth walk back his statements when employees objected, but to outsiders, the memo represents the unvarnished id of Facebook, the ugly truth. Facebook’s monopoly, its stranglehold on our social and political fabric, its growth at all costs mantra of “connection,” is not de facto good. As Bosworth acknowledges, Facebook causes suicides and allows terrorists to organize. This much power concentrated in the hands of one corporation, run by one man, is a threat to our democracy and way of life.</p>
<p>Critics of FDA regulation of social media will claim this is a Big Brother invasion of our personal liberties. But what is the alternative? Why would it be bad for our government to demand that Facebook accounts to the public its internal calculations? Is it safe for the number of sessions, time spent and revenue growth to be the only results that matters? What about the collective mental health of the country and world?</p>
<p>Refusing to study the problem does not mean it does not exist. In the absence of action, we are left with a single man deciding what is right. What is the price we pay for “connection”? This is not up to Zuckerberg. The FDA should decide.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Social media has served as a launchpad to success almost as long as it has been around. The stories of going viral from a self-produced YouTube video and then securing a record deal established the mythology of social media platforms. Ever since, social media has consistently gravitated away from text-based formats and toward visual mediums like video sharing.</p>
<p>For most people, a video on social media won’t be a ticket to stardom, but in recent months, there have been a growing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/technology/tiktok-resumes-jobs.html">number of stories</a> of people getting hired based on videos posted to TikTok. Even LinkedIn has embraced video assets on user profiles with the recent addition of the “<a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/march/30/-bring-your-professional-story-to-life-on-linkedin">Cover Story</a>” feature, which allows workers to supplement their profiles with a video about themselves.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, is there room for a world where your primary resume is a video on TikTok? And if so, what kinds of unintended consequences and implications might this have on the workforce?</p>
<h2>Why is TikTok trending for jobs?</h2>
<p>In recent months, U.S. job openings have risen to an all-time high of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-4c614d89c69b4afd3504a4d92dd574f9">10.1 million</a>. For the first time since the pandemic began, available jobs have exceeded available workers. Employers are struggling to attract qualified candidates to fill positions, and in that light, it makes sense that many recruiters are turning to social platforms like TikTok and video resumes to find talent.</p>
<p>But the scarcity of workers does not negate the importance of finding the right employee for a role. Especially important for recruiters is finding candidates with the skills that align with their business’ goals and strategy. For example, as more organizations embrace a data-driven approach to operating their business, they need more people with skills in analytics and machine learning to help them make sense of the data they collect.</p>
<p>Recruiters have proven to be open to innovation where it helps them find these new candidates. Recruiting is no longer the manual process it used to be, with HR teams sorting through stacks of paper resumes and formal cover letters to find the right candidate. They embraced the power of online connections as LinkedIn rose to prominence and even figured out how to use third-party job sites like GlassDoor to help them draw in promising candidates. On the back end, many recruiters use advanced cloud software to sort through incoming resumes to find the candidates that best match their job descriptions. But all of these methods still rely on the traditional text-based resume or profile as the core of any application.</p>
<p>Videos on social media provide the ability for candidates to demonstrate soft skills that may not be immediately apparent in written documents, such as verbal communication and presentation skills. They are also a way for recruiters to learn more about the personality of the candidate to determine how they’d fit into the culture of the company. While this may be appealing for many, are we ready for the consequences?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>We’re not ready for the close-up</h2>
<p>While innovation in recruiting is a big part of the future of work, the hype around TikTok and video resumes may actually take us backward. Despite offering a new way for candidates to market themselves for opportunities, it also carries potential pitfalls that candidates, recruiters and business leaders need to be aware of.</p>
<p>The very element that gives video resumes their potential also presents the biggest problems. Video inescapably highlights the person behind the skills and achievements. As recruiters form their first opinions about a candidate, they will be confronted with information they do not usually see until much later in the process, including whether they belong to protected classes because of their race, disability or gender.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) concerns have had a major surge in attention over the last couple of years amid heightened awareness and scrutiny around how employers are &#8212; or are not &#8212; prioritizing diversity in the workplace.</p>
<p>But evaluating candidates through video could erase any progress made by introducing more opportunities for unconscious, or even conscious, bias. This could create a dangerous situation for businesses if they do not act carefully because it could open them up to consequences such as damage to their reputation or even something as severe as discrimination lawsuits.</p>
<p>A company with a poor track record for diversity may have the fact that they reviewed videos from candidates used against them in court. Recruiters reviewing the videos may not even be aware of how the race or gender of candidates are impacting their decisions. For that reason, many of the businesses I have seen implement an option for video in their recruiting flow do not allow their recruiters to watch the video until late in the recruiting process.</p>
<p>But even if businesses address the most pressing issues of DE&amp;I by managing bias against those protected classes, by accepting videos there are still issues of diversity in less protected classes such as neurodiversity and socioeconomic status. A candidate with exemplary skills and a strong track record may not present themselves well through a video, coming across as awkward to the recruiter watching the video. Even if that impression is irrelevant to the job, it could still influence the recruiter’s stance on hiring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, candidates from affluent backgrounds may have access to better equipment and software to record and edit a compelling video resume. Other candidates may not, resulting in videos that may not look as polished or professional in the eyes of the recruiter. This creates yet another barrier to the opportunities they can access.</p>
<p>As we sit at an important crossroads in how we handle DE&amp;I in the workplace, it is important for employers and recruiters to find ways to reduce bias in the processes they use to find and hire employees. While innovation is key to moving our industry forward, we have to ensure top priorities are not being compromised.</p>
<h2>Not left on the cutting room floor</h2>
<p>Despite all of these concerns, social media platforms &#8212; especially those based on video &#8212; have created new opportunities for users to expand their personal brands and connect with potential job opportunities. There is potential to use these new systems to benefit both job seekers and employers.</p>
<p>The first step is to ensure that there is always a place for a traditional text-based resume or profile in the recruiting process. Even if recruiters can get all the information they need about a candidate’s capabilities from video, some people will just naturally feel more comfortable staying off camera. Hiring processes need to be about letting people put their best foot forward, whether that is in writing or on video. And that includes accepting that the best foot to put forward may not be your own.</p>
<p>Instead, candidates and businesses should consider using videos as a place for past co-workers or managers to endorse the candidate. An outside endorsement can do a lot more good for an application than simply stating your own strengths because it shows that someone else believes in your capabilities, too.</p>
<p>Video resumes are hot right now because they are easier to make and share than ever and because businesses are in desperate need of strong talent. But before we get caught up in the novelty of this new way of sharing our credentials, we need to make sure that we are setting ourselves up for success.</p>
<p>The goal of any new recruiting technology should be to make it easier for candidates to find opportunities where they can shine without creating new barriers. There are some serious kinks to work out before video resumes can achieve that, and it is important for employers to consider the repercussions before they damage the success of their DE&amp;I efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The &#8220;eBay of NFTs&#8221; is running into a scandal as it admits one of its employees traded the crypto digital assets using insider information from the platform.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a top executive at NFT platform OpenSea was accused of front-running sales on the platform, purchasing pieces from NFT collections before they were featured on the homepage of the platform. According to Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV">@ZuwuTV,</a> the startup&#8217;s Head of Product was using secret crypto wallets to buy drops before they listed on the main page of OpenSea, selling them shortly after they were highlighted publicly by OpenSea, and funneling the profits back to his main account. Users linked to a handful of transactions from accounts linked back to the executive on the public blockchain including an NFT drop that was, at the time, actively listed on the front page of the platform.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Today, OpenSea seemed to acknowledge the incident, <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/">saying in a blog post</a> that it had &#8220;learned that one of our employees purchased items that they knew were set to display on our front page before they appeared there publicly.&#8221; The company did not identify the employee but said that they were conducting an &#8220;immediate&#8221; review of the incident. The startup, which was recently valued at $1.5 billion after raising a $100 million Series B from Andreessen Horowitz, added in the unsigned blog post that this incident was &#8220;incredibly disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re conducting a thorough review of yesterday’s incident and are committed to doing the right thing for OpenSea users,&#8221; OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1438122446847201283">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>OpenSea, which did a record $3.4 billion in transaction volume last month, appears not to have had any rules in places preventing employees from using confidential information to buy or sell NFTs on its own platform to its own users. The company detailed that it was now implementing a policy that team members could not buy or sell &#8220;from collections or creators while we are featuring or promoting them,&#8221; and that they are &#8220;prohibited from using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most NFTs are not generally assumed to be securities, despite little official guidance from the SEC on the crypto asset class. Some in the space have questioned whether different mechanics around buying and selling, alongside ongoing rewards structures may be pushing some NFT sales further into securities territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many have been enticed by dramatic jumps in the value of new digital assets,&#8221; Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown said in a hearing yesterday &#8212; as transcribed by <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec">The Block</a> &#8212; where the relationship between crypto markets and SEC enforcement was discussed. &#8220;Some professional investors and celebrities make earning millions look easy. But, as we are reminded time and again, it’s never that simple – and too often, someone’s quick profit comes at the expense of workers and entire communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to OpenSea for further comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer communication platform <a href="https://front.com">Front</a> is holding an event today to introduce three new features. These new features focus on showing you more information about your customers right from Front’s user interface.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Front, the company started as a shared email inbox product so that you can interact with incoming emails as a team. For instance, if your company uses email lists, such as support@companyname.com, sales@companyname.com or jobs@companyname.com, multiple team members can see incoming emails in Front.</p>
<p>Before replying, you can triage conversations by assigning them to specific team members, discuss the current conversation in the comment section or show your email draft before sending it.</p>
<p>Over time, Front has evolved to integrate more communication channels. You can now use Front for SMS conversations, live chat on your website with your customers, Facebook messages, etc. The company has also refined its product with more powerful features.</p>
<p>For instance, you can set up rules to automate your workflow with simple &#8220;if this then that&#8221; rules. It’s a good way to spread out work across multiple team members and make sure the right person sees the incoming message as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Today, the company is showcasing features that will be particularly useful for teams that interact with bigger customers, such as sales, support and customer success teams. First, Front users will be able to learn more about the customer they’re interacting with directly from their inbox.</p>
<p>The refreshed context panel works better if the team is interacting with multiple people working for your client. Instead of viewing past conversations with someone in particular, you can view past conversations with everyone working for this client.</p>
<p>Front already integrates with your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. You can now more easily pull data into the context panel. You can see the name of the account owner, the customer segment and the SLA (service-level agreement) commitment with this customer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203128" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203128" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203128" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png" alt="" width="1024" height="704" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=768,528 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=1536,1056 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203128" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Front</p></div></p>
<p>Second, Front is adding new capabilities for its automated routing feature with deeper integrations with your CRM. For instance, you can find the name of the account owner in your CRM and assign incoming emails to the account owner directly.</p>
<p>If the account owner changes in Salesforce, rules will be automatically updated in Front. You can also fetch annual revenue data from your CRM and set a VIP tag if you’re receiving a message from an important customer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203129" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203129" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2203129" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png" alt="" width="1024" height="704" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=768,528 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=1536,1056 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203129" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Front</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Front will soon upgrade the analytics pages. For instance, you can track the team’s performance for a specific account and compare that to the SLA.</p>
<p>These updates position Front as a tool that works better for bigger enterprise clients with expensive B2B contracts. Current Front customers include Shopify, Dropbox, Flexport, Checkout.com, Lydia and Airbnb.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an Extra Crunch summer. We&#8217;ve heard how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">craft your pitch deck around the one thing that really hooks an investor</a>, and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">the industry experience of Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong ticked every box for Emergence</a> when raising her Series A. And that&#8217;s just the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also gotten a sneak peek at the Disrupt Startup Alley companies in our summer episodes of Extra Crunch Live: Startup Alley Edition.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more where that came from this fall. Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.</p>
<p>So, let me try that again.</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> is further nudging users away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/password/">passwords</a> by rolling out passwordless sign-in options to all consumer Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>The tech giant, like many others in the industry, has waged a war against traditional password-based authentication for some time. This is because passwords are a prime target for cyberattacks, since weak or reused passwords can be guessed or brute-forced through automated attacks.</p>
<p>To that end, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/windows-11-launches-october-5/">and as it gears up to launch Windows 11 in just a few weeks</a>, Microsoft is rolling out its passwordless sign-in option, previously available only to commercial customers, to all Microsoft accounts. This means that users will be able to sign in to services, such as Outlook and OneDrive, without having to use a password. Instead, users can use the Microsoft Authenticator app, Windows Hello, a security key and SMS or emailed codes.</p>
<p>Some Microsoft apps will still continue to require a password, however, including Office 2010 or earlier, Remote Desktop and Xbox 360. Similarly, those using now-unsupported versions of Windows won&#8217;t be able to ditch their passwords just yet either, as the feature will only be supported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/windows-10/">Windows 10</a> and Windows 11.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that passwordless sign-in will be rolled out to consumer accounts over the coming weeks, so you might not be able to get rid of your password just yet. It added that it’s also working on a way to eliminate passwords for Azure AD accounts, with admins set to be able to choose whether passwords are required, allowed or don&#8217;t exist for specific users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.smartnews.com/en/">SmartNews</a>, a Tokyo-headquartered news aggregation website and app that&#8217;s grown in popularity despite hefty competition from built-in aggregators like Apple News, today announced it has closed on $230 million in Series F funding. The round brings SmartNews&#8217; total raise to date to over $400 million and values the business at $2 billion &#8212; or as the company touts<a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/2021/09/15/smartnews-raises-230-million-in-series-f-funding-at-a-2-billion-valuation-plans-to-invest-in-u-s-growth/"> in its press release</a>, a &#8220;double unicorn.&#8221; (Ha!)</p>
<p>The funding included new U.S. investors Princeville Capital and Woodline Partners, as well as JIC Venture Growth Investments, Green Co-Invest Investment, and Yamauchi-No.10 Family Office in Japan. Existing investors participating in this round included ACA Investments and SMBC Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012 in Japan, the company launched to the U.S. in 2014 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities/">expanded its local news footprint </a>early last year. While the app&#8217;s content team includes former journalists, machine learning is used to pick which articles are shown to readers to personalize their experience. However, one of the app&#8217;s key differentiators is how it works to pop users&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>&#8221; through its &#8220;News From All Sides&#8221; feature, which allows its users to access news from across a range of political perspectives.</p>
<p>It has also developed new products, like its Covid-19 vaccine dashboard and U.S. election dashboard, that provide critical information at a glance. With the additional funds, the company says it plans to develop more features for its U.S. audience &#8212; one of its largest, in addition to Japan &#8212;  that will focus on consumer health and safety. These will roll out in the next few months and will include features for tracking wildfires and crime and safety reports. It also recently launched a hurricane tracker.</p>
<p>The aggregator&#8217;s business model is largely focused on advertising, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/smartnews-funding/">the company has said before</a> that 85-80% of Americans aren&#8217;t paying to subscribe to news. But SmartNews&#8217; belief is that these news consumers still have a right to access quality information.</p>
<p>In total, SmartNews has relationships with over 3,000 global publishing partners whose content is available through its service on the web and mobile devices.</p>
<p>To generate revenue, the company sells inline ads and video ads, where revenue is shared with publishers. Over 75% of its publishing partners also take advantage of its &#8220;<a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/2016/07/29/introducing-smartview-first-read-more-faster/">SmartView</a>&#8221; feature. This is the app&#8217;s quick-reading mode, and alternative to something like Google AMP. Here, users can quickly load an article to read, even if they&#8217;re offline. The company <a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/publishers/">promises publishers</a> that these mobile-friendly stories, which are marked with a lightning bolt icon in the app, deliver higher engagement &#8212; and its algorithm rewards that type of content, bringing them more readers. Among SmartView partners are well-known brands like USA Today, ABC, HuffPost, and others. Currently, over 70% of all SmartNews&#8217; pageviews are coming from SmartView first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SmartNews&#8217; app has proven to be very sticky, in terms of attracting and keeping users&#8217; attention. The company tells us, citing App Annie July 2021 data, that it sees an average time spent per user per month on U.S. mobile devices that&#8217;s higher than Google News or Apple News combined.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203126" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203126" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png 1576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=1536,754 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie data provided by SmartNews</p></div></p>
<p>The company declined to share its monthly active users (MAUs), but had said in 2019 it had grown to 20 million in the U.S. and Japan. Today, it says its U.S. MAUs doubled over the last year.</p>
<p>According to data provided to us by <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, the SmartNews app has seen around 85 million downloads since its October 2014 launch, and 14 million of those took place in the past 365 days. Japan is the largest market for installs, accounting for 59% of lifetime downloads, the firm noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This latest round of funding further affirms the strength of our mission, and fuels our drive to expand our presence and launch features that specifically appeal to users and publishers in the United States,&#8221; said SmartNews co-founder and CEO Ken Suzuki. &#8220;Our investors both in the U.S. and globally acknowledge the tremendous growth potential and value of SmartNews’s efforts to democratize access to information and create an ecosystem that benefits consumers, publishers, and advertisers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company says the new funds will be used to invest in further U.S. growth and expanding the company&#8217;s team. Since<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/news-discovery-app-smartnews-valued-at-1-1b/"> its last fundraise in 2019</a>, where it became a unicorn, the company more than doubled its headcount to approximately 500 people globally. it now plans to double its headcount of 100 in the U.S., with additions across engineering, product, and leadership roles.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports SmartNews is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartnews-app-raises-230-million-considers-possible-ipo-11631700001">exploring an IPO</a>, but the company declined to comment on this.</p>
<p>The SmartNews app is available on iOS and Android across more than 150 countries worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retail investors love him. Venture capitalists envy him. But pretty much everyone writing checks these days is paying attention to Chamath Palihapitiya, whose star has been on the rise since the outset of his career at an early online media player called Winamp that was acquired by AOL.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the last 20 years, Palihapitiya &#8212; whose family moved from Sri Lanka to Canada as refugees when he was five &#8212; has been changing up the status quo of nearly everything he touches. At AOL, he became the company&#8217;s youngest VP and wound up doing a small deal with Facebook whose &#8220;biggest outcome of the deal was the connection Palihapitiya formed with Mark Zuckerberg,&#8221; as writer Steven Levy <a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-untold-history-of-facebooks-most-controversial-growth-tool-2ea3bfeaaa66">reported last year</a>. (Palihapitiya later said that one of his biggest takeaways from AOL was that, &#8220;Most people at most companies are <a href="https://genius.com/Chamath-palihapitiya-how-we-put-facebook-on-the-path-to-1-billion-users-annotated">really shit</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Hired into Facebook in 2007, his role there would prove more seminal. Though Palihapitiya reportedly floundered at first &#8212; even proposing after a year that Zuckerberg should perhaps fire him, according to Levy &#8212; he zeroed in on how to make both himself and Facebook more valuable by building a data-driven &#8220;growth team&#8221; that focused relentlessly on improving and growing the engagement of monthly active users.</p>
<p>Among its biggest successes: Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;People You Know&#8221; feature, which was heavily inspired by a similar LinkedIn feature after Palihapitiya&#8217;s team identified that new users needed to discover seven friends and fast.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kQCUEa4qJZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds is coming to Disrupt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ryan Reynolds is coming to Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/embed/#?secret=kQCUEa4qJZ" data-secret="kQCUEa4qJZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That period of Palihapitiya&#8217;s life would have wide-ranging ripple effects. For one thing, like a lot of people working at Facebook before it went public in 2012, he made a fortune from his Facebook shares, such that around the same time that he was leaving in 2011, he acquired a stake in the Golden State Warriors and founded his own venture capital firm, Social Capital.</p>
<p>Being a &#8220;former Facebook exec&#8221; also made Palihapitiya more widely famous, including as he began expressing regret publicly over his role with the company, which he began to see as corrosive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In just one of many related appearances in 2017, he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16761016/former-facebook-exec-ripping-apart-society">told an audience</a> at the Stanford Graduate School of Business what many had already begun to fear about Facebook: “I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More drama, more money and more fame have followed. In recent years, Social Capital has shed most of its employees &#8212; Palihapitiya now describes himself as a solo GP. He has become a regular guest on CNBC.</p>
<p>He has become closely identified with special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, owing both to his early and bullish embrace of them. The first SPAC he organized merged with Virgin Galactic Holdings, enabling the space tourism company to begin trading publicly in October 2019. It performed so well that it kicked off a massive boom in SPAC activity, with Palihapitiya &#8212; whose many earlier bets include Yammer, Palantir and Box &#8212; forming or investing in more than a dozen SPACs since, including one that took public Opendoor<b> </b>and another that took public Clover Health. (Earlier this year, The New Yorker dedicated valuable real estate to Palihapitiya in a profile titled, &#8220;The Pied Piper of SPACs.&#8221;)</p>
<p>One question is whether Palihapitiya is now moving on. SPAC activity has cooled, with enthusiasm around the vehicles dampened by class-action lawsuits (including against Clover Health) and the widespread expectation that the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is about to regulate them more closely.</p>
<p>Back in March, Palihapitiya was also believed to be shifting his gaze toward environmental investment, including through the sale of his entire personal stake in Virgin Galactic for more than $200 million &#8212; a move he said was designed to help finance &#8220;a large investment I am making towards <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spac-king-chamath-palihapitiya-plans-1-billion-listing-climate-company-2021-3">fighting climate change</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>(He also late last month donated $7 million to an organization that is affixing hydropanels that supply clean water to homes in the California counties of Fresno, Monterey, Kern and Tulare, which has become &#8220;ground zero&#8221; for the climate crisis, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90669730/chamath-palihapitiya-pledges-7-million-to-california-hydropanels-that-pull-water-out-of-air">observes Fast Company</a>.)</p>
<p>What has come of that large investment he was planning to make? Is he past SPACs? And what else does the inimitable Palihapitiya have cooking? We&#8217;re very excited to say we&#8217;ll have the opportunity to talk with him about all of these things and much more in roughly one week at TechCrunch Disrupt, our signature annual event, which is entirely virtual this year. While 25 minutes will surely prove too short a time, we&#8217;ll cover as much ground with him as we can in a conversation that, if you know Palihapitiya at all, you know you definitely don&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>Even better, Palihapitiya joins a whole host of amazing speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt</a>, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p>
<p>The show is coming up fast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 just for a few short days, and we&#8217;ll see you next week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The total addressable market that Forge serves is growing by the day, with more and more unicorns being born and a steady drumbeat of unicorn IPOs doing little to clear the decks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">Freshworks</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">Amplitude</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast</a> look to list in the coming weeks, we shouldn&#8217;t forget the SPAC boom. This week, for example, Forge Global (Forge), a technology startup that operates a market for secondary transactions in private companies, announced that it would go public via a blank-check combination.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re not unpacking every single SPAC combination that crosses our radar, the Forge deal is a good one to spend time parsing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Why? Several reasons. First, we&#8217;re curious about how the company generates revenue and how diversified its revenue is. We&#8217;re also interested in how big the market may prove to be for trading secondary shares in unicorns &#8212; late-stage tech startup equity is popular on secondary exchanges. Additionally, we want to know whether the deal feels expensive, because that may help us get a heat-check on the SPAC market more broadly.</p>

Then we get to have fun. To work!</p>
<h2>The Forge SPAC</h2>
<p>Forge is <a href="https://forgeglobal.com/press-releases/forge-global-to-go-public-in-2-billion-merger-with-motive-capital/">merging</a> with Motive Capital, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73990/Fintech-SPAC-Motive-Capital-prices-upsized-$360-million-IPO-at-$10">raised $360 million</a> in December 2020.</p>
<p>Per the company&#8217;s calculations, the combined entity will sport a roughly $2 billion valuation on a &#8220;fully diluted equity value on a pro forma basis.&#8221; The company&#8217;s anticipated <em>enterprise</em> value is a smaller $1.6 billion thanks to an expected $435 million in cash after the deal&#8217;s completion, though that number will change some before it trades.</p>
<p>Skipping the nuances of the transaction &#8212; there&#8217;s a PIPE, 90% equity rollover from existing shareholders and more, in case you wanted to get into it &#8212; what matters is that Forge will be worth around $2 billion in equity terms and have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank after the deal.</p>
<p>The resulting valuation is notable not only for making Forge a unicorn, but also for representing a dramatic upward movement in the worth of the company. PitchBook and Crunchbase data agree that Forge was last valued at $700 million (post-money) when raising $150 million earlier this year. So, the company appears set to provide a solid return to more than just its early backers; even the private investors who put capital into the company rather recently should do well in the deal.</p>
<p>That brings us to the company&#8217;s business, and business model. Forge helps pre-IPO companies trade before they float. It&#8217;s somewhat ironic that price discovery is something that the company claims its platform can help companies with before they debut, while the company is set to see its private valuation quickly beaten by a public debut.</p>
<p>Regardless, let&#8217;s talk unicorns.</p>
<h2>A solution to the unicorn traffic jam?</h2>
<p>One of my favorite long-term issues with the late-stage startup market is that it is far better at creating value than it is at finding an exit point for that accreted value. More simply, the startup market is excellent at creating unicorns but somewhat poor at taking them public.</p>
<p>That antitrust regulatory concerns have made it harder for wealthy tech companies to snap up promising startups that could challenge them is only part of the matter. There just aren&#8217;t enough IPOs, even this year, to counterbalance the growth in the number of global unicorns.</p>
<p>That pressure is a good bit of why Forge is an interesting firm. The more unexited unicorns there are in the world, the more demand, presumably, there is for marketplaces like the one it operates, which allows existing shareholders in valuable private companies to drive liquidity for themselves ahead of eventual public-market debuts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.relyance.ai/">Relyance AI</a>, an early-stage startup that is helping companies stay in compliance with privacy laws at the code level, announced a $25 million Series A today. At the same time, they revealed a previously unannounced $5 million seed round.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures led the A round, while Unusual was sole lead on the seed. Serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal from Unusual will join the board under the terms of the deal. His partner John Vrionis had previously joined after the seed round. Matt Murphy from Menlo is coming on as a board observer. The company has now raised $30 million.</p>
<p>Relyance takes an unusual approach to verifying that data stays in compliance working at the code level, while ingesting contracts and existing legal requirements as code to ensure that a company is in compliance. Company co-CEO and co-founder Abhi Sharma says that code-level check is key to the solution. &#8220;For the first time, we are building the legal compliance and regulation into the source code,&#8221; Sharma told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pBcfHJdaYy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">WTF is GDPR?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WTF is GDPR?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/embed/#?secret=pBcfHJdaYy" data-secret="pBcfHJdaYy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;Relyance is actually embedded within the DevOps pipeline of our customers&#8217; infrastructure. So every time a new ETL pipeline is built or a machine learning model is receiving new source code, we do a compiler-like analysis of how personal sensitive data is flowing between internal microservices, data lakes and data warehouses, and then get a metadata analysis back to the privacy and compliance professionals [inside an organization].&#8221;</p>
<p>Leila R. Golchehreh, the other founder and co-CEO, brings a strong compliance background to the equation and has experienced the challenge of keeping companies in compliance firsthand. She said that Relyance also enables companies to define policy and contracts as code.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is specifically to ingest contracts. We&#8217;ve actually created an algorithm around how [you] actually write a good data protection agreement. We&#8217;ve extracted those relevant provisions and we will compare that against [your] operational reality. So if there&#8217;s a disconnect, we will be able to raise that as an intelligent insight of a data misalignment,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With 32 employees, the co-founders hope to double or perhaps even triple that number in the next 12-18 months. Golchehreh and Sharma are a diverse co-founder team and they are attempting to build a company that reflects that. They believe being remote-first gives them a leg up in this regard, but they also have internal policies to drive it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recruiters we work with have a mandate internally to say, &#8216;Hey, we really want to hire good people and diverse people.&#8217; Relyance as a company is the genesis of two individuals from two completely different ends of the spectrum coming together. And I think hopefully, we can do our job of relaying that into the company as we scale,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>The two founders have been friends for several years and began talking about forming a company together in 2019 over a pizza dinner. The idea began to gel and they launched the company in February 2020. They spent some time talking to compliance pros to understand their requirements better, then in July 2020 began building the solution they have today. They released a beta in February and began quietly selling it in March.</p>
<p>Today they have a number of early customers working with their software, including Dialpad, Patreon, Samsara and True.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>At Burning Man a few years ago, I was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for smoking marijuana in public (in my car) and driving under the influence. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I currently have a green card and want to apply for U.S. citizenship next year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I? If so, how should I handle my criminal record?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Remorseful About the Reefer</strong></p>
<p>Dear Remorseful,</p>
<p>As you’ve discovered, you have to be extra careful when you’re an immigrant: Obviously, you should never break the law, but as an immigrant, if you do, it can have severe and lasting consequences.</p>
<p>You even need to be careful to avoid doing things that an immigration officer might consider to be outside the bounds of good moral character, even if they are not crimes. All immigrants should remember that even though limited use of marijuana for recreational and medical uses is legal in several states, it’s <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/marijuana-hurts-your-immigration-citizenship-chances/">illegal under federal law</a>.</p>
<p>My law partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, recently <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/088-should-i-apply-for-citizenship-if-i-have-a-record/">podcasted</a> on how various crimes can impact your green card status and affect your ability to become a U.S. citizen. Take a listen and (always in this situation) consult an experienced immigration attorney. Tell your attorney about your DUI and marijuana charges, any subsequent marijuana use, any other arrests or citations, and even things you might consider minor such as speeding, parking or jaywalking tickets. An immigration attorney can determine whether you should proceed with applying for U.S. citizenship and if so, when and how to do so.</p>

<h2>What is good moral character?</h2>
<p>As you know, you must be a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least five years — or three years if you have a green card through marriage — to be eligible to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/035-becoming-a-u-s-citizen-naturalization-and-citizenship/">U.S. citizenship</a>. Additionally, you must demonstrate “good moral character” during the five- or three-year statutory period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, a corporate spend management startup, announced this morning that it now supports subsidiaries in different countries for U.S.-based businesses. As more companies lean into remote work, and a great many startups are founding themselves on multiple continents, the new capability could boost Airbase&#8217;s effective total addressable market.</p>
<p>The product news is interesting, but more so when we consider Airbase&#8217;s feature decisions in the larger context of the corporate spend management space itself. Startups competing in the market offer customers corporate cards and a software suite to help them manage spend more generally, along with other functionality that varies based on the provider in question.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">spilled much ink in recent months</a> tracking Airbase competitors Ramp and Brex, for example, as they raise capital and look to differentiate their products to better serve their target markets. They are doing so by both pricing decisions and feature choices.</p>

<p>Airbase, while perhaps less well-known than its rivals, was early to the decision to charge for its software in addition to deriving interchange revenues from its business. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">added a paid package of software</a> at an SMB-friendly price point. Ramp is sticking to its zero-cost guns for now.</p>
<p>Now with support for international subsidiaries and currencies for U.S.-based companies, Airbase is executing against its vision to provide spend management services for companies from inception through IPO, founder and CEO Thejo Kote told TechCrunch an interview.</p>
<p>In more detailed terms, Airbase supports payouts to some 200 countries, as well as support for moving money around more generally in a more constrained geographic area.</p>
<p>The product news fits into Airbase&#8217;s goal of supporting companies even as they scale. Other competitors in its market have a greater SMB focus, it appears. Not that that is a diss; offering corporate spend services as a free package has proven lucrative for some companies looking to onboard a host of smaller enterprises. Divvy did so and sold for more than $1 billion. And Ramp and Brex are pricing their services to be well within the reaches of smaller firms.</p>

<p>Airbase does offer a free tier, but more as a method of attracting customers that could scale into large accounts in time, it explained. Those larger accounts are the startup&#8217;s goal. Kote said during a conversation that his company now has a number of customers paying six figures per year for its software, a change from when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/">raised $60 million earlier this year,</a> when such account sizes were rarer.</p>
<p>By adding more capabilities for multinational companies, Airbase may be able to land more large customers, which, in turn, would generate both software and interchange incomes for the startup.</p>
<p>Kote also disclosed new growth metrics for Airbase, though in relative instead of absolute terms. The startup has scaled annual recurring revenue &#8212; a metric that calculates annualized subscription software sales at a company &#8212; by 3.5x in the last 12 months, he said, and 2x in the last half-year. Kote also disclosed that his company is &#8220;approaching&#8221; $2 billion in annualized payment volume through its service, up 5x in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Now in the process of digesting its Series B, Airbase has graduated from baby startup metrics, and we&#8217;ll expect something a bit harder the next time we cover the company.</p>
<p>Still, as Airbase looks to support larger companies longer, we&#8217;re seeing an interesting divergence between the corporate spend startups battling for North American market share. With three major players charging nothing, a little and a lot, it isn&#8217;t hard to guess where each will focus their product efforts in customer terms.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest problems in the world of e-commerce is the predicament of shopping cart abandonment: when shoppers aren&#8217;t getting to what they want fast enough &#8212; whether it&#8217;s finding the right item, or paying for it in a quick and easy way &#8212; they bounce. That singular problem is driving a wave of technology development to make the experience ever more seamless, and today one of the companies closely involved in that space is announcing some funding on the back of healthy growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://Constructor.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constructor</a>, which has built technology that powers search and product discovery tools for e-commerce businesses, has picked up $55 million in a Series A round of funding. Constructor says that it powers &#8220;billions&#8221; of queries every month, with revenues growing 233% in the last year. Customers it works with include Sephora, Walmart&#8217;s Bonobos, Backcountry and many other big names.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Silversmith Capital Partners &#8212; which coincidentally, just today, led another round for an e-commerce startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/zonos-banks-69m-to-develop-apis-for-democratizing-cross-border-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zonos</a>.</p>
<p>It is joined by a long list of notable individual investors. They include David Fraga, former president of InVision; Kevin Weil, former head of product at Twitter and Instagram; Jason Finger, founder of Seamless; Carl Sparks, ex-CEO of Travelocity; Robyn Peterson, CTO at CNN; Dave Heath, founder of Bombas; Ryan Barretto, president at Sprout Social; Melody Hildebrandt, EVP engineering and CISO at FOX; Zander Rafael, co-founder of Better.com; and Seth Shaw, CRO at Airtable. Cap Table Coalition &#8212; a firm that helps underrepresented background investors back up-and-coming startups &#8212; was also involved. Fraga is joining Constructor&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>The last year and a half has been a bumper one for the world of e-commerce &#8212; with more traffic, transactions and retailers moving online in the wake of social distancing measures impacting in-person, physical shopping. But that has also exposed a lot of the cracks in how e-commerce works (or doesn&#8217;t work, as the case may be).</p>
<p>One of the more dysfunctional areas is search and discovery. As most of us have unfortunately learned firsthand, when we search for things in the search window of an online store, it&#8217;s almost always the case that the results don&#8217;t have what we want.</p>
<p>When we browse as we might in a physical store, because we are not sure of what we want, all too often we are not prompted with pictures of things we might actually like to buy. They may be there &#8212; we typically visit sites because we either already know them, or have seen something we like elsewhere &#8212; but nevertheless, finding what we might actually like to buy can take a lot of time, and in many cases may never happen at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli Finkelshteyn, Constructor&#8217;s CEO and founder, says that one of the issues is that search and discovery are often built as static experiences: they are designed to meet a one-size-fits-all model where site architects have effectively guessed at what a shopper might want, and built for that. This is one area that Constructor has rethought, specifically by making search and discovery more dynamic and responsive to what&#8217;s happened before you ever visit a site.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things wrong with product discovery was that prescriptively sites show you what they think is valuable to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think the process should be descriptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example, he talked about Cheetos. Sometimes people who might want to buy these start out by navigating to the potato chip category. In many static searches, those results might not include Cheetos. Some people might abandon their search altogether (bounce), but some might navigate away from that and search specifically for Cheetos and add them to their carts. In a descriptive and more dynamic environment, Finkelshteyn believes that these two flows should subsequently inform all future chip searches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take into account as much data as we can learn from, and that list is always growing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The goal is anything we can learn from should become part of the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is the current, undisputed leader in the world of search, and it too uses a lot of dynamic, AI-based tools to learn and tweak how it searches and what results it produces.</p>
<p>Interestingly it hasn&#8217;t extended as much of this to third parties as you might think. The company <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-shutting-down-site-search-service-moving-customers-to-cse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wound down its own site search product in 2017</a> and now if you look for this you are redirected to the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/cloud-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s enterprise search suite</a>.</p>
<p>There are, however, others that have also stepped into that void to provide services that compete with Constructor, including the likes of Algolia, Yext, Elasticsearch and more. Finkelshteyn believes that among all of these, none have managed yet to provide a service like Constructor&#8217;s that learns and adjusts its results constantly based on search and browsing activity.</p>
<p>This is one reason the company has stood out with its customers, and with investors.</p>
<p>“Constructor has built a search and discovery platform that is truly making a difference for enterprise retailers. They are providing customers with comprehensive and optimized search and discovery that is unmatched in the market,” said Sri Rao, Constructor board member and general partner at Silversmith Capital Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with the Constructor team as they continue to revolutionize search and discovery capabilities for retailers across all platforms.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, there will be some interesting opportunities ahead for Constructor to take its search and discovery tools to new frontiers. These could include ways to bring in and account for shoppers on third-party platforms &#8212; currently Constructor does not power experiences on, say, social media, so that is one potential area to explore &#8212; as well as more offline experiences, critical as retailers and shoppers take on more blended approaches that might start online and finish in stores, or proceed the other way around, or find users walking around with their phones to shop even as they are in physical stores.</p>
