										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> officially spun out its infrastructure services into a new business called <a href="http://kyndryl.com">Kyndryl</a>, one that, by the way, has revenue of $19 billion out of the gate as a public company. Whatever you think of this move, Kyndryl is a substantial company, yet IBM still saw itself better off without this considerable chunk of business.</p>
<p>According to an investor presentation provided by the nascent company, Kyndryl sees itself as a consulting arm for legacy companies to help them make the transition to more modern ways of doing business, a mission that would seem to fit with what IBM has been trying to do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">in recent years</a> with the company in general.</p>
<p>But when Big Blue announced its intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spin out this division</a> last year, it was clear that it was looking to move away from legacy business, and it saw infrastructure services as a piece that didn&#8217;t fit with CEO Arvind Krishna&#8217;s hybrid and AI-focused vision. As I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">in an analysis</a> of the move when it was announced:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>You don’t need to be a financial genius to see where the company is headed. Krishna clearly saw that it was time to start moving on from the legacy side of IBM’s business, even if there would be some short-term pain involved in doing so. So the executive put his resources into (as they say) where the puck is going. Today’s news is a continuation of that effort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategies believes both companies will ultimately benefit from the separation. &#8220;IBM was one of the last companies to spin out its lower-margin, lower innovation services companies. I think IBM will benefit most from [the shift in] focus in that it doesn&#8217;t require any more executive time [on this division] and it can now focus on growth areas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regarding Kyndryl, he says the newly formed company can begin to pick and choose where it wants to concentrate from a business perspective with more freedom than it could under the IBM umbrella. &#8220;Kyndryl can be more successful on its own as it can spend money on R&amp;D like automation that actually benefits [the business]. Mature businesses require a different kind of investment,&#8221; he said, and as a separate company it can begin making those kinds of key decisions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Red Hat continues to grow, but IBM&#8217;s struggles continue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/red-hat-continues-to-grow-but-ibms-struggles-continue/embed/#?secret=J79kD6WnKu" data-secret="J79kD6WnKu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, points out that since Kyndryl starts off with a big head start in the market. &#8220;[Spinning out Kyndryl] is a key move for IBM to find growth again and to be more profitable going forward which drives valuation. Kyndryl now has to show it can produce results on its own, and given it has been gifted a number of long-term contracts from IBM, that should not be an issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Kyndryl will be fine for the short term at least based on its existing contracts, it remains to be seen if the company can flourish on its own in the longer term in a changing technology landscape. Regardless, IBM is free to concentrate on its new vision. and while it will probably miss the revenue initially, it should benefit in the long run from this arrangement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Has usage-based pricing gone mainstream? Out of nearly 600 SaaS companies surveyed, 45% said they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Has usage-based pricing (UBP) gone mainstream? That&#8217;s the case OpenView, a Boston-based VC firm, makes in its annual <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/">Financial and Operating Benchmarks survey</a>. Out of the nearly 600 SaaS companies which responded, 45% say they are using this flexible pricing model, up from 34% in 2020.</p>
<p>The report, though, isn&#8217;t just about measuring how many companies adopt a trend that OpenView <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">has been cheering for</a>. It also looks into how these companies perform compared to their counterparts, and how it impacts them more broadly. And since it doesn&#8217;t shy away from mentioning challenges, we found it particularly relevant reading for founders who might still be on the fence.</p>
<p>We talked to OpenView operating partner <a href="https://twitter.com/poyark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Poyar</a>, who co-authored the firm&#8217;s 2021 State of Usage-Based Pricing Report with partner <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanjiv Kalevar</a>. The main insights are below, but before anything else, let&#8217;s note that the report&#8217;s definition of usage-based pricing adoption includes companies like Twilio, whose pricing is almost entirely pay-as-you-go,as well as those offering usage-based subscription tiers, like Zapier.</p>
<p>In other words, the report&#8217;s co-authors don&#8217;t draw the line at whether or not there&#8217;s a subscription element, but at whether or not pricing is tied to product consumption behavior. And while companies sometimes charge based on company size, functionality, services, or other factors, this is more blatantly opposed to seat-based pricing.</p>
<h2>Momentum behind the shift</h2>
<p>According to OpenView, one of the factors driving this shift is that &#8220;seats&#8221; often make less sense than they used to. Referring to the growing number of startups whose solutions revolve around automation, AI or APIs, Poyar noted that &#8220;in none of those cases does the value a customer receives tie directly to how many individual humans are logging in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it might even be negatively correlated: when AI can automate tasks, the more successful the solution is, the fewer people need to be logging in. So seats are just an outdated way of charging, and don&#8217;t allow a company to either communicate value or invest in features that would add more value.&#8221; While Poyar admitted that &#8220;it&#8217;s not every company,&#8221; he also pointed out that these types of businesses account for a large portion of public companies.</p>
<p>This might explain another shift Poyar described: many companies that go public &#8220;are calling out usage-based models and making it a focus of their S-1s or of their investor materials.&#8221; Previously, &#8220;there used to be a fear that investors would penalize them for a usage-based model, because there was a fear that it wasn&#8217;t recurring revenue, and it wasn&#8217;t predictable. [ … ] Whereas now, a usage-based revenue model is seen as a competitive advantage, and a driver of long-term growth.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hybe is one of the most successful companies manufacturing pop bands at the moment and they are riding the wave.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.quintoandar.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuintoAndar</a> is taking its first steps out of Brazil to open a technology hub in Lisbon, Portugal aimed at attracting technology talent across the pond.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gabriel Braga made the announcement at Web Summit 2021 going on this week in Lisbon. The new office will serve as its first in Europe and will be operational in March, initially staffing up to 50 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The company touts itself as “the largest housing platform in Latin America,” providing selling and rental assistance, and also takes on the risk associated with monthly rental payments. QuintoAndar currently had more than 150,000 properties and $89 billion in assets under management and operates in more than 40 cities across Brazil.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The move comes six months after the company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/quintoandar-raises-300m-at-a-4b-valuation-as-ribbit-capital-makes-a-big-bet-on-the-brazilian-proptech/">$300 million in Series E funding</a> that valued the company at $4 billion. In August, investors Tencent and Greenoaks added another $120 million to push valuation to $5.1 billion and over $700 million raised in total, Braga said.</p>
<p>He noted that the European region is home to a lot of technology talent, and the tech hub was something that had been in the works for awhile, but was postponed due to the global pandemic. Now that the company has embraced a hybrid work model, it is ready to take the step to expand internationally.</p>
<p>In addition to the presence in Portugal, QuintoAndar is also preparing to make a similar move to Mexico next year, Brag said.</p>
<p>“The new office is part of our long-term focus of building a world-class tech team and part of the funding will support that continuous investment,” he added. “We are based in Brazil, but more and more, we are bringing on people from all over the world to join us. Remote work made it easier in some ways and hard in others, but now we have more people spread out.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Nintendo just dropped the update to version 2.0 &#8211; a day early.</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo announced the biggest update yet for its biggest Switch game of 2020, which was slated to arrive November 5. As of now, the “Happy Home Paradise” DLC hasn’t yet been added to the game, but there’s still plenty to do with the free patch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/animal-crossing-new-horizons-will-get-major-updates-and-happy-home-paradise-dlc-on-november-5/">new features</a> include the Roost cafe, farming and cooking DIY recipes (step aside, &#8220;Stardew Valley&#8221;), boat rides to rare islands with Kapp&#8217;n, gyroid hunting, makeovers and shopping with Harriet on Harv&#8217;s island, and more. The update also includes quality-of-life improvements, including extra home storage and storage sheds that you can place around your island, so you don&#8217;t have to run to your home every time you want to deposit items. There&#8217;s also now more capacity for ramps and bridges on your island, new camera modes (perfect for anyone who got way too into &#8220;New Pokémon Snap&#8221;), and even a motion-controlled stretching exercise that you can do with your villagers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228943" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>After downloading the update, Isabelle will explain ordinances and boat tours with Kapp&#8217;n in her daily update. With the ability to enact island ordinances, players can change what time of day villagers are most active. This can be helpful for gamers whose real-life schedules only allow them to play at certain times, since villagers act differently throughout the day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately boat rides with Kapp&#8217;n can only be purchased once per day with Nook Miles, so you can&#8217;t endlessly cycle through islands like you can when you depart from the airport. But maybe this is Nintendo&#8217;s way of encouraging us to play the game in moderation, rather than speeding to 400 hours and burning out within months, never to touch the game again until the next update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employees of Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of General Motors, will be the first to jump inside one of the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicles that operate in San Francisco without a human driver in the front seat. Certain members of the public will also be able to ride, but they won&#8217;t be charged a fare.</p>
<p>Cruise co-founder, CTO and president Kyle Vogt was reportedly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmvZBiWYkFQ&amp;ab_channel=Cruise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first to ride</a> the driverless AV, and he gushed about it all over Twitter.</p>

<p>&mdash; Kyle Vogt (@kvogt) <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Around 11pm Monday night we launched an AV without anyone inside for the first time,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992698242953219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted Vogt</a>. &#8220;Until now we&#8217;ve been testing with humans in the driver&#8217;s or passenger&#8217;s seat, so this was a first. It began to roam around the city, waiting for a ride request. At 11:20pm I used the Cruise app and summoned my first ride. After a few minutes, one of the Cruise AVs (named Sourdough) drove up to me and pulled over. Nobody was inside the car. I pressed the &#8216;start ride&#8217; button and the AV smoothly pulled back into traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vogt also said he requested five more rides that night. The rides had to be at night because according to the stipulations of Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;driverless deployment permit&#8221; from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the company can only operate driverless between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m and at a max speed of 30 miles per hour. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received the permit in early October,</a> which allows the company to deploy its vehicles without a human onboard, as well as charge fees for delivery services, but crucially not ride-hailing services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s first human-less deployment comes about a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/self-driving-company-cruise-on-track-for-early-commercial-operations-in-2022/">GM CEO Mary Barra said the company is confident</a> that Cruise will begin commercial driverless ride-hailing and delivery operations by next year. Cruise has yet to apply for the final permit it needs, which would be from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), to be able to charge for robotaxi services. Until such time, only Cruise employees and non-paying members of the public will be riding around in Sourdough and other human-less AVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving trucks startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/tusimple-overseas-roadblocks/">TuSimple</a> signaled it is close to testing its system without a human safety operator on public roads before the end of the year. During the startup&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, TuSimple announced plans to proceed with its driver-out pilot program, which would remove the driver for runs over the 80-mile route between the Phoenix and Tucson areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to perform the initial driver runs before year end and to complete the pro pilot program over the coming months,&#8221; Cheng Lu, TuSimple&#8217;s president and CEO, said during the call. &#8220;As a reminder, the driver-out pilot will consist of multiple runs performed over multiple weeks and is a major part of ongoing technology development across many dimensions, including software, hardware and go-to-market. What makes the driver-out pilot program so challenging is that we&#8217;re solving for both known and unknown factors that we might encounter on public roads. This includes noncompliant motors, unplanned road construction and changing driving conditions, all of which must be continuously monitored and accounted for in real time.&#8221;</p>
<p>If TuSimple can begin this program before 2022, it will put the company in one of the leading positions against the competition. Kodiak Robotics, for example, has only begun driver-out testing on closed tracks. Embark is not currently testing on public roads without a human safety driver, but is planning a pilot for 2023 and is targeting commercial driver-out operations by 2024. Waymo Via is currently not testing in &#8220;rider only&#8221; mode, but is testing with two autonomous specialists in the cab of the vehicle, one in the driver&#8217;s seat and the other acting as a software technician. Swedish freight company Einride, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/einride-launches-autonomous-pods-and-electric-freight-operations-in-u-s/">just launched its U.S. operations</a>, has been driverless in Europe for a couple of years now, but will only be operating without a human driver in the U.S. at its partner GE Appliances&#8217; closed campus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228823" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the coming weeks, we expect to &#8216;freeze&#8217; our technology development so it can be used in final test runs on open roads with a safety driver and on a test track with no human inside the vehicle,&#8221; according to TuSimple&#8217;s earnings report. &#8220;This test phase will inform and validate our safety case. After we fully complete the safety validation process, our team will then be able to proceed with removing the driver from the vehicle for our 80-mile run on public roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, TuSimple thinks its tech is ready to perform fully autonomously, at least on a specific stretch of road, and will spend the next few weeks building out its safety case. The company outlined two primary areas for its driver-out safety case validation: &#8220;Systems safety&#8221; and &#8220;operations safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Systems safety validates that the trucks are safe to operate autonomously by helping each aspect of the system to be reliable, fail-safe, sufficient and proven, said Lu. Operations safety &#8220;supports each aspect of our driver operations to be prepared and proven by creating safe processes and procedures,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;Operation Safety validates that we have monitored and triaged every driving event that we can, assessed the event&#8217;s level of safety risk and assigned it for resolution by engineering teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the pilot, TuSimple does face some challenges in the Tier 1 supply chain to moving past the driver-out tests and actually putting more vehicles on the road. In the near term, Lu pointed to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. In the long term, the challenge TuSimple sees to the scale deployment of autonomous technology is supply chain maturity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That really revolves around key Tier 1 components like the compute, autonomous Domain Controller (ADC), or redundant actuation, steering and braking,&#8221; said Lu. &#8220;And so there&#8217;s a little chicken-and-egg that happens in this because Tier 1s don&#8217;t want to commit to investments without orders, and that&#8217;s something that we have identified as one of the risks and so we are taking steps to address that&#8230; Over the next coming quarters, you&#8217;ll hear more announcements from us in terms of investing more heavily in the supply chain to ensure that we can meet the timeline that we talked about.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Q3, TuSimple spent $85 million on R&amp;D, which is up $24 million, or around 3x, year-over-year, and a large chunk of that was related to hiring tech talent and additional drivers. Adding more personnel, as well as increasing the commercial utilization of its fleet and autonomous freight network (AFN) partner fleets, is what TuSimple credits as the reason it was able to beat revenue expectations of $1.65 million with a Q3 revenue of $1.8 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to recruit new drivers and acquire new trucks for our fleet continues to be our most significant source of headwinds to revenue growth, but we have been able to navigate this environment and are on track to achieve our full year revenue guidance of $5 to $7 million,&#8221; according to the earnings report.</p>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s net loss per share, at $0.54, was greater than the expected $0.49. However, the startup increased its revenue mile growth by 2.5x from Q3 last year, coming in at around 945,000 miles, which is up from around 379,000, but quarter-over-quarter is a lot less impressive &#8212; in the second quarter, TuSimple drove around 880,000 revenue miles, which means there&#8217;s only a 7% increase.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, TuSimple also said it is mapping new freight lanes with UPS from Arizona, where the company has performed most of its operations, all the way to Florida. The company plans to expand its AFN across the United States by 2024, and recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">partnered with freight management company Ryder</a> to help achieve that end. Now, TuSimple is collaborating with UPS Supply Chain Solutions to expand its AFN ahead of schedule to the east coast to reach UPS North America Air Freight (NAAF) terminals in Orlando and Charlotte, where the company has already high-def mapped routes.</p>
<p>Since 2019, when TuSimple&#8217;s partnership with UPS began, the company has completed 160,000 miles of freight hauls for NAAF and says it saved the company 13% on fuel at speeds between 55 miles and 68 miles per hour. In Q3, when the company expanded its AFN from Dallas to Charlotte, it mapped 1,400 new unique miles, bringing total unique miles mapped to 9,900. TuSimple said it expects map quality to continuously improve due to new mapping tech that is refined for dynamic, low-latency updates, reducing update times from weeks to days and, over the long term, to minutes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s head of software engineering Craig Federighi took his time onstage at the <a href="https://websummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Summit 2021</a> conference to air a laundry list of grievances against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed requirements</a> for sideloading apps onto iPhones, describing the practice as &#8220;gold rush for the malware industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter for discussion not simply because there is lively debate on the topic (though there is), but because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">the EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act</a>, if implemented as currently laid out, could mandate a method of putting apps on iPhones that circumvents Apple&#8217;s longstanding App Store and review process.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Cook already made the company&#8217;s position (hard against this, obviously) known in June, when he said the rule could &#8220;destroy the security of the iPhone.&#8221; So it&#8217;s not a big surprise that Federighi would back up the boss, but dedicating pretty much <a href="https://youtu.be/iwstKnhWs6k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a full onstage speech</a> to a series of arguably misleading and totally unchallenged assertions offers the viewer light notes of desperation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s approach of manually reviewing each app and update has its own problems, but for the purposes of preventing malware it&#8217;s a pretty good solution — that much is fair to say. But it&#8217;s one thing to say your method is better, another entirely to say that other methods should never, ever be allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a clear consensus here, and it&#8217;s that sideloading undermines security and puts people&#8217;s data at risk,&#8221; he said. That may very well be true, but it&#8217;s not the only consensus. There&#8217;s also something of a consensus among developers and users — to say nothing of antitrust authorities — that Apple has exerted a stranglehold on the iOS app market that long ago became more of a hindrance than an asset to the global market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to provide people with a choice of what we view as the best,&#8221; Federighi said, shortly before embarking on a tirade against certain choices. In his view, offering users the choice to sideload apps &#8220;would take away consumers&#8217; choice of a more secure platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>More choice is less choice, got it! He then hurried on to a rather labored metaphor he hoped would resonate with the homeowners in the crowd. Let&#8217;s just quote the whole thing here:</p>
<blockquote><p>You made a choice. You wanted to protect your family so you bought a really safe home with a really great security system. And you&#8217;re really glad you did. Because since you first moved in the burglars have never been more creative or more plentiful. And in the real world of cybersecurity, this couldn&#8217;t be more true. Attackers are virtually dressing up as mailmen building tunnels underground and trying to scale your backyard walls with grappling hooks. In this world, some of your neighbors are suffering repeated break ins, but the home you have has kept you safe.</p>
<p>But then, that new law gets passed. And in the noble pursuit of a more optimized package delivery, your town requires everyone to build an always-unlocked side door on the ground floor of their homes. Now some of your neighbors, they love this idea. But you&#8217;re not so sure, because you know that once a side door is built, anyone can walk through it. The safe house that you chose now has a fatal flaw in its security system, and burglars are really good at exploiting it. In a nutshell, sideloading is that unlocked side door and requiring it on iPhone would give cybercriminals an easy point of entry into your device. Now, we don&#8217;t think anyone wants that, least of all the policy makers intending to give users more choice and more protections.</p>
<p>Instead of creating choice it would open up a Pandora&#8217;s box of unreviewed malware ridden software and deny everyone the option of iPhone secure approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>This imagery, however vivid, falls somewhat short of the reality. The choice to have and use that door will very much be up to the users, and Apple has a responsibility and opportunity to explain the risks of that choice very clearly. Google hasn&#8217;t succeeded in some ways there, Federighi pointed out, but that sounds like something Apple could just improve on. Most users will have no need or desire to sideload apps, and even if they do, the idea is not to create a wild west — which, by the way, most computers have been for a long time — but to create space in the market for competition.</p>

<p>If we go back to our &#8220;favorite house&#8221; as he called it, it&#8217;s worth noting that Federighi failed to mention that that big secure front door has a special apple-shaped hole through which only Apple-branded packages can be delivered. This isn&#8217;t about just putting another hole in the house, it&#8217;s about having literally any alternative to a system — an effective system, but a relic from another age — that has been the only option for a decade and made the already rich company running it one of the richest in history.</p>
<p>There was quite a bit of fearmongering and FUD to go along with the half-truths Federighi was peddling onstage. Perhaps not the inspiring speech the audience was expecting from someone so influential in tech.</p>
<p>They may only be delaying the inevitable, but clearly Apple will fight tooth and nail for the consumer&#8217;s right to choose what Apple has already chosen for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fisker provided an upbeat forecast on the ramp-up of its electric automaking business during Wednesday&#8217;s third-quarter earnings call, highlighting its manufacturing partnership with Foxconn, a battery supply agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL secured and its on-track production for the company’s debut Ocean SUV.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will start production of the Ocean in November 2022, in partnership with automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr, and will produce two vehicles a day by the first quarter of next year, CEO Henrik Fisker said during an investor call Wednesday. Deliveries are on track to begin in the U.S. and Europe in late 2022.</p>
<p>To meet these deadlines, Fisker is ramping up its pace of spending. While its general and administrative expenses rose a modest few million dollars to $10.3 million in the most recent quarter (up from $7.9 million in the three months concluded June 30, 2021), other expenses rose more rapidly. The critical research and development line item from Fisker &#8212; recall that the company is still getting <i>ready</i> to build and sell cars, so it’s in R&amp;D mode today &#8212; grew by more than 100% from its Q2 2021 tally of $45.3 million to $99.3 million in the most recent quarter. The increase was the result of increasing the company&#8217;s workforce, and spending on prototype development, executives said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That incredible bounce to R&amp;D spend helps explain why Fisker added so much cash to its accounts in recent weeks; it needs a boatload of cash to get its vehicles into the market, and into the hands of their eventual drivers.</p>
<h2>Fisker and CATL</h2>
<p>The big news is Fisker’s battery deal with CATL, for which the Chinese company will supply an initial annual capacity of over 5 gigawatt-hours through 2025, with an option to increase volumes. The Fisker Ocean will launch with two different battery packs, which will go into prototypes next year: the base pack will use a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry that’s lower cost, but less energy dense; the second battery, a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), will have higher energy density with greater range, but will have a commensurate cost increase to go along with it.</p>
<p>“What this allows us to do is get the world’s longest range in our segment for an SUV in our price class,” Fisker said. More details on the range of the two battery packs will be revealed at the LA Auto Show next week, he added. LFP, an older battery chemistry, has become a popular lower-cost option amongst companies, including Tesla, which said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-earnings-iron-batteries-evs-globally/">it would use the chemistry</a> in all standard Model 3 vehicles across global markets.</p>
<p>“Why would we be ahead of the competition?” he said. “We chose all this technology this year. So when you get a Fisker Ocean 12 months from now, your technology is the newest of the newest. If you buy any other car next year, most likely that technology was chosen three years ago.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also in the middle of setting up a Chinese entity to take reservations from customers in that country, though that likely won&#8217;t be complete before the beginning of next year, Fisker said. Around 80-85% of Fisker&#8217;s current reservations come from the U.S.</p>
<h2>Earnings results</h2>
<p>Now, onto the earnings. Obviously, as a pre-revenue company, what matters on Fisker&#8217;s earnings is a little different from our usual financial fare. Shares of Fisker are up just over 1% in after-hours trading after the electric vehicle company announced its third-quarter performance. As expected, the company’s revenues were more than light, and Fisker lost money.</p>
<p>The market had expected Fisker to report a per-share loss of $0.35. The company’s $0.37 loss per share was worth some $109.8 million, in net loss terms. Fisker generated a bare $15,000 in revenue during the period, a figure that led to a $1,000 net loss.</p>
<p>Fisker was also pipped to detail a recent bond offering that brought its cash supply up to $1.40 billion, a huge fain from its preceding tally of $962 million, a figure shared at the end of its June 30, 2021 quarter. Fisker sold $667.5 million worth of convertible notes yielding 2.5%, helping it sell its coffers ahead of eventual vehicle production.</p>
<p>While Fisker remains pre-revenue today, investors expect that to rapidly change. From a faint dusting of top-line in 2021, street analysts anticipate that the company will soar to $264.2 million in revenues during the 2022 period, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSR/analysis?p=FSR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Yahoo Finance data</a>. All that cash that Fisker just raised will come in handy when it has to meet those essentially infinitely steeper revenue demands from public-market investors.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 3, 2021. What a day! Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a slowdown to its bond-buying program, stocks went up again. It’s heads-you-win, tails-you&#8217;re-still-in stock market lately. Economy not good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on a comfortable central-banking environment. Economy good enough for tightening? Stocks go up on good economic news. Sure. I suppose it’s good news for startups looking to exit. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/egypts-breadfast-wants-to-build-gopuff-for-africa-and-middle-east-gets-26m-backing/"><strong>The Gopuff model goes international:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As TechCrunch notes, rapid, on-demand delivery is big business around the world today, and Breadfast wants to own the model in Egypt and across Africa. The company started life as a bread delivery firm but has since branched out. And it just raised $26 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/"><strong>U.S. bans NSO Group:</strong></a> Software made by NSO group has been used by authoritarian governments to snoop on journalists, dissidents and other folks that the powerful do not like. The U.S. Commerce Department just added NSO to its Entity List, shuttering trade with the firm in the States. Progress.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/"><strong>Australia says facial recognition startup broke its laws:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Also from the security beat is news from Down Under, namely that Clearview AI “broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens’ facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service.” Canada has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">come to a similar conclusion</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/spartan-radar/"><strong>Radar or lidar?</strong></a> A new funding round for Spartan Radar — coming in rapid succession after a preceding investment — indicates that the market has yet to determine which tech will lead the way for self-driving cars.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/ethyca-fides-privacy-codebase/"><strong>Ethyca wants to help developers write privacy-forward software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Fresh with new funds, Ethyca is making its Fides set of tooling open source so that “developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases.” In the wake of the above privacy news, it feels like a pretty good day for consumers. At least directionally, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/e-commerce-aggregator-una-brands-raises-15m-series-a-five-months-after-its-launch/"><strong>Yet more money for e-commerce rollups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The push to consolidate e-commerce brands is a global affair.

First, African fintech has been on a fundraising tear lately, so we’re not surprised to see more activity from the sector. Second, Payhippo’s model is focused on SMB lending, which we dig. And, third, Payhippo is a great startup name.</li>
<li>To round out our startup coverage today, an essay from Victoria Pettibone, a managing partner at Astia Fund, arguing that “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/vcs-must-do-a-better-job-of-supporting-black-women-founders/">VCs must do a better job of supporting Black women founders</a>.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Female founders are making a buzzing, venture-backed comeback</h2>
<p>We are nowhere near achieving parity or representation when it comes to startup funding, but the gender gap is narrowing, according to PitchBook data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Funding for U.S.-based, female-founded startups nearly doubled in the last year: So far in 2021, women-led companies have closed 2,661 deals worth $40.4 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped,&#8221; report Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;Indeed, it has shot the other direction.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is preparing for a world where your driver profile can follow you across different cars, be it your personal EV or a rental. The car maker has added a Cloud Profiles section in its latest software release, which points to an &#8220;Enable Vehicle Sync&#8221; option for backing up driver profiles, <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/626/exclusive-tesla-adding-vehicle-sync-feature-to-driver-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates reports</em></a>. The news isn&#8217;t a huge surprise, as Elon Musk previously said <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/upcoming-features/id/72/tesla-to-add-driver-profiles-to-the-cloud-giving-you-the-ability-to-use-your-profile-on-any-vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">cloud-synced profiles</a> were on the way.</p>
<p>For a tech-focused car company like Tesla, giving its customers a simple way to bring their settings to multiple vehicles simply makes sense. That&#8217;s particularly true after Hertz announced it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">would be buying 100,000 Teslas</a> for its rental fleet. Though Musk was quick to point out that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">order hasn&#8217;t been placed yet</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to imagine a world where anyone can easily rent a Tesla. They&#8217;d be easier to maintain than gas-powered cars, and the Model 3 is already cheaper than many luxury vehicles.</p>
<p>And sure, for the truly privileged, cloud profiles could also make it easier to synchronize settings across multiple vehicles. According to <em>Tesla Software Updates</em>, synced settings include your display brightness, Autopilot and navigation options. It&#8217;d also be helpful to have your Stopping Mode synchronized, as that seriously changes how Tesla&#8217;s braking functions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228840" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has been steadily updating its rebuilt API following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">mid-2020 relaunch</a>. Most recently, the company added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/twitter-adds-support-for-twitter-spaces-to-its-rebuilt-api/">support for Twitter Spaces</a> to its developer platform. Today, it&#8217;s <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-manage-tweets-endpoints-for-the-twitter-api-v2/161501">announcing</a> support that will enable developers to build better Twitter bots by launching new end points that allow you to tweet, delete tweets, post polls, use Reply settings and tag people in images. It also now supports Super Follows functionality, so developers can build out solutions to support creators, the company says.</p>
<p>While bots that post spam are unwanted, Twitter has made it clear that it sees other bots as being helpful. The company in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-introduces-a-new-label-that-allows-the-good-bots-to-identify-themselves/">introduced</a> a new label that would allow what it calls the &#8220;good bots&#8221; to properly identify themselves on the platform, for example.</p>
<p>At the time, it cited examples of good bots including the public service account <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5WDq6vi7Y7nVk5ty0x9z5Bg2PwA">@earthquakesSF</a>; a bot offering COVID-19 updates called <a href="https://twitter.com/vax_progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/vax_progress&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvakD6bj-U6vi7AnMeJNzkf0WuA">@vax_progress</a>; a bot that offers an ongoing breakdown of the last 100 bills introduced in Congress, <a href="https://twitter.com/last100bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/last100bills&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5V_BHVBuBJqzqui6U6migBp8Elg">@last100bills</a>; an accessibility-focused bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQy3thJB3m9OxdwEEf_Nbu4gbPvA">@AltTxtReminder</a>; and others that just add value in their own way, like <a href="https://twitter.com/met_drawings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/met_drawings&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELU1MqaEpv-GENvi0GFP3oTDDFFA">@met_drawings</a>, which shares public domain works from The Met’s Drawings and Prints department, or the goofy <a href="https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGchDl4BjnSSP1Pt0bbcP4ufPqh3A">@EmojiMashupBot</a>, among others.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Twitter again touts the @vaxprogress bot and its developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield">Brian Moore</a>, who&#8217;s also behind bots like <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTIMESALLCAPS">@NYTIMESALLCAPS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chernobylstatus">@chernobylstatus</a>, and who will become an early adopter of the new Twitter API v2 features, he says.</p>
<p>While things like polls and image tagging will make tweets more interactive, Twitter&#8217;s new &#8220;manage tweets&#8221; end points will allow for more basic functionality &#8212; like posting tweets or deleting tweets for an authenticated account. This could enable more Twitter cleanup solutions, perhaps, like those that remove old tweets on behalf of their users or solutions that post automatic updates, like the above bots, for instance.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting features that will allow developers to post tweets and do more in terms of how those tweets operate or what they include, the company is also expanding the new API to support its creator platform, Super Follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Launched publicly</a> in September, Super Follows allow users to support their favorite creators on the platform by subscribing to their exclusive content, like member-only tweets and newsletters, for instance. Fans may also gain access to private communities, deals, discounts or other membership perks and receive a supporter badge depending on how the creator sets up their Super Follow membership program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the API changes, Twitter is adding the ability to share tweets to Super Followers via the API, which would allow developers to build out solutions that help creators make money from their Twitter fan base. While today Super Follows is still limited to only a select number of creators, the audience for this functionality isn&#8217;t yet large. But Twitter has its eye on the future here, thinking about how third-party apps aimed at creators may need to build in support for sharing content to a wide variety of platforms &#8212; Twitter among them.</p>
<p>Combined the updates allow developers to build platforms where users are able to take advantage of Twitter-native features directly &#8212; like conversation controls, polls, Super Follows and other features &#8212; much of which hasn&#8217;t been possible before. That could lead to improved third-party Twitter clients, as well.</p>
<p>Twitter said much of this new functionality was prioritized for the new API release based on community feedback, and the company asked for the feedback to continue so it can help plan what to build next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">company formerly known as Facebook</a> just announced its plans to sneak around Apple&#8217;s infamous platform fees, the latest beat in an ongoing war between major software companies and the creator of iOS. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114044739955341">Facebook post Wednesday</a>, Meta&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg said that the social network would give eligible creators on its platform new custom links that allow them to accept payments directly, circumventing Apple&#8217;s controversial 30% cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we build for the metaverse, we&#8217;re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we&#8217;re updating our Subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creators who run Facebook pages eligible for subscriptions can share the new promo links through text or email, pointing their fans to a payments portal run through its own payment system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebook-confirms-test-of-venmo-like-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments-in-u-s/">Facebook Pay</a>. In the creator post, Facebook also announced a new bonus program that gives creators between $5 and $20 for each new subscriber they sign up until the end of the year, part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">$1 billion creator program</a> the company previously announced.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228778" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228815" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228815" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2228815 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg" alt="Facebook creator link" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fb-creator-link.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228815" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Patreon-like subscriptions product gives people with popular Facebook pages access to special monetization tools for monthly recurring payments. To sign up, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/271606753455489?id=558489708108283">current eligibility rules</a> require a page owner to have 10,000 followers or more than 250 return viewers plus either 50,000 post engagements or 180,000 minutes watched.</p>
<p>Facebook has stated that it won&#8217;t be collecting any fees of its own from creator payments through 2023, though given its aggressive move into the space the company surely has plans to cash in on the booming creator economy after giving people a few introductory years rent free. The company even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/">previously planned to extract its own 30% cut</a> of subscriber earnings, though backed away from those plans — for now, at least.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m2bq6cRWEb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/">Facebook will start taking a cut of fan subscriptions in 2020</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook will start taking a cut of fan subscriptions in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/facebook-subscription-revenue-share/embed/#?secret=m2bq6cRWEb" data-secret="m2bq6cRWEb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Apple has historically extracted a standard 30% fee from all paid apps and in-app payments made through iOS — a toll that generates massive revenue for the company. Late last year Apple threw smaller app makers a bone, lowering the cut to 15% for developers who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">make under $1 million annually</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s app store fees are a major sore spot for a number of huge software developers. Last year, Fortnite maker Epic Games took the company to court over in-app fees in a flashy campaign that positioned Epic as the little guy going to bat for developers everywhere. Meta, which is worth $923 billion at the time of writing, is positioning itself similarly in the new fight over creator payments that it just picked with Apple.</p>
<p>In September, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">judge in California&#8217;s Epic Games v. Apple case ruled</a> that Apple could no longer block developers from pointing users toward external payment options that circumvent Apple&#8217;s substantial fees. That decision opened the door for Facebook&#8217;s new workaround. Apple appealed the ruling and requested a stay on the judge&#8217;s injunction last month.</p>
<p>The new workaround for creator payments isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s first major clash with Apple, nor is it the first in which Facebook maneuvered to align itself with the everyman. The company was so threatened by new anti-tracking features in iOS 14 designed to bolster user privacy that it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/"> took out full-page print ads</a> protesting the changes in every major national newspaper — ostensibly on behalf of the small businesses that would be affected and not its own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ocean is vast and mysterious … but rather less so when you have thousands of little autonomous buoys reporting back interesting info to you every day. That&#8217;s just what <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com/">Sofar Ocean</a> has, and it just raised $39 million to scale up its vision of real-time understanding of the seven seas.</p>
<p>The company operates what it calls an &#8220;ocean intelligence platform,&#8221; essentially a real-time map of various important oceanic metrics like currents, temperature, weather and so on. While some of this information is easy enough to get from satellites or the large network of shipping vessels on the water at any given time, the kind of granularity and ground truth you get from having thousands of dedicated observers riding the waves is pretty clear.</p>
<p>If you have data that&#8217;s 15 minutes old rather than yesterday&#8217;s reading or an estimate by a passing satellite, you can simply make more informed decisions about things like shipping routes, weather predictions (even on land), and of course there are the innumerable scientific applications of such a large amount of data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are, so far, if you will, some unspecified thousands of &#8220;Spotters,&#8221; as they call them, out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;One might argue this number still feels small when you think about the size of the oceans,&#8221; said CEO Tim Janssen, but it&#8217;s both more than others have accomplished and still not enough. &#8220;We’ve already got all five oceans covered, but now it’s time to kick it into even higher gear to improve the density of this distributed platform for the most powerful sensing capability possible. That’s why we anticipate rapidly adding many more sensors over the next couple of years to expand the data we collect and get even more accurate ocean insights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sofar and DARPA recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/">a hardware standard called Bristlemouth</a> intended to serve as a reference design for people designing their own ocean-going data collection devices. The idea is to make the growing autonomous presence in the water as interoperable as possible to avoid the bother of overlapping yet incompatible networks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6VjQHJP2uO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/">Sofar and DARPA look to standardize ocean monitoring gadgets with Bristlemouth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sofar and DARPA look to standardize ocean monitoring gadgets with Bristlemouth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/sofar-and-darpa-look-to-standardize-ocean-monitoring-devices-with-bristlemouth/embed/#?secret=6VjQHJP2uO" data-secret="6VjQHJP2uO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The challenges from running a network of thousands of presumably barnacle-encrusted, fish-nibbled, weather-beaten robo-buoys are what you might expect. Janssen said the Spotters require &#8220;minimal maintenance,&#8221; having been designed to survive the open ocean for long periods of time. &#8220;We recently had a Spotter that was covered in ice because of harsh weather conditions and once the ice melted months later, it automatically started sharing data again,&#8221; he recalled. If one washes up on shore they help the finder return it to where it needs to be.</p>
<p>The devices report not through manual data offloading or mesh networking (though this is an option) but through the Iridium satellite network — though Janssen said the company is &#8220;starting to lean into some of the latest technologies, like Swarm, that are revolutionizing the satellite communication space.&#8221; (Swarm, as we&#8217;ve followed since its early days, is a low-bandwidth satcom network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/swarms-low-cost-satellite-data-network-is-now-available-to-commercial-clients/">focused on IoT-type applications</a> rather than consumer internet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/">SpaceX is in the process of acquiring them</a>.)</p>

<p>The $39 million round was led by Union Square Ventures and the Foundry Group, both of which expressed (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/as-climate-change-impacts-major-industries-globally-sofar-ocean-secures-39m-series-b-to-accelerate-its-ocean-intelligence-platform-to-drive-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-301413537.html?tc=eml_cleartime">in a press release</a>) the clear need for more data in both present enterprises like shipping and future work like studying climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we’re seeing now, especially in light of COP26, is that climate change discussions are finally taking center stage as governments across the globe adjust and plan ahead for more intense hurricanes and storms, rising sea levels and threatened ecosystems like coral reefs,&#8221; Janssen explained. &#8220;Any clarity that can be provided regarding these changing weather patterns, currents and temperatures, and sensitive marine ecosystems isn’t just a win for us or our partners; it’s truly a win for each individual on this planet as we all collectively work together to beat the ticking clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>While governments think about whether they should do anything, of course, shipping and supply chain management companies are willing to pay for Sofar&#8217;s data, in the hopes of better routing, which minimizes fuel use and improves logistics generally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having access to real-time data is going to help reduce uncertainty across all these industries to be more efficient, make better business decisions, and even save fuel to reduce emissions — all to establish a more sustainable and more prepared planet,&#8221; Janssen said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Allbirds rings the bell on the Nasdaq  today and has chosen an apt ticker to do it: BIRD.</p>
<p>It started with a humble, natural wool (and extremely comfortable) shoe, but Allbirds is not merely an apparel company today. It has now become a materials innovation company disrupting how clothes are made. The company is driving change in the industry through the open sourcing of materials for others to benefit, and in doing so, is becoming the industry&#8217;s standard bearer on sustainability practices.</p>
<p>The fashion industry alone dumps <a href=" https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate">2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide</a> into the atmosphere every year. That equals twice the amount of pollution generated by every car currently in use in America. Most of what we wear on our bodies today is made from plastic. Plastic comes from oil, which comes from fossil fuels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228405" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This needs to change. And it will.</p>
<p>Allbirds is more than simply clothing their customers. It is enabling people to contribute to the possibility that their children will enjoy the lives that they did and making them feel good about it  —  through comfort, style or performance  —  and in doing so, creating a brand they don’t just align with, but love.</p>
<p>Allbirds is not alone in this vision or innovation — Tesla’s job is far greater than simply getting a driver from one place to another; Impossible Meats’ job is more than just feeding a hungry customer. The job for all these businesses is to ensure that the planet we live on not only <em>survives</em>, but thrives in the coming decades, all while giving consumers a choice to participate proactively without compromising quality of lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Sustainable companies are most likely to lead the next generation</h2>
<p>While people agree on the importance of becoming sustainable, sustainability practices are likely to take legacy players years to put in place and perfect. The consensus view underestimates and underappreciates just how hard it will be to simply catch up in a race long after it has started. This is a huge opportunity for founders to build a purpose-native company that will have generational impact on the community, for employees and investors alike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sustainability theme isn&#8217;t just restricted to consumer goods, it applies to every business. On any given day, you can find news on the funding of sustainable technology at the small end of towns (every large venture capital firm has at least one alternative meat company in their portfolio) or the ESG responsibility of large corporations.</p>
<p>According to The Economist, investors poured more than $500 billion in 2021 into “energy transition” (shorthand for decarbonizing everything from energy and transport to industry and farming), twice as much as they did in 2010. The investment required to decarbonize the planet is estimated to be more than $30 trillion, presenting people with a rare opportunity to invest in companies that will be involved in the race to net-zero carbon emissions. Climate change is the biggest investor tailwind of the century.</p>
<p>There is a perception that the current valuations of the likes of Tesla — around 16x EV/NTM revenue — compared to other car manufacturers that trade between 7x-10x earnings, or Beyond Meat, trading at around 10x forward revenue, are extremely lofty.</p>
<p>To be invested in these businesses, you need to believe that the shift is not <em>just</em> to &#8220;sustainable.&#8221; You need to believe that there is a dramatic long-term shift to where the long-term winners are those that can put their sustainable practices at the heart of every decision.</p>
<p>If you are starting a company today, it has to be &#8220;purpose native.&#8221; For these companies, their current adoption and growth rates can, and likely will, continue for far longer than any of their peers have seen because of this advantage. Sustainable-first companies have the greatest chance of becoming the next generation&#8217;s winners.</p>
<p>Will Allbirds become the next Nike and compound at ~25% for decades? I don’t know, but I do know they are much more likely to than any other early-stage challenger. Let’s hope the world does not eat itself before sustainability gets its chance to chew on some CO2.</p>
<p><em>TDM Growth Partners are invested in Allbirds.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of TechCrunch Live, Fleiss and Cheng will sit down to discuss the early days of Rent the Runway — how the company successfully fundraised, grew and navigated its way to unicorn status. They&#8217;ll also talk through the current early-stage fundraising landscape, which is nearly unrecognizable from the environment Fleiss fundraised in a decade ago. This episode takes place Wednesday, November 10, at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-volition-capital?ref=14cba39fb3ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for free here!</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by sitting down with founders and the investors who finance them to hear how they chose one another, how they tackled challenges and how successful founders quickly grow their businesses.</p>
<p>The weekly event series also features the TechCrunch Live pitch-off, which invites founders in the audience to join our virtual stage and pitch their products to the audience and our expert speakers, who give live feedback on the pitches.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is 100% free to attend, but access to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">massive library of on-demand TCL content</a> is reserved exclusively for TechCrunch+ members.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a founder of a startup on an E-2 visa. I am in the process of raising funds, which will eventually reduce my ownership of the company and prevent me from meeting the E-2 requirements. What can I consider next that would also allow my spouse to continue working?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fintech Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Fintech,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Great question! As you know, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/">E-2 visa</a> for treaty investors, essential employees and spouses requires that at least half of the U.S. business is owned by people or companies from your country of citizenship. (There are more requirements, but those are the basics!).</p>
<p>I recently shared updates about some immigration changes on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/095-recent-immigration-updates-2021/">podcast</a> that affect some of the options that may be open to you, such as the International Entrepreneur Parole program and green cards. For additional options that meet your goals and any timing issues you have, I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>Visa alternatives</h2>
<p>Most founders would initially consider applying for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A</a> for extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">H-1B</a> for specialty occupations, but usually dependent O-3 and H-4 spouses are not immediately eligible to obtain work authorization.</p>
<p>Many startup founders, particularly those who have secured funding from investors, qualify for the O-1A, which is one of the quickest work visas to obtain and has some of the most stringent requirements. However, spouses are not eligible to apply for a work permit merely based on O-3 status.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your equity is diluting, you might actually be better poised for an H-1B. This option can be made more predictable through an alternative to the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">H-1B random lottery</a> in the spring if you pursue a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/066-cap-exempt-h-1bs-with-danielle-goldman/">cap-exempt H-1B</a> with a nonprofit or other qualified organization and possible concurrent employment. How does it work? Having one cap-exempt H-1B means you don’t have to go through the H-1B lottery process. Next, your startup could concurrently sponsor you for an H-1B, avoiding the lottery process as well. However, your spouse would not be eligible to apply for an H-4 work permit until you reach certain milestones in the green card process.</p>
<p>If you’re currently in the U.S. in E-2 status, you might consider filing for a Change of Status with USCIS. Premium processing is available for both the O-1A and H-1B petitions. With premium processing, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guarantees it will expedite its decision within 15 business days. A decision means either approval, a request for more evidence or a denial. Seeking a change of status is not the same as applying through a consulate abroad for a single- or multiple-entry visa in your passport.</p>
<h2>International Entrepreneur Parole</h2>
<p>If you established your company within the past 18 months, raised at least $264,147 in funding from a U.S. investor or investors (or $105,659 in government awards or grants) and maintain at least 10% equity in your startup, then you might qualify for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP). IEP allows you and your family to stay in the U.S. for up to 30 months — and your spouse is eligible to obtain a work permit.</p>
<p>I’m celebrating a victory — I recently helped advocate to make IEP better for founders, and as a result, one of the IEP program’s largest challenges was recently removed. Although IEP allows for an initial stay in the U.S. of up to 30 months, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, who have the final say on whether you and your family are granted IEP and for how long when you physically enter the country, were only authorizing entry in 12-month increments.</p>
<p>That was putting a burden on families, because it meant you and your family would have to exit and reenter the U.S. again in 12 months. That also meant that an IEP spouse’s work permit was only valid for a few months given the backlog in processing applications and the fact that the work permit is only valid for as long as the IEP stay is valid.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that this situation has changed for the better! I’m part of a group that is offering feedback to the government on how to make the IEP program more efficient and effective. We recently received confirmation that CBP now has the capacity to approve an initial stay in the U.S. for the full 30 months (not just 12 months at a time).</p>
<p>For more details on how to get IEP, take a look at this previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">Dear Sophie column</a> on that topic, or for context, you can listen to my podcast episodes on the &#8220;<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/078-parole-entry-process/">Parole Entry Process</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Green card options</h2>
<p>Except for perhaps the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/">green card through marriage</a>, green cards take much longer to obtain than a work visa. Most employment-based green cards, such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals with exceptional ability</a>, take a couple of years or potentially longer if you were born in India or China and you don’t have a priority date yet.</p>
<p>If you were born in China or India, you face waiting several years for a green card number to become available under the EB-2 NIW category. Processing for the EB-1A is the quickest of the two, particularly since this category is current for all countries according to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2022/visa-bulletin-for-november-2021.html">November Visa Bulletin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/074-diversity-immigrant-visa-program/">Diversity Immigrant Visa Program</a> (DV Program) offers another green card option, but it could take up to two years to get a green card if you’re selected in the annual DV Program lottery. The registration period for the fiscal year 2023 lottery is currently open through November 9, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>Each year, the U.S. Department of State, which oversees the DV program, reserves 50,000 green cards for individuals born in countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department publishes instructions each year, which includes the countries whose natives are eligible to register for the annual diversity lottery. Here is <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-English.pdf">the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that as of October 1, 2021, all green card candidates must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before their immigration medical examination.</p>
<p>One benefit of pursuing a green card is your spouse’s work authorization. If you’re currently in the U.S. and able to get to the stage of filing an I-485, the adjustment of status application, you and your spouse can also each file a work permit application, which would allow your spouse to work for an employer or be self-employed in the U.S. Many founders on E-2, for example from Europe, choose to self-petition an EB-2 NIW green card and concurrently file adjustment of status applications for the whole family.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best on whatever path you choose to take!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps tend to get bigger over time. Adding new features means adding more code, more third-party frameworks and more assets like images or videos. Resources like fonts or support documents get duplicated and things slip through the build process without the best optimization or compression.</p>
<p>Keeping apps small has upsides for the users and the developers, but it&#8217;s not necessarily top-of-mind all of the time. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that, depending on the size of a dev team and its priorities, can get forgotten until someone complains.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emergetools.com">Emerge</a>, a company out of YC&#8217;s W21 class, is building tools that help to keep apps small — monitoring changes from build to build and recommending actions that can trim the required storage space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Why keep apps small? There&#8217;s a bunch of reasons, as Emerge co-founder Joshua Cohenzadeh points out. Make your iOS app too big, for example, and the App Store will suggest to your users that they wait until they&#8217;re on WiFi — an opportunity for them to lose interest all together (in a<a href="https://eng.uber.com/how-uber-deals-with-large-ios-app-size/"> recent blog post</a>, Uber said that App Store size limitations cost them up to 10% of installs.) If you&#8217;re hoping to build a user base worldwide, meanwhile, you&#8217;ve got to consider that many potential users might be on slower networks or paying by the megabyte — so every byte counts. Plus, who hasn&#8217;t been trying to free up some space on their phone and thought &#8220;Wait, why the hell is [app x] taking up 400 MB?&#8221;</p>
<p>Emerge co-founders Josh Cohenzadeh and Noah Martin have been building things together since they were, quite literally, kids. In high school they built <a href="https://www.thnkdev.com/QuickRes/">QuickRes</a>, a menu bar tool for quickly changing the screen resolution on a Mac; over the years, they&#8217;d build a popular screenshot manager for the Mac, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nikola/id1412473099?mt=12">menu bar widget for controlling a Tesla</a> and a now-retired <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fire-for-tinder-2">tool for A/B testing your Tinder photos</a> that Cohenzadeh says got them on the wrong side of a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p>After college and stints at big companies, the two decided to stop making what were arguably side projects (or, as Josh lovingly referred to them, &#8220;dinky little apps&#8221;) and go full time into building a startup. They set out to apply to Y Combinator, and, while brainstorming ideas, came across research on the great lengths users were going to to transfer data in countries with limited mobile networks. This got them looking into where apps were wasting data … and the deeper they dug, the more they realized that app size was something that many teams — even within many big companies — weren&#8217;t consistently focusing on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a small company, you don&#8217;t have the resources to have your own performance team. You don&#8217;t have the resources to do all these crazy optimizations and things like that.&#8221; says Josh. &#8220;So the foundation of Emerge was just … let&#8217;s standardize this.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Emerge provides its insights in a few different ways. It can hook into your team&#8217;s GitHub to flag app size changes as comments in each pull request; Emerge&#8217;s dashboard, meanwhile, gives you multiple different views into what&#8217;s taking up space in your app and suggests ways to slim it down.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228711" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=768,340 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=680,301 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228711" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s X-Ray view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>The &#8220;X-ray&#8221; view gives an at-a-glance overview of how much space is taken up by each framework or asset. If you&#8217;re only using a certain framework for one or two rarely used features but it accounts for one-fifth of your app&#8217;s size, is it worth it? It&#8217;ll also highlight files that managed to sneak into your build multiple times. &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>shocking</em> how many companies have duplicate files,&#8221; says Josh.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Breakdown&#8221; view splits it up by category — how much of your app is the binary itself, how much of it is assets like images or video, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="738" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228713" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s Insights view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>An &#8220;Insights&#8221; tab, meanwhile, offers up the actions that could have the biggest impact on app size — like stripping binary symbols in a Swift binary, using a different image type for a given platform (like HEIC instead of PNG on iOS), or figuring out how to ditch those aforementioned duplicate files.</p>
<p>Curious as to what Emerge might find in your app? There&#8217;s one catch: Their tools aren&#8217;t open to everyone just yet. They&#8217;re currently working with each new company individually — because, as Josh tells me, most of the companies they&#8217;re working with require strict security reviews and legal agreements before granting tools like this any sort of access. Emerge plans to launch a &#8220;full self-service model&#8221; for smaller teams soon, he notes. Pricing varies company by company, based on criteria like number of apps, number of builds, team size and which platforms they&#8217;re building for. When it launched earlier this year, Emerge focused solely on iOS apps; last month the team added support for Android apps.</p>
<p>Emerge recently closed a $1.7 million round — its first so far. Cohenzadeh tells me the round was backed by Haystack, Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Liquid2 Ventures and a handful of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh water is one of the many resources increasingly being affected by climate change, which in turn affects businesses that rely on this abundant but still limited natural resource. <a href="https://www.waterplan.com/">Waterplan</a>, armed with a $2.6 million seed round, is looking to analyze and track not just how a company&#8217;s water use affects the local environment, but the mitigations that could help keep things wet when the seemingly inevitable crisis arrives.</p>
<p>Jose Galindo, Nicolas Wertheimer and their colleagues Matias Comercio and Olivia Cesio founded Waterplan after both working in and around the environmental sector for years. They realized that although there was a lot of action, data and planning around carbon emissions, comparatively little was being done around water risk, since it has yet to become as visible of a threat. They started the company and took it through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;More companies are disclosing and acting on water security and other water matters, but there&#8217;s a need for a SaaS platform to quantify and mediate water risk,&#8221; said Galindo. &#8220;Companies have had a reactive approach, but since these [climate-related] disruptions are getting more frequent, there&#8217;s an opportunity for them to predict this kind of thing and act proactively. Climate change is here, and this is going to accelerate.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course this isn&#8217;t simple advice like &#8220;don&#8217;t leave the tap running&#8221; but industrial-scale efforts like water table replenishment, major municipal works and so on. Waterplan first distills data from satellite imagery, which shows canopy, water bodies and other important indicators as objective measurements with plenty of context — years of images and analysis have established clear trends. This is combined with direct measurements made by water and environmental authorities that closely monitor these resources.</p>
<p>So (to invent an example) a factory that processes coffee beans might use 10,000 gallons per hour of water from a nearby river. Analysis could show that in 5-10 years that will no longer be a sustainable rate and will cause issues downriver, since there&#8217;s before and after data showing the factory&#8217;s effects. These issues would end up costing the company $40 million over that period. However, if local efforts to restore forests and extend tree canopy are doubled at a cost of $10 million, it will improve water retention and slow erosion, leading to a net increase in water availability — and sidestep that $40 million risk.</p>
<p>The actual reports are obviously more detailed and highly specific to a given location and company, but you can see below the kinds of scales they&#8217;re operating in and the type of data they track.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2228662,2228663,2228664,2228665"]</p>
<p>This sort of analysis and advice isn&#8217;t unprecedented by any means, but it&#8217;s the kind of thing that tends to be done once or a few times a year (if that) by an environmental consultant. Waterplan&#8217;s approach is to automate this as much as possible, making it a big data problem where factors can be plugged in and things like risk and mitigation strategies come out the other end. Of course it&#8217;s not so simple as that, but with the speed at which both markets and natural phenomena are changing these days, it needs to be done faster and in a more targeted, actionable way, the founders explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more expensive to be reactive than proactive,&#8221; said Wertheimer. &#8220;We need to make this a conscious effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galindo emphasized the fragmentation and incompatibility of much of the data concerning local water supplies, restoration efforts and other factors. It takes a lot of work to rectify these disparate sources and combine their data into a cohesive map and prediction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228128" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228128" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228128" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=2048,1110 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/waterplan-founders-high-res.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228128" class="wp-caption-text">From left, co-founders Matias Comercio, Nico Wertheimer, Jose Ignacio Galindo and Olivia Cesio sit on a stage. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Waterplan</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for companies to be able to make sense of what&#8217;s happening in different climate scenarios and locations, and to see it in a continuously updated and detailed way,&#8221; Galindo said. &#8220;Water is cheap and plentiful today but it won&#8217;t always be; there&#8217;s going to be a 30% gap in 2030 between supply and demand. We think that pressure will appear over the next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those with better data and a track record of taking steps proactively will be in a better position as the resource dwindles or competition over something like water credits heats up. Even now there is a serious shortage of carbon credits and other such resources and investments, meaning even companies that want to spend hundreds of millions may not have the opportunity to. (Carbon futures are a potential solution to this and a similar market may appear for resources like fresh water.)</p>

<p>Getting in early to what could be a major part of the climate monitoring ecosystem in the next decade seems to have been judged a fairly good bet by Waterplan&#8217;s first set of investors (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">after Y Combinator</a>). The $2.6 million round was led by Giant Ventures and a rather star-spangled list of individual participants: &#8220;Sir Richard Branson’s family, Monzo founder Tom Blomfield, Unity founders David Helgason and Nicholas Francis, NFL legend Joe Montana, Microsoft’s former global water program manager Paul Fleming, MCJ collective, Climate Capital, Newtopia, Jetstream and Mixpanel founder Tim Treffen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The near-term plan, Wertheimer and Galindo said, is primarily to ramp up development; they need engineers and hydrologists to handle the complex work of building out the platform so it can continue to produce the kinds of insights desired by various industries and environments.</p>
<p>Although the data and analysis they produce would likely be welcomed by governments and NGOs, the stakeholders most likely to make change (and, it must be said, pay for the service) are private companies aiming to cut risk or improve their local standing. But once traction is achieved and the product and methods nailed down, the founders (who emphasized their involvement with water access and NGOs earlier) hope to make it more widely available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company confirmed that reservations for the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck have surpassed 160,000, less than six months after its debut.</p>
<p>The U.S. automaker has been accepting $100 refundable reservations for the vehicle since its unveiling. Ford has seen a high level of consumer interest, bagging 20,000 reservations on the first day, 44,000 by the end of the second day and 120,000 by the end of June.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Jim Farley said that nearly 75% of those customers were new to Ford.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>He added that around 40% of people were planning on trading in an internal combustion engine truck, which “it indicates a move a little bit faster to full-size truck [battery electric vehicles] than maybe our optimistic assumptions,” he said.</p>
<p>In response to the reservation figures, the automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">earmark an additional $250 million and bolster its workforce by 450</a> to increase the annual production capacity of the Lightning. The trucks will go on sale to customers in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The Lightning, which will be available in four trims, is a critical part of the automaker’s strategy to transition a greater portion of its fleet to electric. Ford is joining newer entrants like Rivian — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">which rolled its first R1T truck off the production line in September</a> — in taking aim at the pickup truck segment. The F-150 is the best-selling truck in America. Ford reported it had sold 787,422 F-series trucks in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The base version of the Lightning will start at $39,974, while the midseries XLT model will start at $52,974, both excluding taxes.</p>
