										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago, Notion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/work-collaboration-startup-notion-labs-cozies-up-to-silicon-valleys-top-accelerators/">partnered with dozens of accelerators and incubators</a> to provide free credits for its work collaboration platform to their portfolio startups. The firm is now aggressively making the program open to all startups.</p>
<p>Notion is launching a new startup program Tuesday to offer a credit of at least $500 to any startup globally to try its product for free &#8212; regardless of its size and funding status. Based on the size of the team, the credit could give startups access to Notion’s premium offerings at no cost for as long as a year &#8212; if not longer.</p>
<p>When Notion originally launched the program, it was attempting to “make sure that startups around the world adopt Notion,” said Akshay Kothari, chief operating officer of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically for the work collaboration platform in the past two years. The startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/">valued at $2 billion</a> in its most recent financing round, has emerged as the productivity suite of choice for many startups (Figma, Substack, Modern Health, Mixpanel, Buffer and Headspace to name a few), developers, creatives and designers among others.</p>
<p>The number of startups using Notion has surged 4x in the last year as businesses around the globe embraced remote working, it said. Over 50% of startups in Y Combinator&#8217;s recent batch have a Notion workspace, and 90 of Forbes&#8217; Cloud 100 companies have a Notion team workspace. About 28% of startups listed on Crunchbase that have raised over $1 million are using Notion globally.</p>
<p>It’s become quite common to see even startup founders in India &#8212; a market Notion has admittedly not particularly focused a lot on &#8212; share their pitch decks created and stored on Notion to potential investors. Many are writing announcements on Notion, taking and sharing notes with their teams in Notion pages.</p>
<p>Kothari said as part of the new push, Notion is also developing new templates to remove friction from such use cases. Additionally, it’s also launching what it calls a startup starter pack, which will feature guides, tutorials, livestream opportunities, customer stories and frequently asked questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our goal is to get to a point where Notion becomes a tool that every startup in the world goes to without even having to think about it,” he said.</p>
<p>To reach that level of scale, Notion is also partnering with two infrastructure giants that are widely admired by startups: AWS and Stripe. The two firms will now provide Notion’s premium offerings &#8212; to a certain limit of credits &#8212; to hundreds of thousands of startups in their programs, Kothari said.</p>
<p>Just as significant AWS and Stripe have become to startups, “we think Notion can become the information infrastructure with them,” he said. “Now that we have launched this, we will continue to look at forming more partnerships.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Notion has been a boon for the Stripe Atlas community, helping businesses of all sizes stay organized and aligned through all of their key milestones, and bringing employees closer than ever before,&#8221; said Krithika Muthukumar, Startups Business Lead at Stripe, in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to bring Notion into the Atlas program and explore new ways we can support our community together.&#8221; (In a statement, AWS said its customers “rave” about Notion and it will explore more ways to strategically collaborate with Notion.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sisudata.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to help businesses make better decisions, announced today it has raised $62 million in a Series C round of funding led by Green Bay Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and NEA also put money in the round, along with new investor Geodesic Ventures. The financing brings San Francisco-based Sisu’s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $128 million. A16z and NEA co-led the company’s $52.5 million Series B in October of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a>, a former Stanford University professor, founded Sisu Data out of his lab, spending years on research at the school before leaving to focus on the endeavor full time. The company’s mission is simple, even if the technology powering it is not: to operationalize the world’s data so that businesses can “make the best possible decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, businesses have massive amounts of complex data, but not enough time, people or the right tools to analyze it,” Bailis said. “That’s the massive problem Sisu is working to solve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical organization has way more data collected than people actually use, because it’s cheaper and easier to get this kind of data and consolidate, especially in the cloud,” Bailis told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business metrics are constantly changing. By the time a company realizes those metrics have changed, and then attempts to understand why, a company could lose a lot &#8212; including productivity, time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu’s real-time “Decision Intelligence Engine” aims to give analysts and business leaders a way to analyze their cloud data to not only understand what’s happening in their business, but why it’s happening &#8212; and most importantly, to Bailis, what actions to take in response. The end result, notes Green Bay Ventures co-managing director Anthony Schiller, is that companies are equipped with insights they need “to make the best decisions in improving the operations, profitability and success of their business.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you&#8217;re a modern organization, you have information about where your users are coming from, what they&#8217;re doing, how they&#8217;re benefiting from your product or service, why they’re renewing and it&#8217;s kind of unbelievable,” Bailis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the executive declined to reveal at what valuation this latest round was raised or any hard revenue figures, he did say that Sisu &#8220;more than tripled&#8221; its revenue and saw “steady customer traction” over the past year. Customers hail from a variety of industries and include Mastercard, Samsung, Wayfair, Autodesk, Upwork and Gusto. Bailis described the Series C as a “preemptive inside round.” He also noted that Sisu has doubled its headcount to 65 over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also today, Sisu revealed two new products set to be released this month that it says will help it achieve its goal of “closing the decision gap”: explorations and dashboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explorations aims to allow Sisu users to “quickly and easily” dig into, pivot and visualize metrics, without requiring code. Dashboards will permit users to view explorations, track metric changes and share key data drivers with colleagues and executives. Customers will be able to visualize their data in any way they’d like. For example, they could look at revenue by day or week and view that data with any type of graph, and then collaborate with others in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sisu plans to integrate the new tools with its existing analysis capabilities so that its users can move between analyzing what has happened in their business to why it has happened, and what to do about it &#8212; “all on a single platform and without writing any code,” the company says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the conventional approaches on reporting and dashboards are really slow, and they&#8217;re incomplete and not ultimately actionable, or a lot of people who can’t actually make decisions, they&#8217;re saying &#8212; ‘here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on,’ ” Bailis said. “And so with Susu, users can look at a result, such as revenue is down, and can go get a detailed comprehensive answer as to why, literally in seconds without ever leaving the product, and then can go and take that result, and share it out with their team, who can go in, create their own analyses and iterate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Sisu, he said, the machine learning and cloud native engine “does all the hard work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The benefit here is really simplicity,” Bailis said. “How you get simple answers quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Horowitz, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and general partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a16z, said his firm was first drawn to Sisu because of Bailis’ reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was impressed with what I’d heard about Peter&#8217;s [Bailis’] work at Berkeley and Stanford &#8212; especially from his PhD co-advisors Ali Ghodsi and Ion Stoica, who co-founded Databricks,” Horowitz told TechCrunch. In fact, Ghodsi had told Horowitz how Berkeley’s computer science department was so impressed with Peter’s dissertation work that they broke their own rule against hiring their own students for the first time in 20 years to try to get Peter to stay as faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The systems Bailis and his team built on campus are now the Sisu engine, and were already in use at big tech companies like Google and Microsoft at the time a16z first invested. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was amazing because these big tech players almost always build in house, but here they were using software developed by a twenty-something-year-old Stanford professor,” Horowitz said. “It solved a real pain point: even the best funded companies in tech don’t have enough analysts to make decisions from the data they have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horowitz views what Sisu is doing in a similar trajectory as the creation of the spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the days before spreadsheets, businesses had rows and rows of people at desks and each person would calculate one cell in a financial model, which was tedious. Then the spreadsheet was created and everything changed &#8212; anyone was capable of financial planning,” he wrote via email. “ We are in a similar spot with decision making. People can think in two, maybe three dimensions, but their data is now in hundreds of dimensions, with billions of data points. As a result, humans don&#8217;t make good decisions when it comes to data, and Sisu’s engine has the power to dramatically simplify these decisions and transform history.”</span></p>

<p>“We’re working on a scalable solution that handles the end of life of these materials,” Fairmat founder Benjamin Saada told me. He previously co-founded <a href="https://expliseat.com">Expliseat</a>.</p>
<p>The company believes that high-tech materials aren’t going away. Carbon fiber composites are extremely useful for wind turbines or aircrafts for instance as they provide incredible properties. But you don’t need to use sophisticated materials for everything.</p>
<p>That’s why we rely heavily on cheaper materials, such as plastics, wood and various metal alloys to build new stuff. Fairmat doesn’t want to replace carbon fiber composite in wind turbines and aircrafts.</p>
<p>It wants to replace plastics, wood and metal in everyday objects. The company is transforming existing carbon fiber composite into a new material that is both lightweight and robust.</p>
<p>“Today, carbon composite waste is essentially burned or landfilled,” Saada said. With Fairmat’s process, the company can recycle the composite material with a mechanical process that isn&#8217;t too demanding. It doesn’t involve heating carbon fiber composite waste for instance. The startup is also relying on machine learning to test the physical properties of its material.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fairmat then plans to sell its material to industrial clients so that they can use it themselves. For instance, you could imagine building the cargo box of a cargo bike with Fairmat’s material. It could be lighter than wood or metal and it also offers a better carbon footprint compared to virgin material.</p>
<p>Up next, Faitmat plans to increase the size of its team from 15 to 30 team members. The company is working on partnerships with suppliers for carbon fiber composite waste as well as potential clients. It expects to start selling its material at scale at some point during the second semester of 2022.</p>
<p>After that, the startup will iterate and work on other types of material with different properties. In a couple of years, if everything goes well, you might be buying a chair, a laptop or a car built with the company’s material without realizing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monetization for the creator economy continues to be a huge issue and opportunity, but creators mostly have to lock themselves into platforms like Patreon to realize their value. A better method would be to have a membership system for creators which sat across several platforms.</p>
<p>Now, GMG Ventures (parent company of The Guardian newspaper) has unvested in <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">Unlock</a>, the developer of an open-source, Ethereum-based protocol designed to monetize and manage community memberships.</p>
<p>The $4 million funding round was led by VC firms including Betaworks, Cygni Labs, GMG Ventures, and Metacartel Ventures China, along with participation from early investors.</p>
<p>Unlock says its membership/monetization solution is used by artists, musicians, game developers (including Decentraland), writers, Discord communities, and others. It also plans partnerships with major media brands which are using its protocol.</p>
<p>Unlock CEO Julien Genestoux said: “With the funding we have raised to date, Unlock will continue growing to become the most complete, open-source platform to achieve this goal.”</p>
<p>Genestoux previously built Superfeedr, an RSS feed API purchased by Medium.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Unlock is an NFT-based protocol that records all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Use cases include a WordPress plug-in that allows developers to add a membership/subscription option, and a community-created plug-in for Shopify enables retailers to add an Unlock-based purchase option on their website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Unlock’s open-source protocol for creator community memberships is poised to redefine the way creators interact with and grow their audiences in the years to come,” said Thomas Lueke at Cherry Ventures. “We look forward to celebrating Unlock’s growth as it continues to navigate this space and are excited to have invested in the company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Genomic data is considered to be the key to unlocking so-called &#8220;precision medicine&#8221;. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195">Some estimates</a> suggest that by 2025, 500 million human genomes will have been sequenced, but only a fraction of it is being utilized for drug discovery and precision medicine.</p>
<p>One of the key startups to emerge in the space is Lifebit, which allows wider access to global biomedical data for drug discovery. It’s now raised a $60 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Existing investors Eurazeo, Pentech Ventures and Beacon Capital also participated.</p>
<p>Lifebit says it has a patented technology for federating the data around genomic data, allowing researchers to get more insights while keeping the data secure. Privacy issues are regularly raised around genomic data. Let&#8217;s face it, it doesn’t get more personal than your genome.</p>

<p>The company says that rare disease patients are likely to receive an accurate diagnosis up to five times more often when human genetic data is involved in the diagnosis. That’s why these &#8220;Clinico-genomic&#8221; databases can be so transformative.</p>
<p>Lifebit has acquired clients across the public and private sectors, including the Hong Kong Genome Project, and an AI-partnership with German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim. It also won the U.K. government contract to power Genomics England.</p>
<p>Dr. Maria Chatzou Dunford, Lifebit CEO and former bioinformatics researcher said: “We believe all biomedical data that can be used to save lives, should be used. People are dying because of how this data is being handled, and making distributed highly sensitive biomedical data usable while keeping it secure in-place and combining it with other data has never been possible, until now.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Partner at Tiger Global, John Curtius, added: “We are confident that Lifebit&#8217;s innovative and industry-leading software solutions, paired with their customer-first approach, will drive rapid global adoption and accelerate breakthroughs in precision medicine.”</p>
<p>Lifebit competes with DNAnexus, Seven Bridges and Iqvia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Somehow the third quarter of 2021 is coming to a close. Instead of a period filled with family and friends and fun, in many parts of the world, the COVID era dragged on, leaving us largely working from home and executing more phone calls than impromptu brunches. Alas.</p>
<p>But in the last handful of quarters, COVID and its impacts have proven to be attractive periods for both startup fundraising and growth. The second quarter, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">saw huge sums of private capital disbursed around the world</a>, partially predicated on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/latin-americas-second-wave-of-digital-transformation/">underlying performance from startups themselves</a>, and partially thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/will-rising-interest-rates-scupper-the-startup-surge/">inexpensive capital bolstering venture coffers</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Now, with the third quarter wrapping up, The Exchange is prepping for a lengthy dive into global venture capital results. To kick that off, today we’re asking a series of questions: We want to understand how strong Europe’s third quarter was and if the region can match its prior &#8212; stellar &#8212; fundraising results. We’re interested in what’s going on with China’s venture capital market in the wake of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">host of regulatory changes</a>.</p>

And we want to know where in Latin America we’re seeing the most fundraising acceleration, along with just how important mega-rounds are to recent, aggregate global totals; are big deals still setting the tone for global venture totals?</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll explore each question in brief, ahead of what we presume will be a long, multi-part dive into the data once Q3 comes to a close later this week.</p>
<h2>Did Europe’s venture scene keep raising record sums?</h2>
<p>Our first question for Europe will be whether it managed to match its impressive Q2 results. There are signs that it may have, as France <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2021/09/22/un-milliard-d-euros-leves-en-une-journee-du-jamais-vu-pour-la-french-tech_6095595_3234.html">recently celebrated</a> the slightly random but no less significant milestone of &#8220;1 billion euros raised in one day.&#8221; Our suspicion is that these deals were actually announced in close succession because none of the involved startups wanted to miss out on the spotlight after raising record amounts &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/marketplace-platform-mirakl-raises-555-million-at-3-5-billion-valuation/">$555 million</a> for marketplace platform Mirakl, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/sorare-raises-680-million-for-its-fantasy-sports-nft-game/">$680 million</a> for fantasy sports startup Sorare and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-22/softbank-invests-in-french-secondhand-site-vestiaire-collective">$209 million</a> for Vestiaire Collective.</p>
<p>As a follow-on, we&#8217;ll likely look into whether this has anything to do with Brexit: Is capital simply redirecting out of the U.K.? Our intuition is that it isn&#8217;t, since we are still hearing about a lot of activity in London and beyond. But capital that might have kept flowing in that direction could now be going to other places in Europe – so we&#8217;ll take a closer look at how widely distributed it is, and also at what&#8217;s going on with Euronext in terms of tech IPOs.</p>
<h2>What’s going on with China’s venture capital market?</h2>
<p>Recent regulatory shifts have remade China’s technology landscape. Tech giants have been brought to heel, and rule changes to edtech, social media, gaming and other varietals have shaken both tech companies and other industries in the country. Despite all that, it isn’t hard to find commentary discussing the possible positive impact on China’s economy thanks to the new set of rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of digital marketing firms and others has taken its lobbying against Google&#8217;s plan to phase out tracking cookies &#8212; by replacing them with alternative technologies which the tech giant claims will protect user privacy &#8212; to the European Union, lodging a formal complaint with the bloc&#8217;s antitrust regulators.</p>
<p>The self-styled &#8216;Movement for an Open Web&#8217; (MOW), as the opaque group pushing the complaint is now called (RIP &#8216;Marketers for an Open Web&#8217;), put out a <a href="https://movementforanopenweb.com/calls-on-eu-to-curb-googles-anti-competitive-behaviour/">press release</a> announcing the move today &#8212; and claiming it has provided the Commission with &#8220;evidence of Google’s technology changes, how they impact choice and competition&#8221;, and offered some &#8220;potential remedies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google and the Commission have been contacted for comment on the complaint.</p>
<p>EU regulators finally opened an investigation of Google&#8217;s adtech this summer, announcing an in-depth probe in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">June</a> that they said would include delving into the Privacy Sandbox proposal.</p>
<p>A UK probe of that was announced months earlier, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a>, and the issue remains a live one on the Competition and Markets Authority&#8217;s (CMA) desk &#8212; with Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">suggesting concessions this summer</a>.</p>
<p>MOW&#8217;s suggested remedies to EU regulators include requirements that Google should notify the EU ahead of time over any changes to its browser (Chrome/Chromium) &#8212; in order to &#8220;enabl[e] privacy and competition assessments to be made by the EU and data protection authorities in line with Google’s proposed remedy to the UK’s Competition and Market Authority and Information Commissioner’s Office&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>So here you can see the strange sight of a campaign which was kicked off by a bunch of marketers seemingly lobbying <em>for </em>user &#8216;privacy&#8217;; but of course they would say that wouldn&#8217;t they &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">given the EU has already flagged &#8220;user privacy&#8221;</a> as one of the areas its antitrust investigation will be considering. (Additionally, the UK&#8217;s CMA and Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office are doing joint working on the Privacy Sandbox complaint.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably MOW&#8217;s website still does not disclose exactly who the members of this anti-Google-Privacy-Sandbox/pro-tracking-cookie group are &#8212; aside from the name of its director, James Rosewell (co-founder of UK mobile marketing company, <a href="https://51degrees.com/about-us">51 Degrees</a>).</p>
<p>Instead it writes that: &#8220;MOW is supported by businesses that between them have annual revenues of $40BN+. The name has been changed because more businesses, not just marketing companies, are realising the threat from Privacy Sandbox and the benefit of joining the MOW campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be the case that MOW has indeed evolved its membership to include entities with a genuine (rather than opportunistic) concern for user privacy. But given that it won&#8217;t disclose its membership it&#8217;s impossible to know&#8230;</p>

<p>Commenting on the complaint in a statement,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Rosewell said: “The internet was originally envisaged as an open environment outside the control of any single body. Google maintains it is making these changes to protect privacy but if not properly policed, the move threatens digital media, online privacy and innovation.</span></p>
<p>“Solutions aligned to laws – not self-serving misuse of the web architecture by the members of Big Tech such as Google – are needed. More people, surrendering more personal data to fewer companies doesn’t improve anyone’s privacy while stifling competition and boosting their huge profits even further.”</p>
<p>Lawyer Tim Cowen, who is listed as a legal advisor to MOW and chair of the antitrust practice at Preiskel &amp; Co LLP, added: “We’re asking that the EU Commission create a level playing field for all digital businesses, to maintain and protect an open web. Google says they’re strengthening ‘privacy’ for end users but they’re not, what they’re really proposing is a creepy data mining party.”</p>
<p>Google has already delayed its timeline for implementing Privacy Sandbox &#8212; announcing back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">June</a> that it would be taking longer to make the transition away from tracking cookies as a result of ongoing engagement with the UK&#8217;s antitrust regulator.</p>
<p>It has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">offered <em>not</em> to phase out tracking cookies</a> unless or until the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority is happy that the transition to alternative technologies can be done in a manner that protects competition and privacy.</p>
<p>So MOW, presumably, scents blood &#8212; spying an opportunity to press the case for a wider, pan-European freeze on Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox play, rather than merely getting some UK-specific checks and balances.</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the Commission will be sympathetic to MOW&#8217;s complaint, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, a privacy researcher and consultant, told TechCrunch: &#8220;The Commission currently has its own investigation, so I could envisage that this additional complaint could constitute a case in point. Technology anti-competition proceedings tend to be slow, so the investigation could simply accumulate things in a snowball manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A long time ago, the European Data Protection Supervisor identified potential links between privacy and competition. Opinions and activities followed. However, it is true that EU Competition regulators are prioritising their own principles, rather than focusing on privacy,&#8221; he also told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I doubt that any [world] competition regulator would be balancing competition with privacy. They should, I believe, consider it an internal aspect of society and technology. Perhaps it will happen to some degree? But while we do know that UK CMA and ICO are in contact, it is not known if the EC and EDPS are also in sync in relation to the latest investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that Google has already proposed a number of legally binding commitments to the UK&#8217;s CMA around Privacy Sandbox, there are several interested entities in this story who may see a &#8216;quick win&#8217; if the bloc can be persuaded to swiftly adopt much the same framework, assuming the CMA also agrees to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the most effortless action would be to take the commitments issued to CMA, copy-and-paste them, perhaps modify a bit and hand to the EU. I&#8217;m not sure if this would work out so easily. However, it is clear that Google wants to remove this potential roadblock as fast as possible,&#8221; agreed Olejnik.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite clear that consumer detriment may happen not only from market conduct but other aspects are notable. For example privacy and data protection standards,&#8221; he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Netflix is expanding its mobile gaming push with the launch of three more gaming titles which will become exclusively available to Netflix members in select European markets.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is expanding its mobile gaming push with the launch of three more gaming titles which will become exclusively available to Netflix members in select European markets. The company today is introducing a trio of casual games &#8212; &#8220;Shooting Hoops,&#8221; &#8220;Teeter Up,&#8221; and &#8220;Card Blast&#8221; &#8212; to Netflix members in Spain and Italy, as well as Poland, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">Netflix recently began marketing</a> its first members-only mobile games within its Android app.</p>
<p>Similarly, the new titles will be made available using the same model. Through a new &#8220;Games&#8221; tab inside the Netflix app, members will be directed to the games&#8217; listings on the Google Play Store for their region. Here, they&#8217;ll download and install the game as they would any other app. But when it comes time to log in, they&#8217;ll need their Netflix credentials to begin playing.</p>
<p>The new games will also be entirely free to play, without any advertising or in-app purchases. While the first two titles to launch within Netflix&#8217;s Games tab were tied to the popular series, &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; these new games have no connection to any Netflix movie or show. Instead, they are simple, casual games meant to appeal to a wide range of gamers. They represent Netflix&#8217;s increased investment focused on making mobile games a part of a broader entertainment offering that is now growing to include more than just streaming content.</p>
<p>The games will today arrive in Poland, where they&#8217;ll join the existing &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; titles. Meanwhile, Netflix members in Italy and Spain will gain access to both the trio of new games and the two existing &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games.</p>
<p>The additions will officially launch today at 8 AM PT, which is 5 PM in Italy and Spain. That&#8217;s when the games will go live on Netflix&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>The company recently <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">spoke</a> about its plans to expand into the gaming market during its Q2 earnings, saying it was in the early stages of exploring what this model may look like.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view gaming as another content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted TV,&#8221; read Netflix&#8217;s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">shareholder letter,</a> adding that its initial focus would be on free games designed for mobile devices. &#8220;&#8230;Since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,&#8221; the company explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209173" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209173" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209173" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="561" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg 1422w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?resize=680,561 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-10.26.03-AM.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209173" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot of Teeter Up on Google Play</p></div></p>
<p>In late August, Netflix made good on those statements when it shifted two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; titles created by the Allen, Texas-based game studio <a href="https://bonusxp.com/">BonusXP</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">become Netflix exclusives</a>. These games, however, had been previously available on the Play Store and continues to be playable by those who already had them installed. But new gamers could now discover the two games &#8212; &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3: The Game&#8221; from within the Netflix app.</p>
<p>That same model continues with the new releases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Card Blast&#8221; is licensed from U.S.-based <a href="https://rogueco.com/games/">Rogue Games</a>, while&#8221;Shooting Hoops&#8221; and &#8220;Teeter Up&#8221; come from Canadian developer <a href="https://frostypop.com/games">Frosty Pop</a>.</p>
<p>These developers aren&#8217;t credited on the Play Store listings, as the games themselves are published under Netflix&#8217;s Google Play account.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, after TechCrunch happened upon one of the new titles, Netflix confirmed the details about the launch plans and offered a statement about its mobile gaming expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Starting today, Netflix members in Spain and Italy can play five mobile games on Android as part of our ongoing games rollout,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said. &#8220;These five games include &#8216;Stranger Things: 1984,&#8217;  &#8216;Stranger Things 3: The Game,&#8217; &#8216;Card Blast,&#8217; &#8216;Teeter Up,&#8217; and &#8216;Shooting Hoops,&#8217; which are all also available in Poland now. We’re still in the very early days, but we’re excited to bring these exclusive games as part of the Netflix membership &#8211; with no ads and no in-app purchases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Earlier, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">explained</a> it chose Poland as the initial test market for mobile gaming because the country has an active mobile gaming audience, which made it seem like a good fit for this early feedback.</p>
<p>Today, the company notes that Italy and Spain were chosen as additional markets for similar reasons and because the European market, overall, is an important one for Netflix.</p>
<p>Netflix says it plans to launch games in other regions, including the U.S., at some point in the future, but could not say when. It also eventually aims to bring its games to iOS.</p>
<p>The suite of mobile games will be available within the Games tab in Netflix&#8217;s Android app in Poland, Italy, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">and Spain, starting at 8 AM ET/11 AM PT/ 5 PM CET today. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://heartcore.com/">Heartcore Capital</a>, one of the few VCs to focus on consumer technology, has raised a $200 million early-stage fund for those kinds of startups across Europe. Heartcore IV, the firm’s flagship investment vehicle, will be supported by Heartcore Progression Beta, a $50 million ‘opportunity fund’ for follow on rounds in consumer tech.</p>
<p>The firm said both vehicles were oversubscribed. Investors in the funds include Hermann Haraldsson (Boozt), Andrew Stalbow (Seriously), Phillip Chambers and Kasper Hulthin (Peakon), Paul Crusius and Marco Vietor (Audibene), Morten Strunge (Podimo, Mofibo), and Max-Josef Meier (Finn).</p>
<p>Most European VCs tech to be B2B/ SaaS focused, but Heartcore has specialized in consumer technology VC.</p>
<p>In Heartcore’s favour is the fact that there are 500 million consumers in the EU spending an annual $11 trillion, making it on-par with the US consumer market. It also has a larger middle class. And while B2B platforms must usually win the US or at least originate from there, the B2C market tends to be more local.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also acted as an accelerant for consumer technology, forcing po[ulations to take up digital services such as online groceries</p>
<p>Heartcore has had a 14-year history in consumer tech with its portfolio raising close to $1 billion in follow-on financing over the past 12 months, the company said.</p>
<p>Swedish consumer personal finance manager Tink’s recently sold to Visa for  $2.2BN, and Heartcore was the largest venture investor at the time of acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has also invested in virtual restaurants (Taster), open banking (Tink), quick-commerce (Weezy), fashion e-commerce (Boozt), cellular agriculture (Gourmey), digital health (Kaia Health, Natural Cycles) or subscription commerce (La Fourche, Italic).</p>
<p>Max Niederhofer, Heartcore Capital partner, told me: “Europe historically has been great at consumer tech. You’ve had Skype, Last fm, Spotify and Supercell. All of those are consumer companies. I think the thing that&#8217;s happening is that a lot of the consumer champions are domestic champions. Lando is huge in Germany. The biggest insurance tech company in France is actually a French company. So, as technology disrupts every consumer spend category, there&#8217;s a lot of big companies being built in Europe that are primarily domestic or  regional, and that&#8217;s where we feel there&#8217;s a lot of room to play.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups have thrown a curve ball into the world of financial services, by building more flexible, cheaper and user-friendly tools to businesses and consumers, who in turn are walking away from older incumbents and taking their custom to newer providers. In the latest development, a startup called <a href="https://highnoteplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highnote</a> is launching with ambitions to make waves in the world of card issuing, by making it easy for any company of any size to provide virtual payment cards to their customers. Founded by PayPal alums, the company is exiting stealth mode today and also announcing $54 million in funding to take its first steps.</p>
<p>The sum includes both a Seed round and a Series A, with Oak HC/FT both leading the Series A and co-leading the Seed with Costanoa Ventures. XYZ, SVB Capital, and WestCap also participated, alongside some notable individuals, including Bill Ready (the former COO of PayPal and current president of commerce and payments at Google) and Renaud Laplanche (the CEO of Upgrade).</p>
<p>Own-branded payment cards from retailers and other companies are far from being a novel idea at this point: they and their loyalty programs have been around for decades. There have even been other incredibly successful startups, like <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marqeta</a>, that have been built on the premise of democratizing that opportunity.</p>
<p>The difference with Highnote is that the company believes that many of the currently solutions still take too long to provision, and ultimately are not that creative as products: there is a new opening in the market to virtualize the process, a la Apple Card, to make it something that a company of any size could introduce (not just an Apple), and to bring in significantly more flexibility into what it even means to provide credit to consumers these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an incredible opportunity today to design a platform built for purpose, to fill the need for embedded finance, and to allow businesses to move more quickly,&#8221; said John Macllwaine, the ex-GM of PayPal subsidiary Braintree, who co-founded Highnote with Kin Kee, Braintree&#8217;s former director of architecture. &#8220;Marqeta is doing a great job illuminating the opportunities, but the platforms was built 10 years ago and it was designed for a certain use case. They are where they are,&#8221; he concluded with a small shrug. ¯&#95;(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>The current vogue for embedded finance &#8212; where a variety of financial services, in themselves complex to build but easy to integrate from third parties by way of APIs &#8212; figures strongly here. Traditionally card services have been based around a very limited set of ideas.</p>
<p>If you are a retailer, the card is intended to encourage consumers to shop more with you (not anyone else); those who are not retailers (say, an airline) tie them in with loyalty points that can be redeemed with the brand, or businesses participating in the brand&#8217;s loyalty scheme. In each case, the brand tended to be big, and the basics of the card were constructed around payment limits, interest for unpaid balances and so on. To get one required filling out applications at the check-out counter, and the whole process taking weeks to complete (at which point you would get a physical card in the mail).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Highnote take on this is to lean on the concept of embedded finance to expand the range of things that can be built into a &#8220;payment card&#8221;, and to make that card a lot easier for any kind of business to procure.</p>
<p>Initially, the company is offering a variety of &#8220;cards&#8221; to its clients &#8212; virtual, physical and tokenized &#8212; and also giving them ways to let their customers manage those cards and their financial lives more intelligently, including by letting them open bank accounts, and to manage and monitor how their cards are being used. It also gives significantly more control to the companies themselves to monitor usage and spend across their networks.</p>
<p>Over time, you could imagine a number of different services being rolled in at the point of sale that also leverage the credit opportunity, including potentially buy now, pay later options, or other ways to pay flexibly. Yes, there are already BNPL companies that have expanded into cards; and yes companies focusing on payments also are building credit products. But what Highnote is offering is something different. It can be argued that brands have gradually been disintermediated from transactions online &#8212; the complex process is essentially outsourced to others, either by selling through marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s, or by embedding the complex process built and powered by another company. What Highnote gives those brands is the promise of owning it, and the data associated with it, again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of market opportunity that you would expect from payments experts as founders &#8212; who ironically probably witnessed first-hand just how things have evolved &#8212; and that is why investors were keen to back them early on.</p>
<p>“We’ve backed many of the leading companies in the fintech space, but there is something really special about John, Kin, and their team,” said Matt Streisfeld, Partner at Oak HC/FT, in a statement. “We understand the many challenges enterprises currently face in embedding payments capabilities to drive customer engagement, loyalty, and revenue, as well as for consumers and SMBs that need access to wages and funds immediately. We see a massive opportunity emerging to whomever is able to crack the code. We’re building that at <span class="il">Highnote</span>, and as a result, we are thrilled to provide the support they need to continue their incredible velocity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors’ BrightDrop continues its breakneck pace to market as the automaker takes aim at last-mile commercial and cargo delivery market segments. BrightDrop on Tuesday said it would add a second delivery vehicle to its lineup, with telecom giant Verizon as its first slated customer.</p>
<p>In addition, GM said it had completed the first production builds of its flagship EV600 van. FedEx will begin receiving its vehicles (it placed an order for 500) before the end of the year. It’s now the fastest vehicle program to market in the automaker’s history, GM said in a statement.</p>
<p>The automaker scored a second customer for the EV600 with Merchants Fleet, which in February said it would purchase 12,600 vehicles.</p>
<p>Verizon will use the new medium-sized EV410 vehicle as part of its field maintenance and servicing fleet. The two companies did not disclose the size of the order or other terms.</p>
<p>The new van will have over 400 cubic feet of cargo space and measure just under 20 feet overall in length. GM said the vehicle is ideal for maneuvering in crowded spaces, like urban areas, particularly in the online grocery delivery and telecom maintenance segments.</p>
<p>The automaker says that fleet managers will save $7,000 annually using EV600s compared with internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>
<p>The two vehicles each have an estimated range of 250 miles on the automaker’s Ultium battery platform, and weigh less than 10,000 pounds. The EV410 will join the EV600 in being manufactured at GM’s CAMI Assembly facility in Ingersoll, Ontario. GM said it is partnering with a U.S. supplier in Michigan for an initial low-volume production, as the CAMI plant undergoes conversions to ramp-up production of the EV600 starting in November 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The introduction of BrightDrop at the beginning of this year signals General Motors’ strong interest in diversifying its market opportunities, as it seeks to lock-in the last-mile commercial and delivery segments. To get there, GM said it would invest around $1 billion CAD ($788 million) to convert the CAMI plant to the Canada’s first electric delivery van manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>The electric cargo and delivery segment is certainly a huge opportunity for GM and other automakers. Verizon is part of a slew of companies, including FedEx and UPS, that have said they would cut or even eliminate net emissions from their operations.</p>
<p><em>Correction: The article originally stated FedEx would receive 500 vehicles by the end of the year. FedEx will receive vehicles this year, but on a rolling basis. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Angle Labs, the company behind the <a href="https://www.angle.money">Angle Protocol</a>, has raised a $5 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The small team has been working on a euro stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Fabric VC, Wintermute, Divergence Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Alven, Julien Bouteloup and Frédéric Montagnon.</p>
<p>“I was playing around with <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> and I realized that I was exposing myself to a huge euro/dollar foreign exchange risk. Basically, the euro lost 10% in value against the dollar in 2020,” Angle Labs co-founder Pablo Veyrat told me.</p>
<p>There are a handful of euro-based stablecoins already, but their market capitalization is ridiculously small when you compare those stablecoins against USD-based stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT) or DAI.</p>
<p>Instead of opening a bank account and storing a ton of EUR on this bank account, the team of engineers have designed a new protocol with three different stakeholders that are looking for three different things.</p>
<p>People who want a digital euro will be able to buy agEUR. At any point in time, one agEUR should be worth one EUR. In order to guarantee the value of Angle’s stablecoins over time, the protocol is designed to accept collateral against stablecoins, such as (wrapped) bitcoins, ethers and more (wBTC, wETH, etc.).</p>
<p>As an incentive, the protocol issues perpetual futures. This way, some traders will open leveraged positions expecting to generate returns on their investments. Traders cover the capital gains or losses for other protocol users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that’s not necessarily enough to make sure that the Angle protocol remains over-collaterized. That’s why there is a third type of agents in the Angle protocol. People will be able to provide liquidity and accumulate interests on their deposits. Those deposits also act as collateral assets for the protocol.</p>
<p>The result is a sophisticated over-collaterized protocol that isn’t limited to EUR stablecoins — it could work with many different kind of underlying assets. The team will be starting with two new crypto assets, a EUR stablecoin and a USD stablecoin — agEUR and agUSD. They’ll be redeemable against a handful of collaterals and you can expect to see support for those assets in other DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>But Angle Labs already has plans to launch other stablecoins pegged to the Swiss Franc, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen or the Korean Won. The protocol is currently being tested and has been audited by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime. If things go well, Angle should go live on the mainnet in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rizefs.com/">Rize</a>, a fintech-as-a-service company that provides services to other firms, announced an $11.4 million Series A this morning. The funding event was led by <a href="https://www.alphaedison.com/">Alpha Edison</a> and <a href="https://morpheus.com/">Morpheus Ventures</a>. A number of the startup&#8217;s prior backers also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Rize is an interesting company in a competitive space; the market for building financial technology products for use by customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/swan-raises-18-7-million-to-provide-embedded-banking-services/">enjoys a great</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/solarisbank-raises-224m-at-a-1-65b-valuation-to-acquire-contis-and-expand-its-api-based-embedded-banking-tech-in-europe/">number of players</a>. Rize hopes to compete by allowing its customers to leverage a single API for more than one account type, unifying its offering to a single developer hook.</p>
<p>More importantly, Rize has built something that it calls &#8220;synthetic accounts.&#8221; For those of us who last heard the word &#8220;synthetic&#8221; in a financial context attached to the phrase &#8220;CDO,&#8221; this may sound concerning. It&#8217;s not. Instead, synthetic accounts allow Rize to provide customers of its banking services a way to create a unified account for end users not tied to a single custodial account type. In practice, synthetic accounts allow Rize to offer end users (the customers of its customers) the ability to combine different custodial accounts (checking, brokerage) into a single experience.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:9564f49f-8d38-4c52-b26c-54667a3eb5d8">white paper from Rize</a>, by offering a single &#8220;synthetic account core,&#8221; its customers can create a more cohesive and programmable financial experience for end users. And the synthetic account system will allow Rize customers to add more services to their financial technology offerings as Rize itself expands its feature set.</p>
<p>Morpheus Ventures&#8217; Howard Ko brought up the company&#8217;s synthetic account work in a statement to TechCrunch, saying that it was that feature of its service that &#8220;attracted&#8221; his firm to the startup, as it &#8220;essentially abstracts all the plumbing required to develop a broad spectrum of fintech products and services that developers are looking to build into a simplified singular API connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with senior leadership, Rize told TechCrunch that it has built a compliance management system into its product, likening compliance work to logistics in the e-commerce world &#8212; something critical that is both complicated and not a task that folks relish taking on. Rize wants to alleviate a chunk of that burden, potentially smoothing the path for businesses to select its offering over those of rival banking-as-a-service players.</p>
<p>Rize has completed the core banking pieces of its product &#8212; the startup we see today is the result of a B2B pivot from B2C roots &#8212; with brokerage support coming next. New capital should help the company expand its product mix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Rize&#8217;s leadership told TechCrunch that it wound up raising its Series A earlier than it anticipated. The startup had expected slower market traction, it said, but greater-than-anticipated demand meant that Rize had larger human capital needs. So, external funds were the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Rize executed its B2B pivot with a team of around 15, expanding to just over 30 today. The company expects to have nearly 50 staff by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be consolidation in the banking-as-a-service, or BaaS, space. But we likely won&#8217;t see that wave crest until there&#8217;s less white space for startups to eat into. And by the time that that occurs, startups like Rize will hope to be on the acquiring side of the equation. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Rize can scale both customer and revenue volume with this Series A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.runx.dev/">RunX</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to deploy cloud infrastructure, announced a $4.1 million seed investment led by Unusual Ventures and a group of individual angel investors.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ankur Dahiya says that as organizations deploy modern applications built on microservices and Kubernetes, the complexity in managing cloud resources has grown. His company is attempting to build a solution to simplify all of the aspects related to managing those cloud resources, a capability that is currently only within reach of the largest software companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company&#8217;s goal has been to give every company the same kind of infrastructure leverage as the tech giants like Google and Facebook, but without needing to invest in a giant infrastructure DevOps team,&#8221; Dahiya told me.</p>
<p>Dahiya spent 4 years at Flexport, while his co-founder CTO Nitin Aggarwal, spent time at Google, Lyft and Stripe. Both come from a background managing engineering teams and helping their organizations manage cloud infrastructure, so they have seen this problem first hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we automate a bunch of the DevOps work involved in Kubernetes. So that&#8217;s your provisioning, monitoring, configuration, auto scaling and deployment. For all of that stuff, we have connected it together to make it like an out-of-the-box experience,&#8221; he said. The company does allow developers to tweak that out-of-the-box configuration if they wish, but they have found that for the most part, companies can use the standard configurations because they apply to the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>For starters, it has an open source offering called <a href="https://github.com/run-x/opta/">Opta</a>, and RunX is working with about a dozen beta/design partners. It eventually will charge for a product, but what shape that will take is still being worked out, probably an enterprise version with extra security built in, a cloud service or some combination.</p>
<p>The startup launched a year ago and the founders spent several months talking to developers before they began building the first version of the product in January, which they completed in the spring and began working with early companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company has 8 employees and the plan is to double that number by the end of next year. Like most technical startups finding employees, especially competent engineers is a challenge, but the company is attempting to build a diverse and inclusive startup nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early on it&#8217;s extra hard. Most of the early people we&#8217;ve gotten from our networks. They were folks I worked with, folks in a closed network. It skews toward archetype, so it&#8217;s been a bit of a struggle,&#8221; he said. That said, he recognizes the importance of building a more diverse team and it&#8217;s something he&#8217;s working on as he recruits for open positions moving forward.</p>
<p>Right now the company is remote, and the plan is to continue that way, although once a quarter they are trying to fly everyone to one location for brainstorming, team building activities and shared meals, but he recognizes this could be more challenging as they grow. He&#8217;s thinking about hiring around hubs where people can meet more regularly, but it&#8217;s still something he and Agrawal are working out.,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the growth of ecommerce has left us browsing and shopping more than ever, that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re actually buying all that much. In fact, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">the Baymard Institute, as cited by Shopify, says</a> that about 70 percent of shopping carts are abandoned on desktop, with that number only going up on mobile and tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://addtocarrot.com/">Carrot</a>, the latest venture out of Bobby Ghoshal and his cofounder Ramin Bozorgzadeh, is looking to make a dent in that number.</p>
<p>Carrot is a plug-in that saves the stuff you&#8217;ve put in your cart and automatically categorizes it.</p>
<p>The company is announcing the close of a $5.5 million seed round with investors that include Kindred Ventures, M13, Abstract, Designer Fund, Combine, Paris Hilton, Scott Belsky, Riverpark, and Nextview.</p>
<p>The &#8216;special sauce&#8217; of Carrot is the product&#8217;s ability to capture what you&#8217;ve put in your cart without any additional buttons or signals, regardless of the retailer. The tech captures the action of add to cart and saves that information in the plug-in, including price and retailer.</p>
<p>Carrot automatically categorizes carts based on the retailer itself, but also allows users to create their own folders. Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;re shopping for lamps across a handful of different retailers. You can create a lamps folder and compare prices and looks within Carrot.</p>
<p>The product also tracks pricing changes for items in a cart, giving users the chance to see when something goes on sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Carrot, users can create registries to send to their friends and family. The registry product is more of an extension of Carrot&#8217;s main use case, and hasn&#8217;t been built out as a full feature, yet. In other words, if you send a page of wish list items to your friends and family, there is no indication to them that someone bought one item or another, meaning you could end up with duplicates. But the team says they&#8217;re working on that functionality in the near future.</p>
<p>Ghoshal is a serial founder. He cofounded Candid, which raised over $150 million, and was head of design and growth at WeWork. Bozorgzadeh, for his part, was a founding engineer at WeWork, head of engineering at WeWork Labs, and an early engineer at Etsy.</p>
<p>Right now, Carrot is only available on desktop, but the company has provided a way for mobile shoppers to still save their carts. Ghoshal says that feedback from customers revealed that people wanted to text items to their cart, using a number provided by Carrot. The idea was that users were already texting themselves items they wanted to buy later.</p>
<p>Carrot makes money using an affiliate model, where the retailer pays out to Carrot for each customer that checks out after their first session.</p>
<p>Eventually, Carrot has plans to get into a SaaS model where brands can pay a monthly fee for access to features like competitive bidding and audience profiling. The team is also working on a single check-out option across multiple charts, which would generate revenue through interchange fees, etc. That said, revenue is not a priority for the company right now, as the focus is on scale.</p>
<p>Ghoshal sees the top challenges for the company being around scale, including getting people to talk about the way they&#8217;re using Carrot and sharing it with their friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there are probably some platform challenges on Google that we need to think about,&#8221; said Ghoshal. &#8220;Ideally, we&#8217;d get featured on Google, but we don&#8217;t know if they intend to get into the space. There&#8217;s some risk there that we need to think about.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The robotic process automation (RPA) market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">has been red hot</a> over the last year, and one of the market&#8217;s pioneers, <a href="http://blueprism.com">Blue Prism,</a> was sold to <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> for £1.095 billion ($1.5 billion USD), according to <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-blue-prism-group-plc/15151094">a filing</a> in Great Britain this morning. While we have seen a lot of RPA startups being acquired by larger vendors over the last year, this is the first deal involving one of the top three vendors in the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complex deal in which Vista set up an entity called Bali Bidco Limited &#8212; which, according to the filing, is indirectly owned by Vista Funds &#8212; to make the purchase on its behalf. While it&#8217;s unclear why it used that financial mechanism, the end result is the private equity group is buying Blue Prism and folding it into another Vista property, <a href="http://tibco.com">Tibco</a>, which<a href="https://www.tibco.com/press-releases/2014/tibco-be-acquired-vista-equity-partners-2400-share-cash"> the firm acquired in 2014</a> for $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Blue Prism, by its own admission in the filing, was facing tough times and has been exploring its options since its annual general meeting last March. &#8220;The Blue Prism Board has considered a range of strategic options given the strategic and operational headwinds facing the company, the significant risks in execution and the shareholder consultation feedback,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>
<p>One of those options was a sale, which it decided was the best approach for the company. Jason Kingdon, chairman and CEO at Blue Prism, sees this as the best path to put it on more solid footing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining with Vista and Tibco will ensure we remain at the forefront of the next generation of intelligent automation: We can expand the range of products we offer our customers, with Tibco&#8217;s global footprint and technologies; and, as a privately owned company, we will also have greater access to capital to pursue new growth opportunities via product investment and other potential M&amp;A,&#8221; Kingdon said in a statement.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="C3IvnkcqOY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/">Private equity firms can offer enterprise startups a viable exit option</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firms can offer enterprise startups a viable exit option&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/private-equity-firms-can-offer-enterprise-startups-a-viable-exit-option/embed/#?secret=C3IvnkcqOY" data-secret="C3IvnkcqOY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>We dug into Blue Prism’s historical operating results to better understand its decision to sell. In the six months ending April 30, 2021, the company reported £80.4 million (approximately $108 million USD) worth of revenue, a figure that was up 24% compared to the year-ago period on a constant-currency basis. Over the same time horizon, Blue Prism reduced its operating loss from £53.8 million (approximately $73 million USD) to £20.9 million (approximately $30 million USD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was not growing particularly quickly for its level of unprofitability, despite making progress in stemming red ink. The value of Blue Prism had fallen before the deal was announced, indicating that public investors were unenthused with its performance; Vista is paying a premium for the company through Bidco, though less than what Blue Prism was worth earlier this year, before its most recent declines.</p>
<p>If you look at the company’s H1 2021 revenue and extrapolate that over a year, Blue Prism is selling for around 6.8x revenues. This is a useful figure because it indicates what the exit value of public software revenues may be in the European market from a company that is growing as slowly as Blue Prism is. Vista appears confident that the purchase and combination with Tibco will prove lucrative.</p>
<p>While Tibco, a legacy vendor founded in 1997, offers a broad range of automation services to connect data sources across a company, Blue Prism offers robotic process automation services, which help automate a set of mundane legacy tasks across an organization. The two should fit well together, at least on paper, as Blue Prism gives Tibco a leg up on the growing RPA market.</p>
<p>Last year, Gartner reported that the top three vendors in this space included UIPath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">a company that went public last year</a> to great fanfare, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism. In a report last year, IDC estimated that the RPA market would reach $2 billion this year, a modest amount considering the hype circulating around it, but one which IDC expects to reach $5.9 billion by 2024.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of consolidation in the industry, with smaller companies being purchased by larger ones over the last year. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/">Salesforce bought German startup</a> Servicetrace and combined it with Mulesoft, which is a similar kind of move to Vista buying Blue Prism and folding it into Tibco. Mulesoft and Tibco could be considered competitors.</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to Blue Prism shareholder approval, as well as the standard regulatory process. Blue Prism stock is off 2.12% on the news.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Companies use data to build models that they use to automate decisions, but without visibility, it’s difficult to determine if the models are accountable, fair and responsible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://arize.com/">Arize AI</a> is applying machine learning to some of technology’s toughest problems. To continue with its mission, the company announced $19 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Battery Ventures led the round with participation from existing investors Foundation Capital, Trinity Ventures, The House Fund and Swift Ventures. The new round comes over a year after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">came out of stealth with $4 million in seed funding</a> led by Foundation Capital.</p>
<p>Arize was co-founded by CEO Jason Lopatecki, a former TubeMogul executive, and chief product officer Aparna Dhinakaran, who previously built machine learning infrastructure at Uber and  joined the company when Arize acquired her company Monitor ML, where she was CEO.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/">TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TubeMogul, Uber alums launch Arize AI for AI observability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/tubemogul-execs-launch-arize-ai-for-ai-troublehsooting/embed/#?secret=u2WE9D0yRY" data-secret="u2WE9D0yRY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company touts itself as “the first ML observability platform to help make machine learning models work in production.” Its technology monitors, explains and troubleshoots model and data issues.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the year, we talked to hundreds of businesses deploying machine learning and having the same problems,” Lopatecki told TechCrunch. “Most of their investment was going into building better models and getting them out, but no one had any software to help with the issues.”</p>
<p>Companies use data to build models that they use to automate decisions, but without visibility to see if the models are working or not, it’s difficult to determine if the models are accountable, fair and responsible when implemented in the real world, Dhinakaran added. Arize can be integrated into a company’s AI systems within 30 days to detect performance and bias issues and show customers how to fix it.</p>
<p>Between its seed and Series A rounds, the company secured enterprise customers like Adobe and Twilio. It also scaled its team and went from building a product to having it “massively deployed” in fintech, healthcare, insurtech, adtech and retail institutions.</p>
<p>The opportunity for the Series A came as the company was inundated, Lopatecki said.</p>
<p>“Being a second-time founder, you can feel when the product is taking off, and for us, we could spot where we have that influxsion,” he added. “We want to double down on the product side and get the solution out to more people and get it into more hands.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As such, the funding will go into product development, expanding industries and use cases and growing its team of 40. He expects to double that quickly, especially as the company continues to see 100% annual recurring revenue growth each quarter and a doubling of its customer base.</p>
<p>Dhinakaran forecasts that in five years, Arize’s technology will be deployed into every AI system.</p>
<p>“Every single top machine learning team is going to have that visibility on if their model is doing well and if it is unbiased,” she added. “It’s not just a red or green light of modeling, but enabling practitioners to serve up issues and fix them.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Dharmesh Thakker, general partner at Battery Ventures, is joining the Arize AI board. His firm mainly invests in business-to-business software, and Thakker, in particular, oversees infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>Every three months, the firm picks a new theme. In this case, his team had heard from portfolio companies that there wasn’t the tooling available for deploying models and monitoring them. They looked at about nine companies, including Arize, and the more they got to know the company, they decided it had the best vision and leadership.</p>
<p>He sees the future of machine learning observability being a combination of a well-designed product and instant gratification. Customers don’t want to wait, and even though another company might have all the features, because Arize AI focuses on observability and can quickly show value and vision is what makes them stand out.</p>
<p>“Being an engineer myself, I look for founders that have felt the same pain, and in this case, Jason and Aparna have felt the pain because observability was missing,” Thakker added. “We also look for leaders who can hire great people. Not only do they feel the pain, but they rallied this A-plus team around them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not every country has a Multiple Listing Service to aid in buying and selling a home. This often makes the process complicated as buyers weed through fake and duplicate listings and little pricing data, unlike in the United States.</p>
<p>Property technology startup <a href="https://nomadhomes.co/">Nomad Homes</a> is working to change that by creating a personalized real estate buying experience in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, a region that represents $20 trillion in real estate, company CEO Helen Chen told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are like Stitch Fix for real estate,” she added. “We are matching you to the best home for you. Instead of searching the old way by going through thousands of listings, you can take a &#8216;style quiz,&#8217; and we match you with properties.”</p>

<p>Today, Nomad Homes announced a $20 million Series A funding co-led by 01 Advisors, an investment fund co-founded by former Twitter executives Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, and The Spruce House Partnership. There was also a group of new and existing investors that participated, including Goodwater Capital, HighSage Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Partech, Class 5 Global, Precursor Ventures and Alta Park Capital.</p>
<p>Angel investors in the round included co-founder and former CEO of Zillow and Pacaso Spencer Rascoff through his firm 75 &amp; Sunny, Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, former Compass COO/CFO David Snider, Flyhomes CEO Tushar Garg, Landis co-founders Cyril Berdugo and Tom Petit and DST Global partner Saurabh Gupta.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $24 million since Chen, Dan Piehler and Damien Drap started the company in 2019 after bonding over finding a place to live in a new city. They have collective backgrounds in Blackstone, Addepar and Uber, while Chen also left the Stanford Graduate School of Business to start the company.</p>
<p>Nomad Homes is creating its own MLS for the region and applies technology to the expertise provided by local customer services experts to provide home buyers with all of the information they need, from the initial search to financing and signing all of the documents.</p>

<p>“Nomad Homes has built an incredible platform that is shaping the future of real estate across EMEA,” said Dick Costolo, managing partner of 01 Advisors, in a written statement. “What the team is building is increasing market liquidity and simplifying the consumer experience. We have invested in similarly transformative companies in the U.S. and are excited to partner with these founders and the entire team as they expand.”</p>
<p>After announcing its launch and seed round in 2020, the company’s platform is now online in Paris and Dubai. It is expanding into Southern Europe and building out its team in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>As transaction volumes grew over 16 times through the first half of the year, the Series A was an opportunity to accelerate into new markets and heavily invest in the technology and product to improve the experience for customers, Chen said. A portion of the proceeds will also go toward fintech products and doubling its team of 32 by year-end.</p>
<p>“We will continue to deliver the best customer experience and expand our offerings across more markets,” she added. “We are also excited about all of the investors around the table. They are multistage investors, and we have a tremendous amount to learn from them, especially Spencer from Zillow and Eric from Opendoor, who are both experts in the space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, which has a network of data centers in 250 locations around the world, announced its first dalliance with infrastructure services today, an upcoming cloud storage offering called R2.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince, says that the idea for moving into storage as a service came from the same place as other ideas the company has turned into products. It was something they needed in-house and that led to them building it for themselves, before offering it to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we build products, the reason that we end up building them is usually because we need them ourselves,&#8221; Prince told me. He said that the storage component grew out of the need to store object components like images on the company&#8217;s network. Once they built it, and they looked around at the cloud storage landscape, they decided that it would make sense to offer it as a product to customers too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought if we can build a storage solution that provides all the functionality that other storage solutions do, that takes advantage of our global network so it&#8217;s extremely performant and we can also then price it in a way that is very attractive to customers [we should do it],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The R2 name is a little swipe at Amazon&#8217;s S3 storage product and obviously a play on the name. The difference, according to Prince, is that they have found a way to reduce storage costs by up to 10% by eliminating egress fees. Cloudflare plans to price storage at $0.015 per GB of data stored per month. That compares with S3 pricing that starts at $0.023 per GB for the first 50 TB per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In terms of what costs look like in terms of data transfer costs, if you look at any of the cloud providers it&#8217;s free to put your data in, but it costs you something to pull that data back out,&#8221; Prince told me. He said one of the goals with this service was eliminating those costs associated with moving the data around, and the plan is to not charge for what the company called &#8220;infrequent access.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince sees this against a backdrop where the price of bandwidth has fallen over the years, yet the price of storage on Amazon and other cloud services has remained high. In his estimation, they can pass on some of those cost savings to customers. He says that he&#8217;s not trying to compete directly with startups like Backblaze and Wasabi, both of which he says are partners, but both are similarly trying to compete with Amazon and other large cloud providers in the cloud storage market.</p>
<p>The product is still being developed and the company has set up a waitlist for customers interested in participating in a beta when it&#8217;s ready for testing in the coming months.</p>
<p>Prince says that Cloudflare is looking at building other services beyond storage, and he sees his company eventually competing with the big three cloud vendors &#8212; AWS, Google and Microsoft. &#8220;I think that we really think we&#8217;re on the path to be the fourth major public cloud. And, and I think that our approach to it is actually much more differentiated than the other three, and so yeah, we will continue to build things out,&#8221; he said.</p>
