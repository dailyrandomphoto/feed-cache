										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://kalepa.com/">Kalepa</a>, an insurance underwriting platform based out of New York, has raised a $14 million Series A funding round led by Inspired Capital, with participation from previous investor IA Ventures. Also participating was Gokul Rajaram of Doordash, Coinbase, and formerly of Google, Jackie Reses, formerly of Square, and Henry Ward of Carta.</p>
<p>Founded by Paul Monasterio and Daniel Hillman, the startup was launched in 2018 aimed at commercial insurance underwriters.</p>
<p>Co-Founder and CEO, Paul Monasterio said: “InsureTech has seen a massive evolution over the past decade, but commercial insurance—which supports hard-working business owners and protects their most important assets—has been left behind. We leverage billions of data points and unlock crucial insights in order to bring businesses and insurers a single version of the truth.”</p>
<p>Kalepa says its Copilot software automatically learns what the best underwriters are doing, allowing an underwriter to take a more accurate underwriting decision as quickly as possible vs. simply aggregating a lot of data for them. It competes with the legacy MGAs (e.g., RT Specialty, AmWins) as well as new entrants such as Pathpoint in the E&amp;S market.</p>
<p>Penny Pritzker, co-founder at Inspired Capital and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce said: “Commercial insurance represents a $1T industry globally and helps 30 million U.S. businesses. Kalepa has brought some of the sharpest minds in understanding risk to this segment of the insurance market.”</p>
<p>Veteran insurance player Mario Vitale is also joining Kalepa’s Board.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s an old startup adage that goes: Cash is king. I’m not sure that is true anymore.</p>
<p>In today’s cash rich environment, options are more valuable than cash. Founders have many guides on how to raise money, but not enough has been written about how to protect your startup’s option pool. As a founder, recruiting talent is the most important factor for success. In turn, managing your option pool may be the most effective action you can take to ensure you can recruit and retain talent.</p>
<p>That said, managing your option pool is no easy task. However, with some foresight and planning, it’s possible to take advantage of certain tools at your disposal and avoid common pitfalls.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mechanics of the option pool over multiple funding rounds.</li>
<li>Common pitfalls that trip up founders along the way.</li>
<li>What you can do to protect your option pool or to correct course if you made mistakes early on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A minicase study on option pool mechanics</h2>
<p>Let’s run through a quick case study that sets the stage before we dive deeper. In this example, there are three equal co-founders who decide to quit their jobs to become startup founders.</p>
<p>Since they know they need to hire talent, the trio gets going with a 10% option pool at inception. They then cobble together enough money across angel, pre-seed and seed rounds (with 25% cumulative dilution across those rounds) to achieve product-market fit (PMF). With PMF in the bag, they raise a Series A, which results in a further 25% dilution.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The easiest way to ensure you don’t run out of options too quickly is simply to start with a bigger pool.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>After hiring a few C-suite executives, they are now running low on options. So at the Series B, the company does a 5% option pool top-up pre-money — in addition to giving up 20% in equity related to the new cash injection. When the Series C and D rounds come by with dilutions of 15% and 10%, the company has hit its stride and has an imminent IPO in the works. Success!</p>
<p>For simplicity, I will assume a few things that don’t normally happen but will make illustrating the math here a bit easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>No investor participates in their pro-rata after their initial investment.</li>
<li>Half the available pool is issued to new hires and/or used for refreshes every round.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, every situation is unique and your mileage may vary. But this is a close enough proxy to what happens to a lot of startups in practice. Here is what the available option pool will look like over time across rounds:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png" alt="Option pool example" width="1024" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png 2031w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=768,303 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=680,268 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=1536,606 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Figure-1.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allen Miller</p></div></p>
<p>Note how quickly the pool thins out — especially early on. In the beginning, 10% sounds like a lot, but it’s hard to make the first few hires when you have nothing to show the world and no cash to pay salaries. In addition, early rounds don’t just dilute your equity as a founder, they dilute everyone&#8217;s — including your option pool (both allocated and unallocated). By the time the company raises its Series B, the available pool is already less than 1.5%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in July, <a href="https://www.yasa.com/">YASA</a> (formerly Yokeless And Segmented Armature), a British electric motor startup with a revolutionary &#8216;axial-flux&#8217; motor, was acquired by Mercedes-Benz. The acquisition didn’t exactly garner enormous press attention, as scant other details were announced. But YASA is likely to be an entity worth watching.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 after being spun out of Oxford University, YASA will now develop ultra-high-performance electric motors for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG.EA electric-only platform. It will stay in the UK as a fully owned subsidiary, serving both Mercedes-Benz and existing customers like Ferrari. The company will retain its own brand, team, facilities, and location in Oxford.</p>
<p>YASA&#8217;s axial-flux electric motors generated EV industry interest because of their efficiency, high power density, small size, and low weight.</p>
<p>By contrast, the &#8216;radial&#8217; electric motor design is more common in today’s EV market. Even Tesla relies on radial electric motors, a legacy technology more than 40 years old with very little left to give in terms of innovation.</p>
<p>But YASA’s axial-flux design, which has very thin segments, means they can be combined into powerful single drive units. This makes them one-third the weight of other electric motors, more efficient, and with 3x higher power densities than Tesla.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/timwoolmer">Tim Woolmer</a>, YASA’s Founder and CTO, invented this very new approach to electric motor design. I caught up with him to find out what’s next.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What’s the journey so far:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started just over 12 years ago with really one remit: let&#8217;s accelerate electric cars, let&#8217;s do anything we can to make electric cars happen faster. We&#8217;re now 10 years into a 20-year revolution, every new car that gets sold in 10 years will be electric, no question. There&#8217;s nothing more exciting for an engineer than a period of revolution because the speed of innovation is what&#8217;s important. What is so exciting for us is we get to innovate fast, and that&#8217;s where the partnership with Mercedes is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What was different about the engine you came up with?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We started with a blank sheet of paper at the beginning of my PhD. And the idea was to say, what could be created for the electric car industry in 10 or 15 years from now that they would need, that we could meet. Something that was lighter, more efficient, mass-producible in volume. In the 2000s, axial flux motors were not very common, but by combining axial flux technology and making a couple of little tweaks using some new materials, I basically stumbled into this new design which we call YASA: Yokeless And Segmented Armature. It takes what is a light topology in axial flux and makes it even lighter, about half as much again. There&#8217;s a benefit because the rotors are rotating at a bigger diameter. So, essentially torque is force times diameter, so for the same force, you get more torque. So if you double your diameter, you get double the torque for the same amount of materials. So that&#8217;s the benefit of axial flux.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: You’ve done this with deal with Mercedes &#8211; what’s next?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We are basically a fully owned subsidiary. We&#8217;re going to utilize Mercedes’ industrialization powerhouse. But the key thing is, if you watch how technologies filter down in automotive, they start in the luxury sector, like the Ferraris of this world, and then filter down into mainstream sector and then go into higher volumes after that. That&#8217;s a space where Mercedes are world-class in terms of their industrialization, so that&#8217;s the kind of the idea behind the partnership.</p>
<p><strong>TC</strong>: What else can you do from here?</p>
<p><strong>TW</strong>: We will have a very high, high power, low density and lightweight engine so we can explore sport performance coupled with high levels of industrialization. That puts us in a really unique position for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Although coy about his future plans, Woolmer is certainly one to watch in the EV and electric motor space. Post the acquisition YASA released this video:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram made headlines (including this one) when product head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/">said in June</a> that the app is &#8220;no longer just a square photo-sharing app,&#8221; since it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/after-testing-instagram-launches-ads-in-the-instagram-shop-tab-globally/">pivoting its focus</a> to shopping and video. But where does that leave photographers who want a social photo-sharing experience?</p>
<p>According to Tom Watson, a former product designer at Facebook and Pinterest, photographers have lacked a social network for a while. That&#8217;s why, with co-founder Stefan Borsje, Watson built Glass, a subscription-based iOS app designed to be a home for photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved photography, and when Flickr got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/23/flickrs-acquisition-9-years-later/">bought by Yahoo</a>, it was a sad moment for me. I love that kind of nerdy photography community,&#8221; Watson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Then you started to see it pick up with Instagram to take the torch into the mobile space. But I was at Facebook when Facebook purchased Instagram, and you could kind of see that it would inevitably be where it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those of us accustomed to free, ad-supported social media, it might feel unfamiliar to pay a monthly fee for an app. Glass costs $4.99 a month (or $29.99 a year) to use, but you can try it without charge for 14 days. Still, the app takes your App Store payment info right away, so it could be a barrier to entry for people who worry they won&#8217;t remember to delete Glass before the trial period ends, should they not want to continue with it. But this model is intentional. Watson and Borsje are specifically trying to build their app &#8212; which only has five team members &#8212; without any venture funding or ad revenue. They only want to have to answer to their community of photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do something different and start with a social subscription model and to bootstrap without venture capital,&#8221; said Watson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen in the past what happens when you take on venture capital and go for the moon. You keep pivoting away from your photographer community in order to become more broad.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=2048,1174 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collageglass.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197793" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Glass</p></div></p>
<p>From the moment you open the Glass app, it&#8217;s clear that the emphasis is on the photography itself. When you follow photographers, their posts will appear in a feed of images designed to minimize distractions. The photos take up the entire screen, and you can only see who posted them if you drag them to the right. When you click on an image, you can see its caption and other information about how the photograph was shot. You can engage socially through comments, but there aren&#8217;t likes on photos &#8212; this is an intentional design choice, though Watson says some users are asking for a like button, even if it just helps them bookmark images for later browsing. In the coming weeks, Glass will launch<a href="https://glass.photo/updates/glimpse-into-glass"> discovery features</a>, like categories for photographs. Glass also has a feedback board, which allows users to request features and upvote or downvote other users&#8217; ideas. If Glass chooses to develop a suggestion, it is noted as &#8220;in progress&#8221; on the board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though it&#8217;s only in its beginning stages, Glass already sets itself apart from Instagram or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/inside-vsco-a-gen-z-approved-photo-sharing-app-with-ceo-joel-flory/">VSCO</a> by offering EXIF data, which is like candy for the &#8220;photography nerds&#8221; that Glass hopes to attract. EXIF data shows what camera a photographer used, as well as the photo&#8217;s ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. This data and sense of community was what drew people to Flickr in its early days, but when Yahoo gave free users up to one terrabyte of data, it became more of a personal archive than a community. Then, when SmugMug bought Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, it tried to backpedal by only allowing free users to have 1000 photos, warning that they could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/flickr-revamps-under-smugmug-with-new-limits-on-free-accounts-unlimited-storage-for-pros/">delete free users&#8217; photos</a> if they didn&#8217;t upgrade to a paid plan.</p>
<p>Glass also appeals to photographers by allowing for a wider variety of image sizes on the app &#8212; the maximum aspect ratio is 16 x 9, which accommodates the size of standard camera photos. But on Instagram, even after the platform moved away from its square image motif, it&#8217;s not possible to post vertical photographs from most cameras without cropping them. Like VSCO, Glass doesn&#8217;t show how many followers each user has, though you can see comments. While you can&#8217;t see how many followers someone else has, you can see who is following your own account.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought that was important for safety. If someone follows you, you need to know who that is, and to be able to block them,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;We really wanted to build blocking and reporting features from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Watson declined to share how many users have downloaded the app so far, but Watson said he&#8217;s &#8220;extremely happy with the response&#8221; to Glass. It launched with a waitlist in August, and Wednesday the app opened up to all iOS users. The goal of the waitlist wasn&#8217;t to generate hype, but rather, to make sure that the user experience remained smooth, and that the app wouldn&#8217;t get overloaded. At the time of the app&#8217;s waitlist launch in August, Watson told TechCrunch that Glass was sending hundreds of invites out every day. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the internet a long time, and I used to feel like there was a cozier, safer space,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;I hope that by having this subscription model, these spaces can feel that way a little bit more again.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1b3ba3cf-fb54-46b3-b9a6-7c8307897784?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> gathered to dig through the week&#8217;s biggest happenings, including some news of our own. As a note, Equity&#8217;s Monday episode will be landing next <em>Tuesday, </em>thanks to a national holiday here in the United States. And we have something special planned for Wednesday, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Ok! Here&#8217;s the rundown from the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apollo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">completed its takeover of <del>Verizon Media Group</del> Yahoo</a>: Yep, we have new bosses, and we have feelings about it. But mostly the TechCrunch news was a useful segue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/">Drift&#8217;s majority exit to Vista Equity Partners</a> at a price that made the Boston-based startup a unicorn. Terms were not disclosed, sadly, but Drift&#8217;s revenues looked strong going into the transaction. That left us with questions.</li>
<li>Then we chatted about Databricks, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">raised a small country&#8217;s GDP in a single funding round this week</a>, valuing the data-and-ML company at a staggering $38 billion valuation. Why isn&#8217;t Databricks going public? Because it doesn&#8217;t have to, mostly.</li>
<li>Hum Capital believes the future of startup fundraising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/hum-capital-thinks-the-future-of-funding-is-a-return-to-old-school-wall-street/">requires a return to old school Wall Street. </a>The startup helps founders and investors navigate the overly fragmented market these days, and just raised millions to scale this service.</li>
<li>Form there we dug into two IPOs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">including the very interesting story of Toast</a>, another Boston-based company, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/business/allbirds-ipo.html">and AllBirds</a>. The AllBirds offering was less exciting from a numerical perspective, though Natasha and Alex both like their shoes from the company.</li>
<li>And to close out, we discussed how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/compounds-foods-brews-up-4-5m-to-make-coffee-without-beans/">Compound Foods wants to save the planet</a> by making coffee sans beans. Which we are willing to try as soon as we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s a wrap from us for the week! Keep your head atop your shoulders and have a great weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://www.playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a> wants to become the TikTok for games. The company&#8217;s newly launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">iOS app</a> offers tools that allow users to make and share simple games on their phone, as well as a vertically scrollable, fullscreen feed where you can play the games created by others. Also like TikTok, the feed becomes more personalized over time to serve up more of the kinds of games you like to play.</p>
<p>While typically, game creation involves some aspect of coding, Playbyte&#8217;s games are created using simple building blocks, emoji and even images from your Camera Roll on your iPhone. The idea is to make building games just another form of self-expression, rather than some introductory, educational experience that&#8217;s trying to teach users the basics of coding.</p>
<p>At its core, Playbyte&#8217;s game creation is powered by its lightweight 2D game engine built on web frameworks, which lets users create games that can be quickly loaded and played even on slow connections and older devices. After you play a game, you can like and comment using buttons on the right-side of the screen, which also greatly resembles the TikTok look-and-feel. Over time, Playbyte&#8217;s feed shows you more of the games you enjoyed as the app leverages its understanding of in-game imagery, tags and descriptions, and other engagement analytics to serve up more games it believes you&#8217;ll find compelling.</p>
<p>At launch, users have already made a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@team_playbyte?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">variety of games</a> using Playbyte&#8217;s tools &#8212; including simulators, tower defense games, combat challenges, obbys, murder mystery games, and more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We made an app called Playbyte that lets you make games on your phone, discover games made by other users, and challenge your friends <a href="https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls">https://t.co/FFnMbKG1ls</a> <a href="https://t.co/eqhabN3kM1">pic.twitter.com/eqhabN3kM1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Playbyte (@PlaybyteInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc/status/1397259875076481029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Playbyte founder and CEO Kyle Russell &#8212; previously of Skydio, Andreessen Horowitz, and (disclosure!) TechCrunch &#8212; Playbyte is meant to be a social media app, not just a games app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this model in our minds for what is required to build a new social media platform,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>What Twitter did for text, Instagram did for photos and TikTok did for video was to combine a constraint with a personalized feed, Russell explains. &#8220;Typically. [they started] with a focus on making these experiences really brief&#8230;So a short, constrained format and dedicated tools that set you up for success to work within that constrained format,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Similarly, Playbyte games have their own set of limitations. In addition to their simplistic nature, the games are limited to five scenes. Thanks to this constraint, a format has emerged where people are making games that have an intro screen where you hit &#8220;play,&#8221; a story intro, a challenging gameplay section, and then a story outro.</p>
<p>In addition to its easy-to-use game building tools, Playbyte also allows game assets to be reused by other game creators. That means if someone who has more expertise makes a game asset using custom logic or which pieced together multiple components, the rest of the user base can benefit from that work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, we want to make it really easy for people who aren&#8217;t as ambitious to still feel like productive, creative game makers,&#8221; says Russell. &#8220;The key to that is going to be if you have an idea &#8212; like an image of a game in your mind &#8212; you should be able to very quickly search for new assets or piece together other ones you&#8217;ve previously saved. And then just drop them in and mix-and-match &#8212; almost like Legos &#8212; and construct something that&#8217;s 90% of what you imagined, without any further configuration on your part,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In time, Playbyte plans to monetize its feed with brand advertising, perhaps by allowing creators to drop sponsored assets into their games, for instance. It also wants to establish some sort of patronage model at a later point. This could involve either subscriptions or even NFTs of the games, but this would be further down the road.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup had originally began as a web app in 2019, but at the end of last year, the team scrapped that plan and rewrote everything as a native iOS app with its own game engine. That app launched on the App Store this week, after previously maxing out TestFlight&#8217;s cap of 10,000 users.</p>
<p>Currently, it&#8217;s finding traction with younger teenagers who are active on TikTok and other collaborative games, like Roblox, Minecraft, or Fortnite.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are young people who feel inspired to build their own games but have been intimidated by the need to learn to code or use other advanced tools, or who simply don&#8217;t have a computer at home that would let them access those tools,&#8221; notes Russell.</p>
<p>Playbyte is backed by $4 million in pre-seed and seed funding from investors including FirstMark (Rick Heitzmann), Ludlow Ventures (Jonathon Triest and Blake Robbins), Dream Machine (former Editor-in-Chief at TechCrunch, Alexia Bonatsos), and angels such as Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; Nate Mitchell, co-founder of Oculus; Ashita Achuthan, previously of Twitter; and others.</p>
<p>The app is a free download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playbyte/id1551822717">on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p>The barrier to entry for launching hardware startups has fallen; if you can pull off a successful crowdfunding campaign, you&#8217;re likely savvy enough to find a factory overseas that can build your widgets to spec.</p>
<p>But global supply chains are fragile: No one expected an off-course container ship to block the Suez Canal for six days. Due to the pandemic, importers are paying almost $18,000 for shipping containers from China today that cost $3,300 a year ago.</p>
<p>After spending a career spinning up supply chains on three continents, Liteboxer CEO Jeff Morin authored a guide for Extra Crunch for hardware founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re clear-eyed about the challenges and apply some rigor and forethought to the process, the end result can be hard to match,&#8221; Morin says.</p>

<p>Few people thought about virtual events before the pandemic struck, but this format has fulfilled a unique and important need for organizations large and small since early 2020. But what will virtual events’ value be as more of the world attempts a return to “normal”?</p>
<p>To find out, we caught up with top executives and investors in the sector to learn about the big trends they’re seeing — as the sequel to a survey we did in March 2020.</p>
<p>We surveyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xiaoyin Qu, founder and CEO, Run The World</li>
<li>Rosie Roca, chief customer officer, Hopin</li>
<li>Hemant Mohapatra, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners India</li>
<li>Paul Murphy, former investor in Hopin with Northzone (currently co-founder of Katch)</li>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim wrapped up TechCrunch’s coverage of the summer cohort from Y Combinator’s Demo Day with an evaluation of how the group fared in comparison to their expectations.</p>
<p>They were surprised by the number of startups focusing on no-and low-code software, and pleased by the unanticipated quantity of new companies focusing on space.</p>
<p>“It seems only fair to note that some categories of startup activity simply met our expectations in terms of popularity,” noting delivery-focused startups including dark stores and kitchens.</p>
<p>Popping up less than expected? Crypto and insurtech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has delayed plans to roll out its child sexual abuse (CSAM) detection technology that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/">chaotically announced last month</a>, citing feedback from customers and policy groups.</p>
<p>That feedback, if you recall, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">been largely negative</a>. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said this week it had amassed more than 25,000 signatures from consumers. On top of that, close to 100 policy and rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/international-coalition-calls-on-apple-to-abandon-plan-to-build-surveillance-capabilities-into-iphones-ipads-and-other-products/">called</a> on Apple to abandon plans to roll out the technology.</p>
<p>In a statement on Friday morning, Apple told TechCrunch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s so-called NeuralHash technology is designed to identify known CSAM on a user’s device without having to possess the image or knowing the contents of the image. Because a user’s photos stored in iCloud are encrypted so that even Apple can’t access the data, NeuralHash instead scans for known CSAM on a user’s device, which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/?tpcc=ECTW2020">claims is more privacy-friendly</a> than the current blanket scanning that cloud providers use.</p>
<p>But security experts and privacy advocates have expressed concern that the system <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">could be abused</a> by highly resourced actors, like governments, to implicate innocent victims or to manipulate the system to detect other materials that authoritarian nation states find objectionable.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks of announcing the technology, researchers said they were able to create &#8220;hash collisions&#8221; using NeuralHash, effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">tricking the system</a> into thinking two entirely different images were the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>iOS 15 is expected out later in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><em>This report has been updated with more detail about NeuralHash and to clarify iCloud Photos are encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thecut.co/">TheCut</a>, a technology platform designed to handle back-end operations for barbers, raised $4.5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Nextgen Venture Partners led the round and was joined by Elevate Ventures, Singh Capital and Leadout Capital. The latest funding gives theCut $5.35 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2016, founder Obi Omile Jr. told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Omile and Kush Patel created the mobile app that provides information and reviews on barbers for potential customers while also managing appointments, mobile payments and pricing on the back end for barbers.</p>
<p>“Kush and I both had terrible experiences with haircuts, and decided to build an app to help find good barbers,” Omile said. “We found there were great barbers, but no way to discover them. You can do a Google search, but it doesn’t list the individual barber. With theCut, you can discover an individual barber and discover if they are a great fit for you and won’t screw up your hair.”</p>
<p>The app also enables barbers, perhaps for the first time, to have a list of clients and keep notes and photos of hair styles, as well as track visits and spending. By providing payments, barbers can also leverage digital trends to provide additional services and extras to bring in more revenue. On the customer side, there is a search function with barber profile, photos of their work, ratings and reviews, a list of service offerings and pricing.</p>
<p>Omile said there are 400,000 to 600,000 barbers in the U.S., and it is one of the fastest-growth markets. As a result, the new funding will be used to hire additional talent, marketing and to grow the business across the country.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotten to a place where we are hitting our stride and seeing business catapulting, so we are in hiring mode,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, the company generated more than $500 million in revenue for barbers since its launch and is adding over 100,000 users each month. In addition, the app averages 1.5 million appointment bookings each month.</p>
<p>Next up, Omile wants to build out some new features like a digital store and the ability to process more physical payments by rolling out a card reader for in-person payments. TheCut will also focus on enabling barbers to have more personal relationships with their customers.</p>
<p>“We are building software to empower people to be the best version of themselves, in this case barbers,” he added. “The relationship with customers is an opportunity for the barber to make specific recommendations on products and create a grooming experience.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Leadout founder and managing partner Ali Rosenthal joined the company&#8217;s board of directors. She said Omile and Patel are the kind of founders that venture capitalists look for — experts in their markets and data-driven technologists.</p>
<p>“They had done so much with so little by the time we met them,” Rosenthal added. “They are creating a passionate community and set of modern, tech-driven features that are tailored to the needs of their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> <em><a href="https://twitter.com/kylebrussell">Kyle Russell</a> is the founder of <a href="https://playbyte.io/">Playbyte</a>, a startup building an app that lets people make games on their phones.</em></p>
<p>Last Friday, Dom Hofmann tweeted the launch of <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/" rel="">Loot</a>, one of his new projects looking at games and game creation through the lens of NFTs:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If “NFTs,” “gas” and “minting” sound unintelligible, the short version is that this project lets you spend some money to create <strong>a unique list of items</strong> that you could keep in the same wallet (an app like <a href="http://rainbow.me/" rel="">Rainbow</a>) where you’d keep cryptocurrencies or other digital collectibles, typically art (or, as skeptics gleefully note, JPEGs).</p>
<p>I repeat: <strong>a unique list of items. </strong>No artwork, stats to compare quality or even game rules that could inform such stats.</p>
<p>People spent money to get those unique lists. Thousands. And as happens in NFTs, a market quickly formed around these unique lists of items. The “floor,” or minimum price to buy into a Loot “bag,” <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1432852925697646596?s=21" rel="">shot to thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum</a>. Certain kinds of items in these lists sounded cool and were found to be rare upon analysis of the entire set, and so bags containing them rose in value to extreme heights:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And people began to fill in those missing elements like art — not fundamentally changing the underlying lists, but creating new works that explicitly reference the items in particular lists:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And like the lists themselves, people began taking an algorithmic approach to generating that art:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>By August 31st, there was a legible community of people…</p>
<ul>
<li>investing in bags containing certain kinds of items;</li>
<li>creating tools for visualizing Loot items and monitoring price fluctuations in this niche market;</li>
<li>working on new derivative projects, like creating Realms for a theoretical adventurer with the gear in a Loot bag to explore:</li>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In less than a week, a community has gone from lists of text to infinitely many illustrations of those items to worlds for those items to reside in and characters to wield them. All from taking simple primitives and generating context around them that gives them value.</p>
<p>It’s pretty magical stuff. But even if there’s some speculative angle to the creation happening, how many people get to participate if these bags cost tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum? On the one hand: If you just think the game of making up a game is fun, because all of these bags and items live on the Ethereum network, then you can still make things that incorporate them at no cost (short of the painful fees currently associated with using Ethereum).</p>
<p>And if it really matters to you to have those unique objects in a wallet of your own so you can really participate, people are thinking of interesting paths there, as well:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>If that’s all too jargon-y, I’ll again summarize: There are feasible paths to making it free to “have” these items for the purpose of playing with the growing set of inter-compatible apps or games that might incorporate Loot — you just won’t have a Legit Bag with rare items that could sell for lots of money.</p>
<p>Oh, and what if you like some of the items in a Loot bag, but wish your adventurer could mix-and-match with other items from the broader set that just dropped?</p>

<p>Less than a week and already getting disrupted by unbundling!</p>
<h2>I’m sorry, why is this interesting?</h2>
<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe started with Marvel Comics taking out a billion-dollar loan to finance the first four movies based on its iconic superhero characters. The seeds of awareness of these characters had been planted in the minds of the masses through decades of appearances in comics and TV leading up to their first appearances in blockbuster films. Decades of perhaps hundreds of writers and artists were getting paid to create fantastical stories for those characters that people would want to read and that would get them hooked to come back for the next issue. People came to closely associate themselves with characters with kind of funny origins (bit by a radioactive spider!).</p>
<p>This all happened in a top-down, corporate, mass-production context. A few creatives at Marvel did high-leverage work on a freelance or in-house basis, printers made a ton of copies and a supply chain got those issues to comics shops and dime stores across the country. Like dominoes, Stan Lee thinks of some new superhero (pitch: this guy’s not a hippy, he’s a weapons manufacturer industrialist!) to five decades later, Avengers: Endgame and Black Panther warp the definition of blockbuster forever.</p>
<p>But what if someone wanted to create an MCU competitor as a community, instead of going head-to-head with Disney?</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the last week of Loot…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2197922 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_fa758d5e-644d-4c12-9d5a-9bcc41ed61ad_460x184.gif" alt="" width="460" height="184" /></p>
<p>You’d release a contract to generate sets of superhero names and associated powers. People would mint those heroes and they would begin to trade on the open market. People would build tools that determine which powers are more rare, especially around ones that sound cool (“flight” is a gimme).</p>
<p>They’d imagine their hero, illustrate them themselves and commission artists who could make them look cool. Eventually more technical folks in the community would do the heavy lifting to piece together tools that could generate art for characters in a common style, or be customizable by some key parameters.</p>
<p>Eventually, people would commission crossover art, and then you’re only a step away from shared storylines (increase the value of multiple characters with a single commissioned piece!).</p>
<p>DAOs, or decentralized groups who come together to create new projects in the crypto space or even &#8220;just” invest together, might buy up more popular characters and commission more elaborate visual stories with the aim of boosting the value of that underlying item containing a hero name + powers and any popular artworks that they inspired.</p>
<p>And assuming the project’s originators went with the direction of the Loot zeitgeist, all of this would be IP that could be re-used and remixed by anyone. That might sound crazy — isn’t the point to own it, and the point of owning it is to control how it’s used?</p>
<p>That’s the Disney status quo. In a world of projects like Loot, you want to reinforce the value of the NFT you own — and that value reflects that NFT’s renown and reputation. Echoing the phrase “all press is good press”: Any remix is a good remix. To be referenced is to still be culturally relevant. So if you own an NFT describing Arachnid Person, you want to contribute to an environment where as many people want to include Arachnid Person in their works as possible so that Arachnid Man No. 1 becomes something worth owning.</p>
<p>I’m really just expanding on Dylan Field:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Feels like two paths are emerging in NFT space.</p>
<p>(1) Build a universe but hold onto IP. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@larvalabs</a> deal with UTA (<a href="https://t.co/OxOq106hiK">https://t.co/OxOq106hiK</a>)</p>
<p>(2) Form a community to build a universe. Give all the IP away. See what happens. Ex: <a href="https://twitter.com/lootproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lootproject</a> </p>
<p>Personally like approach #2 better!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And John Palmer rightly emphasizes something special: The lack of anybody who can say “no,” as people try to figure out how to make Loot cool:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Clootrack is a real-time customer experience analytics platform that helps brands understand why customers stay or churn]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getting inside the mind of customers is a challenge as behaviors and demands shift, but <a href="https://clootrack.com">Clootrack</a> believes it has cracked the code in helping brands figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>It announced $4 million in Series A funding, led by Inventus Capital India, and included existing investors Unicorn India Ventures, IAN Fund and Salamander Excubator Angel Fund, as well as individual investment from Jiffy.ai CEO Babu Sivadasan. In total, the company raised $4.6 million, co-founder Shameel Abdulla told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Clootrack is a real-time customer experience analytics platform that helps brands understand why customers stay or churn. Shameel Abdulla and Subbakrishna Rao, who both come from IT backgrounds, founded the company in 2017 after meeting years prior at Jiffstore, Abdulla’s second company that was acquired in 2015.</p>

<p>Business-to-consumer and consumer brands often use customer satisfaction metrics like Net Promoter Score to understand the customer experience, but Abdulla said current methods don’t provide the “why” of those experiences and are slow, expensive and error-prone.</p>
<p>“The number of channels has increased, which means customers are talking to you, expressing their feedback and what they think in multiple places,” he added. “Word of mouth has gone digital, and you basically have to master the art of selling online.”</p>
<p>Clootrack turns the customer experience data from all of those first-party and third-party touchpoints — website feedback, chat bots, etc. — into granular, qualitative insights that give brands a look at drivers of the experience in hours rather than months so that they can stay on top of fast-moving trends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abdulla points to data that show <a href="https://d1eipm3vz40hy0.cloudfront.net/pdf/cxtrends/cx-trends-2020-full-report.pdf">a customer’s biggest driver of brand switch</a> is the experience they receive. And, that <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers">if brands can reduce churns by 5%</a>, they could be looking at an increase in profits of between 25% and 95%.</p>
<p>Most of the new funding will go to product development so that all data aggregations are gathered from all possible touchpoints. His ultimate goal is to be “the single platform for B2C firms.”</p>
<p>The company is currently working with over 150 customers in the areas of retail, direct-to-consumer, banking, automotive, travel and mobile app-based services. It is growing nine times year over year in revenue. It is mainly operating in India, but Clootrack is also onboarding companies in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Parag Dhol, managing director of Inventus, said he has known Abdulla for over five years. He had looked at one of Abdulla’s companies for investment, but had decided against it due to his firm being a Series A investor.</p>
<p>Dhol said market research needs an overhaul in India, where this type of technology is lagging behind the U.S.</p>
<p>“Clootrack has a very complementary team with Shameel being a complete CEO in terms of being a sales guy and serial entrepreneur who has learned his lessons, and Subbu, who is good at technology,” he added. “As CMOs realize the value in their unstructured data inside of their own database of the customer reviews and move to real-time feedback, these guys could make a serious dent in the space.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Feeding babies can take many different forms, and is also an area where parents can feel less supported as they navigate this new milestone in their lives.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://simplifed.us/">SimpliFed</a>, an Ithaca, New York-based company providing virtual lactation and a baby feeding support platform. The startup announced Friday that it raised $500,000 in pre-seed funding led by Third Culture Capital.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197924" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197924" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2197924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Andrea-Ippolito-Pic.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197924" class="wp-caption-text">Andrea Ippolito, founder and CEO of SimpliFed. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimpliFed</p></div></p>
<p>CEO Andrea Ippolito, a biomedical engineer and mother of two young children, had the idea for SimpliFed three years ago. She struggled with breastfeeding after having her first child and, realizing that she was not alone in this area, set out to figure out a way to get anyone access to information and support for infant feeding.</p>
<p>“Post discharge is when the rubber meets the road for us,” she told TechCrunch. “This is a huge pain point for Medicaid, and it is not just about increasing access, but providing ongoing support for feeding and the quagmire that is health insurance. We want to help moms reach their infant feeding goals, no matter how they choose to feed, and to figure out what feeding looks like for them.”</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/faq/index.htm#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,How%20long%20should%20a%20mother%20breastfeed%3F,for%201%20year%20or%20longer.">mothers nurse for up to six months</a>. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/facts.html#:~:text=Sixty%20percent%20of%20mothers%20do,long%20as%20they%20intend%20to.&amp;text=How%20long%20a%20mother%20breastfeeds,Issues%20with%20lactation%20and%20latching.&amp;text=Concerns%20about%20infant%20nutrition%20and%20weight.">60% of mothers don’t breastfeed for as long as they intend</a> due to reasons like difficulty lactating or the baby latching, sickness or an unsupportive work environment.</p>
<p>SimpliFed’s platform is a judgement-free zone providing evidence-based information on nutritional health for babies. It isn’t meant to replace typical care that mother and baby will receive before and after delivery, but to provide support when issues arise, Ippolito said. Parents can book a free, initial 15-minute virtual consultation with a lactation expert and then subsequent 60-minute sessions for $100 each. There is also a future membership option for those seeking continuing care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funds will be used to hire additional employees to further develop the telelactation platform and grow the company’s footprint, Ippolito said. The platform is gearing up to go through a clinical study to co-design the program with 1,000 mothers. She also wants to build out relationships with payers and providers toward a longer-term goal of becoming in-network and paid through reimbursement from health plans.</p>
<p>Julien Pham, managing partner at Third Culture Capital, said he met Ippolito at MIT Hacking Medicine a decade ago. A physician by training, he saw first-hand how big of an opportunity it is to demystify providing the best nutrition for babies.</p>
<p>“The U.S. culture has evolved over the years, and millennials are the next-generation moms who have a different ask, and SimpliFed is here at the right time,” Pham said. “Andrea is just a dynamo. We love her energy and how she is at the front line of this as a mother herself — she is most qualified to do this, and we support her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) company Zip this week <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/38746/zip-sets-sights-on-africa-with-acquisition-of-payflex">acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex</a> for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a piece of news that once again highlights the hype around BNPL services and the quest for global dominance among the leading players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covered BNPL services from the likes of Afterpay, Klarna and Affirm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal and Visa have joined in the action, too, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">massively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funneling cash to their respective BNPL initiatives (for one, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">Square acquired Afterpay</a>)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Square is shelling out $29B to snag BNPL player Afterpay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/embed/#?secret=JTBugxRpwq" data-secret="JTBugxRpwq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. are key markets for BNPL services. The U.S. market is so big that the number of BNPL service users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hit 45 million by year&#8217;s end, representing an 81% growth from last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite its Western focus, BNPL is exploding in other markets driven by a collective effort from local and global players. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/dubai-based-buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-raises-50m-at-300m-valuation/">tabby</a> and Tamara have raised millions in debt and equity financing to provide BNPL services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Checkout <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37914/checkoutcom-leads-110-million-debt-and-equity-round-in-saudi-bnpl-startup-tamara">is a significant shareholder in Tamara</a>; Afterpay <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australias-afterpay-takes-stake-in-gulf-buy-now-pay-later-firm-postpay-2021-06-28">is one in PostPay</a>, while Zip <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210523005030/en/Zip-Expands-into-Europe-and-the-Middle-East-with-the-Acquisitions-of-European-BNPL-Provider-Twisto-and-UAE-based-Spotii">acquired Spotii for $26 million</a> after initially investing in the company in December 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotii isn&#8217;t the only acquisition Zip has made this past year. The Australian company also bought U.S.-based QuadPay and Twisto, a BNPL service in the Czech Republic, to expand footprints in both regions.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payflex is the latest addition to that list. The company, founded in 2017, claims to be the first and largest BNPL player in South Africa with more than 1,000 merchants and 135,000 customers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before fully acquiring Payflex, Zip had a 25% stake when it invested in the South African BNPL service six months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip&#8217;s entry to Africa is important for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the continent is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> untapped market that has enormous growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit appetite on the continent is very much in its infancy compared to Western markets, but it is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These days, people take loans to finance their needs at ridiculous interest rates while lending companies report low NPL ratios. Think of what happens when these consumers get a taste of low or no-interest alternative financing options that BNPL players like Zip provide: adoption rates will be off the charts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, there&#8217;s a lack of infrastructure and BNPL innovation that only new entrants like Zip can execute because it has a large monetary chest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the absence of credit cards and data on the continent, Zip can provide a competitive advantage with its technology, gather alternative data and build creditworthiness for customers in South Africa and other markets it plans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand &#8220;with sizable underbanked, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> savvy populations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of those markets are Egypt and Nigeria. If Zip expands to these regions, it will face competition from local players like Carbon, Shahry, M-Kopa, CredPal and CDCare, which are already pulling their weight. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African e-commerce giant Jumia is also rumored to be revamping its BNPL service; it started one years ago but was discontinued after gaining little traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>That said, Africa doesn&#8217;t have a concrete market leader yet since most of these products are yet to reach mass scale. On the other hand, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip has been quite aggressive with its expansion into other markets &#8212; evident in some of its numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently serves 51,000 merchants and 7.3 million customers across 12 markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This fiscal year, June 2021, a period when most of its acquisitions have occurred, Zip hit $5.8 billion in total transaction volume, up 176% year-over-year (YoY).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip numbers are impressive, but if there&#8217;s anything we&#8217;ve learnt from the BNPL business it&#8217;s that it isn&#8217;t a winner-takes-all market. If Zip makes significant headway and cracks the market, expect more global BNPL players to bring the heat. Also, local players will be encouraged to step up their game because global players have surplus cash to burn if they move into Africa, which is a win-win for the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a venture capitalist. Nearly everyone in the industry is raking in money, either through long-awaited exits or because more capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">flooding into the industry</a> has meant more money in management fees  &#8212; and sometimes both.</p>
<p>Still, a growing number of early-stage investors is becoming wary about the pace of dealmaking. It&#8217;s not just that it&#8217;s a lot harder to write checks at what feels like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">reasonable clip</a> at the moment, or that most VCs feel they can <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1414953528162988032?lang=en">no longer afford to be price sensitive</a>. Many of the founders with whom they work are being handed follow-on checks before figuring out how best to deploy their last round of funding.</p>
<p>Consider that from 2016 through 2019, an average of 35 deals a month featured rounds of $100 million or more,<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-Q2-2021.pdf"> according to the data company CB Insights</a>. This year, that number is closer to 130 of these so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/technology/venture-capital-mega-round.html">mega-rounds</a> per month. The froth is hardly contained to maturing companies. According to CB Insights&#8217;s data, the median U.S. Series A valuation hit $42 million in the second quarter, driven in part crossover investors like Tiger Global, which closed 1.26 deals <em>per business day</em> in Q2. (Andreessen Horowitz wasn&#8217;t far behind.)</p>
<p>It makes for some bewildering times, including for longtime investor Jeff Clavier, the founder the early-stage venture firm Uncork Capital. Like many of his peers, Clavier is benefiting from the booming market. Among Uncork&#8217;s portfolio companies, for example is <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, a company that helps software developers avoid missteps. The seven-year-old company announced $200 million in Series D funding last month at a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2021/08/10/launchdarkly-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/?sh=30e3f63d4381">$3 billion valuation</a>. That&#8217;s triple the valuation it was assigned early last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awesome company, so I&#8217;m very excited for them,&#8221; says Clavier.</p>
<p>At the same time, he adds, &#8220;You have to put this money to work in a very smart way.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so easy in this market, where founders are inundated with interest and, in some cases, are talking term sheets after the first Zoom with an investor. (&#8220;The most absurd thing we’ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder,&#8221; says TX Zhou, the cofounder of L.A.-based seed-stage firm Fika Ventures, which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/fika-ventures-nearly-triples-its-assets-under-management-its-definitely-a-crazy-time/">just tripled</a> the amount of assets it&#8217;s managing.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More money can mean a much longer lifeline for a company. But as many investors have learned the hard way, it can also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/business/dealbook/softbank-vision-fund-wag.html">serve as a distraction</a>, as well as hide fundamental issues with a business until it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/business/softbank-wag.html">too late to address them</a>.</p>
<p>Taking on more money also oftentimes goes hand-in-hand with a bigger valuation, and lofty valuations comes with their own positives and negatives. On the plus side, of course, big numbers can attract more attention to a company from the press, from customers, and from potential new hires.  At the same time, &#8220;The more money you raise, the higher the valuation it is, it catches up with you on the next round, because you&#8217;ve got to clear that watermark,&#8221; says Renata Quintini of the venture firm Renegade Partners, which focuses largely on Series B-stage companies.</p>
<p>Again, in today&#8217;s market, trying to slow down isn&#8217;t always possible. Quintini says that some founders her firm has talked with have said that they&#8217;re not going to raise any more, explaining that they cannot go faster or deploy more than their business model is already supporting For others, she continues, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to look at what&#8217;s happening around you, and sometimes if your competitors are raising and they&#8217;re going to have a bigger war chest and [they&#8217;re] pushing the market forward and maybe they can out-hire you or they can outspend you in certain areas where they can generate more traction than you,&#8221; that next check, often at the higher valuation, begins to look like the only path to survival.</p>
<p>Many VCs have argued that today&#8217;s valuations make sense because companies are creating new markets, growing faster than before, and have more opportunities to expand globally, and certainly, in some cases, that it is true. Indeed, companies that were previously believed to be richly priced by their private investors, like Airbnb and Doordash, have seen their valuations soar as publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s also true that for many more companies, &#8220;valuation is completely disconnected from the [companies&#8217;] multiples,&#8221; says Clavier, echoing what other VCs acknowledge privately.</p>
<p>That might seem to be the kind of problem that investors love to face. But as been the case for years now, that depends on how long this go-go market lasts.</p>
<p>Clavier says that one of his own companies that &#8220;did a great Series A and did a great Series B ahead of its time is now being preempted for a Series C, and the valuation is just completely disconnected from their actual reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s happy for the outfit &#8220;because I have no doubt they will catch up. But this is the point: they will have to catch up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Firefly launched its first rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, and on board it carried a number of payloads with an intended destination of low Earth orbit. The rocket took off as planned, and seemed to be doing fairly well during the initial portion of the launch, before experiencing &#8220;an anomaly&#8221; that clearly resulted in an explosion and the total loss of the vehicle prior to reaching space.</p>
<p>The rocket that flew today is Firefly&#8217;s Alpha launch vehicle, its first, and this was its first launch attempt ever of the spacecraft. Actually getting off the pad on the first try is in itself an accomplishment, and the loss of the vehicle looks to have taken place some time after what&#8217;s known as &#8216;max q,&#8217; or the time when the spacecraft is experiencing the most aerodynamic stress prior to leaving Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Firefly issued a statement via Twitter shortly after the explosion was broadcast on a live stream hosted by Everyday Astronaut, which included official audio and video provided by the company. It added that the ground staff had cleared the pad and surrounding areas in order to minimize risk and in adherence with safety protocols.</p>
<p>The company expects to provide more details about what happened with the Alpha rocket and why the craft was lost later, and we&#8217;ll update accordingly.</p>
<p>A private commercial launch firm based in Austin, Firefly was originally founded in 2014 and survived a bankruptcy to emerge as Firefly Aerospace in 2017. The company&#8217;s Alpha rocket is a fully expendable small launch vehicle that can carry around 2,200 lbs to low-Earth orbit, and it&#8217;s also developing a Beta rocket that should be able to carry around 17,000 lbs of payload to LEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California DoorDash workers protested outside of the home of DoorDash CEO Tony Xu on Thursday, prompted by a recent California Superior Court Judge ruling calling 2020’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">Proposition 22 unconstitutional</a>. Prop 22, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">was passed last November in California</a>, would allow app-based companies like DoorDash, Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of about 50 DoorDash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups We Drive Progress and Gig Workers Rising traveled caravan style to the front of Xu’s house in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. They demanded that DoorDash provide transparency for tips and 120% of minimum wage or around $17 per hour,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment, as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing. </span></p>
<p>“Dasher concerns and feedback are always important to us, and we will continue to hear their voices and engage our community directly,&#8221; a DoorDash spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;However, we know that today’s participants do not speak for the 91% of California Dashers who want to remain independent contractors or the millions of California voters who overwhelmingly supported Proposition 22. The reality is, the passage of Prop 22 has addressed in law many of the concerns raised today through its historic benefits and protections: workers earn 120% of their local minimum wage per active hour in addition to 100% of their tips, receive free PPE and enjoy access to healthcare funds.”</p>
<p>DoorDash drivers say getting paid for the time they&#8217;re &#8220;active,&#8221; meaning <span style="font-weight: 400;">actively driving to either pick up food and drop it off, rather than when they’re online and waiting for gigs to come through, leads to inadequate pay. They also say much of their living wage comes from tips, which should be an added bonus, but ends up helping make ends meet based on DoorDash&#8217;s pay structure. DoorDash says paying drivers only for engaged time allows them to have the flexibility to use multiple apps at one time, either while they&#8217;re actively working or while they&#8217;re driving around running personal errands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prop 22 is also meant to guarantee a reimbursement of 30 cents per engaged mile, which drivers say &#8220;would be great if it were true.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rondu Gantt, a gig worker who’s been working for DoorDash for two and a half years and also drives for Uber and Lyft to get by, says his base pay from DoorDash is often as low as $3 per hour, and that around 40% to 60% of his money comes from tips. Although this model sounds similar to the restaurant industry in the United States, which can be quite lucrative for servers and bartenders, for a delivery driver, it’s an unsustainable way to make a living because tipping culture isn’t nearly as strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DoorDash pays so low because they want to make it affordable for the customer, but I would say for the driver it becomes unaffordable,” Gantt told TechCrunch, citing the costs of owning, maintaining, parking and fueling a vehicle as potentially crippling. “Last week, I drove for 30 hours and I made $405. That’s $13.50 per hour, which is below minimum wage.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantt said drivers also have had to deal with pressure to drive in unsafe conditions, and we can look to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/storm-ida-food-delivery-drivers-wade-through-waist-high-floods-2021-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">images of delivery drivers in New York City</a> during Hurricane Ida as an example of some conditions drivers feel compelled to accept. Over the past two years, DoorDash drivers have also been deemed essential workers, interacting with and providing services for many people during a pandemic at the risk of their health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig Workers Rising says DoorDash workers “have received little to no safety support” with some workers reporting “being reimbursed as little as 80 cents per day for cleaning/sanitizing equipment and PPE that they use to keep themselves and customers safe.” A DoorDash spokesperson said workers have been entitled to free PPE since the start of the pandemic, which they can learn more about <a href="https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Dasher-Supplies-for-Covid-19?language=en_US">online</a> and order weekly supplies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now gig work isn&#8217;t flexible,” a spokesperson for Gig Workers Rising told TechCrunch.  “Workers are at the mercy of when there&#8217;s demand. If they were employees the work would change as they&#8217;d work in the knowledge that they&#8217;ve healthcare and can take a sick day off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Prop 22 was ruled unconstitutional, the spokesperson said by rights it shouldn’t be in operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gig corporations violate that law everyday by choosing not to comply with it,” he said. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">DoorDash holds firm that Prop 22 is still the law, and they expect the ruling to be appealed and Prop 22 to be upheld.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Gantt&#8217;s part, he doesn’t necessarily want to be an employee, he just wants to make sure that he’s being paid what he deserves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Which is not minimum wage,” he said. “Minimum wage would be unacceptable as well. The cost of doing this, the danger, makes minimum wage unacceptable pay. And realistically, they’re only sometimes paying you minimum wage before taxes. After taxes you’re definitely making less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch was given access to DoorDash workers’ dashboards that break down their pay. For the week of July 12 to July 19, one dasher was paid a total of $574.21 for 53 deliveries, $274 of which came from customer tip. His &#8220;active time&#8221; was 14 hours and 21 minutes, and his &#8220;dash time,&#8221; or when he was logged onto the app waiting for gigs to come through and doing deliveries, was about 30 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dasher’s &#8220;guaranteed earnings&#8221; from DoorDash for the week was $300.21, a number that&#8217;s calculated to ensure drivers go home with 120% of minimum wage for active time. His base pay ended up at about $257.62, but DoorDash added an additional $42.59 to adjust to guaranteed earnings. If we divide the amount DoorDash paid by the number of hours of “active time,” the worker was paid about $21 per hour. If we divide it by the “dash time,” it looks more like $10 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this is before tax. Independent contractors are usually advised to put aside around 30% of their paycheck because they have to pay self-employment tax, which is 15.3% of taxable income, federal income tax, which varies depending on tax bracket, and potentially state income tax. After taxes, this dasher’s total pay for 30 hours of work, including his $274 worth of tip, would be around $402, which comes out to $13.40 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips were of concern at the protest on Thursday as drivers called for transparency. Gantt says dashers can see a cumulative amount of tip earnings per week, as well as how much tip they’re receiving from each order, but they don’t trust the amount they’re receiving is actually the amount customers are tipping them. DoorDash told TechCrunch drivers definitely do receive 100% of their tips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantt and other drivers aren’t just being paranoid. Last November,</span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/25/bay-areas-doordash-to-pay-2-5-million-after-being-accused-of-stealing-drivers-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DoorDash agreed to pay $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to settle a lawsuit alleging the company stole drivers’ tips and allowed customers to think their tip money was actually going to the drivers. The suit, filed by Washington, D.C. attorney general Karl Racine, alleged DoorDash reduced drivers’ pay for each job by the amount of any tip. DoorDash denies the allegations and that they pertain to its former pay model which hasn&#8217;t been in use since September 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the second quarter, DoorDash saw a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/airbnb-doordash-report-earnings-as-covid-threatens-to-slow-the-irl-economy-again/">$113 million profit adjusted for EBITDA</a>, but was overall unprofitable with a net loss of $102 million. One of the rallying cries of the protest was for Xu to “share the wealth.” In 2020, the CEO was </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/subscriber-only/2021/06/04/highest-paid-ceos.html">reportedly</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the highest paid CEO<strong> i</strong>n the Bay Area, making a total income of $413.67 million, which includes salary and stock options. DoorDash says Xu has not actually been paid any of the compensation in the report as of today, compensation which Xu only gets paid if DoorDash significantly outperforms the market and achieves a 5x return over the next seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all work for money and how that money gets distributed when they go through their earnings is telling you who matters and who doesn’t matter,&#8221; said Gantt. &#8220;It’s a clear sign of who’s important, who has value. If they don’t pay you, they don’t value you.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The BMW Group <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341522EN/bmw-group-accelerates-co2-reduction-and-focuses-consistently-on-a-circular-economy-with-the-neue-klasse">announced Thursday</a> its intentions to commit to a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p>Announced in March, the BMW &#8220;New Class&#8221; is a reboot of a line of sedans and coupes the German automaker produced from 1962-1977, a line that established BMW&#8217;s identity as a sports car manufacturer. The new line will feature &#8220;a completely redefined IT and software architecture, a new generation of high-performance electric drivetrains and batteries and a radically new approach to sustainability across the entire vehicle life cycle,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/03/17/neue-klasse-bmw-electric-architecture/">according to the company</a>.</p>
<p>“With the Neue Klasse we are significantly sharpening our commitment and also committing ourselves to a clear course for achieving the 1.5 degree target,&#8221; said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, in a statement. “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the substantial reduction of CO2 emissions; these are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative and will deliver an effective and measurable contribution.”</p>
<p>BMW says the utilization phase of its vehicles accounts for 70% of the group&#8217;s total CO2 footprint, which makes sense given the fact that most of BMW&#8217;s car sales are still ICE vehicles. In the first half of 2021, about 11.44% of BMW&#8217;s total sales volume were either electric or plug-in hybrid, according to its <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf">2021 half-year earnings report</a>. The company has expressed a goal of selling 1 million plug-in units, including hybrids, by the end of 2021. As of Q2, it&#8217;s already at around 850,000, but in order to reach its goal of halving emissions during the utilization phase, BMW will need to seriously up its sales of low or zero-emissions vehicles. BMW already has its i3 compact EV out and plans to launch two long-range models, the i4 sedan and iX SUV, later this year, with plans for more in 2022. But unlike GM or Volvo, the automaker has not yet announced plans to kill its ICE vehicles, nor has it begun to sell a full line of vehicles designed from the ground up to run on batteries.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just a couple of months after BMW, along with other German automakers Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, acknowledged its involvement in colluding on an emissions cartel since the 1990s. The automakers collectively hid technology that would have been able to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emissions standards. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/">The EU fined BMW $442 million</a>, a slap on the wrist given <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/03/bmw-q2-earnings-profit-guidance/">BMW&#8217;s second-quarter profits of close to $6 billion</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the EU&#8217;s &#8220;Fit for 55&#8221; energy and climate package, which was released last month, upgraded the overall carbon emissions reductions goal from <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/environmentemissions/european-auto-industry-braces-tougher-co2-emissions-targets-2030">40% to 55% by 2030</a>, which means automakers need to pick up the pace of electrification, and BMW knows that. Other proposals reportedly under discussion in the European Commission involve a 60% emissions reduction by 2030, followed by 100% cut by 2035, which would make it near impossible to sell ICE vehicles by that time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BMW says its Neue Klasse will further the momentum to get EVs to market. The automaker aims to have 10 million all-electric cars on the road over the next decade, with at least half of all BMW Group sales being all-electric and the Mini brand offering exclusively all-electric from 2030. As part of its circular economy focus, BMW also intends to incorporate an increase of use of secondary materials and promote a better framework for establishing a market for secondary materials with the Neue Klasse. The company says it aims to raise the percentage of secondary materials it uses from its current rate of 30% to 50%, but didn&#8217;t specify by when.</p>
<p>BMW says its use of secondary nickel in the iX battery, for example, is already 50%, with the battery housing containing up to 30% secondary aluminum, and the goal is to improve those numbers. BMW is also piloting a project with BASF and the ALBA Group to increase the recycling of plastics used in cars.</p>
<p>As part of what BMW is calling a comprehensive recycling system, &#8220;the ALBA Group analyses end-of-life BMW Group vehicles to establish whether a car-to-car reuse of the plastic is possible,&#8221; according to a statement by the company. &#8220;In a second step, BASF assesses whether chemical recycling of the pre-sorted waste can be used in order to obtain pyrolysis oil. This can then be used as a basis for new products made of plastic. In the future, a new door trim or other components could be manufactured from a used instrument panel, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure an easier recycling process, BMW is also incorporating early-stage design of vehicles. Materials must be put together in a way that&#8217;s easy to disassemble at the end of life and then reuse. The automaker says it will increasingly build the interior of a car with monomaterials that can be transferred back into usable material.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, the onboard wiring systems must be easy to remove, in order to avoid mixing steel with copper from the cable harnesses in the vehicles,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;If this mixing does take place, the secondary steel loses its essential material properties and therefore no longer meets the high safety requirements of the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A circular economy also involves using higher-quality vehicles, which will reduce the overall number of materials used because those parts can be recycled or fixed more easily.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The tough calculus of emissions and the future of EVs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/embed/#?secret=CEVxYWbQUX" data-secret="CEVxYWbQUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With this announcement, BMW promises transparency when it comes to the life cycle of its vehicles. The company does indeed publish life cycle assessments (LCAs), as does almost every other major car manufacturer, but there&#8217;s no standard in the industry yet, which means it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to compare different vehicles. Looking at the overall life cycle of a vehicle will be increasingly important if we actually want to cut emissions goals. The emissions that come from the supply chains and manufacturing processes to obtain all the materials needed to even build batteries and vehicles is a body of research that&#8217;s only just coming to light, and what that light reveals is the possibility that these moves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">could even increase emissions in the aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Embodied emissions can be devilishly difficult to accurately quantify, and nowhere are there more complexities and uncertainties than with EVs,&#8221; writes Mark Mills, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">recent TechCrunch article</a> about what it takes to calculate the real carbon cost of EVs. &#8220;While an EV self-evidently emits nothing while driving, about 80% of its total lifetime emissions arise from the combination of the embodied energy in fabricating the battery and then in &#8216;fabricating&#8217; electricity to power the vehicle. The remaining comes from manufacturing the non-fuel parts of the car. That ratio is inverted for a conventional car where about 80% of lifecycle emissions come directly from fuel burned while driving, and the rest comes from the embodied energy to make the car and fabricate gasoline.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups devoted to reproductive and women’s health are on the rise. However, most of them deal with women’s fertility: birth control, ovulation and the inability to conceive. The broader field of women’s health remains neglected.</p>
<p>Historically, most of our understanding of ailments comes from the perspective of men and is overwhelmingly based on studies using male patients. Until the early 1990s, women of childbearing age were kept out of drug trial studies, and the resulting bias has been an ongoing issue in healthcare. Other issues include underrepresentation of women in health studies, trivialization of women&#8217;s physical complaints (which is relevant to the misdiagnosis of endometriosis, among other conditions), and gender bias in the funding of research, especially in research grants.</p>
<p>For example, several studies have shown that when we look at National Institutes of Health funding, a disproportionate share of its resources goes to diseases that primarily affect men &#8212; at the expense of those that primarily affect women. In 2019, studies of NIH funding based on disease burden (as estimated by the number of years lost due to an illness) showed that male-favored diseases were funded at twice the rate of female-favored diseases.</p>
<p>Let’s take endometriosis as an example. Endometriosis is a disease where endometrial-like tissue (‘‘lesions’’) can be found outside the uterus. Endometriosis is a condition that only occurs in individuals with uteruses and has been less funded and less studied than many other conditions. It can cause chronic pain, fatigue, painful intercourse and infertility. Although the disease may affect one out of 10 women, diagnosis is still very slow, and the disease is confirmed only by surgery.</p>
<p>There is no non-invasive test available. In many cases, a woman is diagnosed only due to her infertility, and the diagnosis can take up to 10 years. Even after diagnosis, the understanding of disease biology and progression is poor, as well as the understanding of the relationships to other lesion diseases, such as adenomyosis. Current treatments include surgical removal of lesions and drugs that suppress ovarian hormone (mainly estrogen) production.</p>
<p>However, there are changes in the works. The NIH created the women’s health research category in 1994 for annual budgeting purposes and, in 2019, it was updated to include research that is relevant to women only. In acknowledging the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/jwh.2020.8682">widespread male bias</a> in both human and animal studies, the NIH mandated in 2016 that grant applicants would be required to recruit male and female participants in their <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161318.htm">protocols</a>. These changes are slow, and if we look at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232627/">endometriosis</a>, it received just $7 million in NIH funding in the fiscal year 2018, putting it near the very bottom of NIH’s 285 disease/research areas.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that critical changes are coming from other sources, and not so much from the funding agencies or the pharmaceutical industry. The push is coming from patients and physicians themselves that meet the diseases regularly. We see pharmaceutical companies (such as <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-centre-womens-health-focuses-osteoporosis-awareness-may">Eli Lilly</a> and AbbVie) in the women&#8217;s healthcare space following the lead of their patients and slowly expanding their R&amp;D base and doubling efforts to expand beyond reproductive health into other key women&#8217;s health areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New technological innovations targeting endometriosis are being funded via <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vc-finally-invests-in-endometriosis-a-condition-that-impacts-1-in-10-women/">private sources</a>. In 2020, women’s health finally emerged as one of the most promising areas of investment. These <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/femtech-future/">include</a> (not an exhaustive list by any means) diagnostics companies such as NextGen Jane, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/a-startup-trying-to-detect-endometriosis-through-smart-tampons-just-landed-9-million-in-series-a-funding/">raised</a> a $9 million Series A in April 2021 for its “smart tampon,” and DotLab, a non-invasive endometriosis testing startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/with-a-fresh-10-million-in-the-bank-dotlab-founder-hopes-to-bring-novel-endometriosis-test-to-market/">raised</a> $10 million from investors last July. Other notable advances include the research-study app <a href="http://citizenendo.org/phendo/">Phendo</a> that tracks endometriosis, and <a href="https://gynica.com/">Gynica</a>, a company focused on cannabis-based treatments for gynecological issues.</p>
<p>The complexity of endometriosis is such that any single biotech startup may find it challenging to go it alone. One approach to tackle this is through collaborations. Two companies, Polaris Quantum Biotech and Auransa, have teamed up to tackle the endometriosis challenge and other women’s specific diseases.</p>
<p>Using data, algorithms and quantum computing, this collaboration between two female-led AI companies integrates the understanding of disease biology with chemistry. Moreover, they are not stopping at in silico; rather, this collaboration aims to bring therapeutics to patients.</p>
<p>New partnerships can majorly impact how fast a field like women’s health can advance. Without such concerted efforts, women-centric diseases such as endometriosis, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, to name a few, may remain neglected and result in much-needed therapeutics not moving into clinics promptly.</p>
<p>Using state-of-the-art technologies on complex women’s diseases will allow the field to advance much faster and can put drug candidates into clinics in a few short years, especially with the help of patient advocacy groups, research organizations, physicians and out-of-the-box funding approaches such as crowdfunding from the patients themselves.</p>
<p>We believe that going after the women’s health market is a win-win for the patients as well as from the business perspective, as the global market for endometriosis drugs alone is expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/07/2205739/0/en/Global-Endometriosis-Drugs-Market-to-Reach-2-2-Billion-by-2027.html">$2.2 billion</a> in the next six years.</p>
