										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kredivo.com/">Kredivo</a> announced today it has secured another $100 million debt facility from Victory Park Capital (VPC). This doubles the Indonesian digital lending and credit platform’s total warehouse financing facility from VPC to $200 million. The <a href="https://www.victoryparkcapital.com/news/2020/11/24/kredivo-secures-100m-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-boost-indonesian-expansion/">first round </a>was closed in July 2020.</p>
<p>Kredivo is operated by Singapore-based fintech FinAccel. This is the largest loan facility it has raised so far, and is VPC’s biggeast debt commitment to a fintech company outside of the United States and Europe, as well as its only investment in Southeast Asia. Kredivo will use the debt facility to help achieve its goal of serving 10 million customers in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Other notable startups that have received debt financing from VPC include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/">factory 14</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/latin-america-roundup-softbank-bets-on-brazillian-unicorns-and-konfio-raises-250m-for-lending-plans/">Konfio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/ipo-on-horizon-subprime-lending-startup-elevate-adds-545m-in-credit-from-victory-park-capital/">Elevate</a>.</p>
<p>Kredivo has more than three million customers and offers two main types of lending products: zero interest 30-day ‘buy now, pay later’ financing for e-commerce and offline purchases, and three-, six- and 12-month installment loans with an interest rate of 2.6% a month, or a maximum annual rate of 53.36%. Kredivo chief executive officer Akshay Garg told TechCrunch that its ‘buy now, pay later’ services are typically used for small-value online purchases, while installment loans are used to finance bigger transactions, like laptops, home renovation or medical care.</p>
<p>While ‘buy now, pay later’ services like Klarna, Afterpay or Affirm offer convenience to customers in the United States or Europe, in emerging markets it also serves as a tool to build credit, especially in countries that have low credit card penetration, Garg said.</p>

<p>“Credit is one of the largest and most complex areas of the financial services ecosystem and the fact is that Indonesia is deeply underserved on that equation,” he said. Most banks only provide secured lending, like home or car loans, and unsecured lending is rare. Garg said there are only eight million credit card holders in Indonesia, which has a population of 270.6 million, and that number has not changed in 13 years.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for Indonesia&#8217;s very low credit card penetration rate is because banks are reluctant to give unsecured loans, especially to younger customers.</p>
<p>“What we’re solving is less a convenience problem and more an access problem. We’re putting unsecured credit, or the ability to buy on credit, in the hands of urban millennials for the first time, simply because banks are just not providing them access to credit cards,&#8221; said Garg.</p>
<p>He added that Kredivo’s effective risk-scoring model allows to charge low interest rates, and its non-performing loan ratio is in the low single-digits, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, which Garg described as a “trial by fire.”</p>
<p>Like credit cards from banks, Kredivo also reports customers’ loan histories to Indonesia’s credit bureaus, so they can build credit scores. “What we’re doing is a building Indonesia’s first real digital credit bureau from the ground up, and I think our risk metrics show that this is not just for the sake of some funky innovation, but something that is delivering real performance,” Garg said.</p>
<p>In a statement, VPC partner Gordon Watson said, “We have been impressed with the resilience and growth of the business and look forward to deepening our partnership with Kredivo. The company presents a unique combination of growth, scale, risk management and financial inclusion in one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As podcasting continues to gain ground among mainstream consumers as a digital media platform alongside music, video, and the printed word, a startup that made a name for itself through building content for the medium has closed a round of funding to help it explore what comes next.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.waitwhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaitWhat</a>, co-founded by two of the people who helped conceive of and build the TED digital media empire, has closed a round of $12 million, in a round led by Raga Partners, with Laurene Powell Jobs&#8217; firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson Collective, Lupa Systems, Capital One Ventures, Maywic Select Investments, GingerBread Capital, Burda Principal Investments, Cue Ball Capital, and Reid Hoffman</span> also participating.</p>
<p>WaitWhat says it plans to use the money to continue producing content in formats that have already proven very successful for it so far &#8212; to date, it has seen 70 million downloads of its work, which includes the podcasts Masters of Scale from Reid Hoffman, Meditative Story, Spark &amp; Fire, and Should this Exist? &#8212; as well as invest in its tech and R&amp;D and efforts to break new ground for new kinds of formats.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company may be best known for its podcast production, but it describes itself as a &#8220;media invention company&#8221; and June Cohen, who co-founded the company with Deron Triff, want to double down on the invention part of that description, going past podcasting to explore other ways of interacting with users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working on an innovative content format for physical well-being that lives inside of workouts, but will come at the experience through storytelling,&#8221; the pair said in an email (which we had to move to after our phone conversation, while they were on the road in a car, broke up. Maybe in-car calls need to be disrupted soon, too). &#8220;After physical well-being, we see intergenerational experiences (parent/child) as another interesting white space that plays into habit and human potential, and are in the early stages of developing a television series to explore this arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>An existing iteration on the podcast theme &#8212; a entrepreneur training course that it has developed in connection with its <span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale podcast, has been downloaded 10,000 times in its first 8 weeks on the market. And Meditative Story, which focuses on mindfulness, is being downloaded 750,000 times each month. In this they have focused on an important aspect of any digital service: &#8220;As with the podcast format, it&#8217;s all about habit,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p>But it is more than that: at a time when podcasting may still be somewhat nascent as a business model, while at the same time at the risk of starting to be too formulaic, the company&#8217;s catching attention for exploring ways to address both of those issues.</p>
<p>Its solution, in part, may be based on creative ways of presenting content to users, but also keeping a focus on strong material to use in those channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to build the most valuable independent portfolio of premium IP — one that&#8217;s designed around essential human needs and built with a contrarian strategy to scale,&#8221; the pair said in the email. &#8220;We see an outsized opportunity for alternative content that lives at the intersection of daily habit and fulfilling human potential. Our success is linked to how we build content ecosystems where habit and human potential come together.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is potentially a lot of money in making compelling podcasting content, of course, but for now a good chunk of that is coming in the form of M&amp;A, specifically from companies like Spotify looking to buy much bigger audiences that it can coalesce around its own advertising and paid subscription efforts, or by buying into new tech for creating and organizing this kind of content.</p>
<p>WaitWhat presents an interesting variation on that theme, by building a startup around the idea of innovating within and beyond the podcast medium, which could catch the eye again of the same players who are watching and snapping up content companies today.</p>
<p>Something interesting in how Cohen and Triff have approached fundraising is that they say that they have done it in part to &#8220;secure diversity&#8221; at the startup. In part this is about hiring people from a mix of backgrounds but also about how it approaches management and how it endorses those with whom it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see our fundraising rounds as a tool for securing diversity,&#8221; they noted. &#8220;We know that’s not a typical viewpoint. But we have found ways to use our fund-raising rounds to leap us forward on diversity — in a few different ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>They note that in the seed round, they raised half of the funds from investors who identify as women. &#8220;We did this by raising from women first. Most people thought we were crazy. (“Just take the money there you find it!” was the advice we got) But it’s what we believed in, and it’s what we did,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Then in the Series A (we covered it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/podcasting-startup-waitwhat-raises-4-3m-as-interest-in-audio-content-explodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), &#8220;our lead investors had diverse funds, but they weren’t women-led. So we created a carve-out to create balance. And raised additional funds from women-led funds to balance us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this latest Series B, &#8220;we shifted our focus from total dollars to representation on the Board,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We actually wrote into our term sheet that WaitWhat will always maintain gender balance on the board. In this round, we shifted to a 5-person board, so what that means is that we won’t have less than 2 people who identify as women — or less than 2 people who identify as men. Our investors haven’t seen a company request this before — but they welcomed it, and shared that they wished more companies would ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far from annoying the men in the room, it seems to have gotten them even more on board with the idea of purpose existing alongside business interestes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drawing on our background of investing in companies that have demonstrated the ability to build loyalty and community around high-quality content and experiences, we are big believers in WaitWhat’s approach to deliver durable and adaptive content, helping people become the best versions of themselves,” said Atul Joshi, founder and managing partner of Raga Partners, who led the investment for the firm. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[There have been further calls from EU institutions to outlaw biometric surveillance in public.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There have been further calls from EU institutions to outlaw biometric surveillance in public.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-edps-call-ban-use-ai-automated-recognition-human-features-publicly-accessible_en">joint opinion</a> published today, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiórowski, have called for draft EU regulations on the use of artificial intelligence technologies to go further than the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposal in April</a> &#8212; urging that the planned legislation should be beefed up to include a &#8220;general ban on any use of AI for automated recognition of human features in publicly accessible spaces, such as recognition of faces, gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals, in any context&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such technologies are simply too harmful to EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights and freedoms &#8212; like privacy and equal treatment under the law &#8212; to permit their use, is the argument.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EDPB is responsible for ensuring a harmonization application of the EU&#8217;s privacy rules, while the EDPS oversees EU institutions&#8217; own compliance with data protection law and also provides legislative guidance to the Commission.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers&#8217; draft proposal on regulating applications of AI contained restrictions on law enforcement’s use of biometric surveillance in public places &#8212; but with very wide-ranging exemptions which quickly attracted major criticism from digital rights and civil society groups, as well as a number of MEPs.</p>
<p>The EDPS himself also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">quickly urged a rethink</a>. Now he&#8217;s gone further, with the EDPB joining in with the criticism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KofcQJYvh9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MEPs call for European AI rules to ban biometric surveillance in public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/embed/#?secret=KofcQJYvh9" data-secret="KofcQJYvh9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The EDPB and the EDPS have jointly fleshed out a number of concerns with the EU&#8217;s AI proposal &#8212; while welcoming the overall &#8220;risk-based approach&#8221; taken by EU lawmakers &#8212; saying, for example, that legislators must be careful to ensure alignment with the bloc&#8217;s existing data protection framework to avoid rights risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB and the EDPS strongly welcome the aim of addressing the use of AI systems within the European Union, including the use of AI systems by EU institutions, bodies or agencies. At the same time, the EDPB and EDPS are concerned by the exclusion of international law enforcement cooperation from the scope of the Proposal,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPB and EDPS also stress the need to explicitly clarify that existing EU data protection legislation (GDPR, the EUDPR and the LED) applies to any processing of personal data falling under the scope of the draft AI Regulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as calling for the use of biometric surveillance to be banned in public, the pair have urged a total ban on AI systems using biometrics to categorize individuals into &#8220;clusters based on ethnicity, gender, political or sexual orientation, or other grounds on which discrimination is prohibited under Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting concern in light of Google&#8217;s push, in the adtech realm, to replace behavioral micromarketing of individuals with ads that address cohorts (or groups) of users, based on their interests &#8212; with such clusters of web users set to be defined by Google&#8217;s AI algorithms.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s interesting to speculate, therefore, whether<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/"> FLoCs</a> risks creating a legal discrimination risk &#8212; based on how individual mobile users are grouped together for ad targeting purposes. Certainly,<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"> concerns</a> have been raised over the potential for FLoCs to scale bias and predatory advertising. And it&#8217;s also interesting that Google avoided running early tests in Europe, likely owning to the EU&#8217;s data protection regime.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SJl7WZOVUX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">Google isn&#8217;t testing FLoCs in Europe yet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google isn&#8217;t testing FLoCs in Europe yet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/embed/#?secret=SJl7WZOVUX" data-secret="SJl7WZOVUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In another recommendation today, the EDPB and the EDPS also express a view that the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is &#8220;highly undesirable and should be prohibited&#8221; &#8212;  except for what they describe as &#8220;very specified cases, such as some health purposes, where the patient emotion recognition is important&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of AI for any type of social scoring should be prohibited,&#8221; they go on &#8212; touching on one use-case that the Commission&#8217;s draft proposal does suggest should be entirely prohibited, with EU lawmakers evidently keen to avoid any China-style social credit system taking hold in the region.</p>
<p>However by failing to include a prohibition on biometric surveillance in public in the proposed regulation the Commission is arguably risking just such a system being developed on the sly &#8212; i.e. by not banning private actors from deploying technology that could be used to track and profile people&#8217;s behavior remotely and en masse.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the EDPB&#8217;s chair Andrea Jelinek and the EDPS Wiewiórowski argue as much, writing [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Deploying remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces means the end of anonymity in those places. Applications such as live facial recognition interfere with fundamental rights and freedoms to such an extent that they may call into question the essence of these rights and freedoms. This calls for an immediate application of the precautionary approach. <strong>A general ban on the use of facial recognition in publicly accessible areas is the necessary starting point if we want to preserve our freedoms and create a human-centric legal framework for AI.</strong> The proposed regulation should also prohibit any type of use of AI for social scoring, as it is against the EU fundamental values and can lead to discrimination.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In their joint opinion they also express concerns about the Commission&#8217;s proposed enforcement structure for the AI regulation, arguing that data protection authorities (within Member States) should be designated as national supervisory authorities (&#8220;pursuant to Article 59 of the [AI] Proposal&#8221;) &#8212; pointing out the EU DPAs are already enforcing the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the LED (Law Enforcement Directive) on AI systems involving personal data; and arguing it would therefore be &#8220;a more harmonized regulatory approach, and contribute to the consistent interpretation of data processing provisions across the EU&#8221; if they were given competence for supervising the AI Regulation too.</p>
<p>They are also not happy with the Commission&#8217;s plan to give itself a predominant role in the planned European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB) &#8212; arguing that this &#8220;would conflict with the need for an AI European body independent from any political influence&#8221;. To ensure the Board&#8217;s independence the proposal should give it more autonomy and &#8220;ensure it can act on its own initiative&#8221;, they add.</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>The AI Regulation is one of a number of digital proposals unveiled by EU lawmakers in recent months. Negotiations between the different EU institutions &#8212; and lobbying from industry and civil society &#8212; continues as the bloc works toward adopting new digital rules.</p>
<p>In another recent and related development, the UK&#8217;s information commissioner warned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/uks-ico-warns-over-big-data-surveillance-threat-of-live-facial-recognition-in-public/">last week</a> over the threat posed by big data surveillance systems that are able to make use of technologies like live facial recognition &#8212; although she claimed it&#8217;s not her place to endorse or ban a technology.</p>
<p>But her opinion makes it clear that many applications of biometric surveillance may be incompatible with the UK&#8217;s privacy and data protection framework.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>A few Extra Crunch items highlight before we jump into things. This week, we published an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/refraction-ais-matthew-johnson-roberson-on-finding-the-middle-path-to-robotic-delivery/">Refraction AI co-founder and CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a> as part of an ongoing series focused on transportation founders. TechCrunch has been following autonomous delivery startup since it came out of stealth on our stage in 2019. Refraction, which built its vehicle to travel in bike lanes up to 15 miles per hour, has been testing in AnnArbor, Michigan. Now, it&#8217;s expanding to Austin. Our interview with Johnson-Roberson reveals the premise behind the company, what prompted him to step down as CEO and some of the challenges in the industry. The twist with this series? We plan to check in on every founder we interview a year after their Q&amp;A is published.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Later this month, we&#8217;ll feature an interview with Candice Xie, the CEO and co-founder of Veo.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a fresh round of recaps from the <strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong> event held June 9. Each recap provides a rundown of the conversation as well as some key quotes from our panelists. The recaps also include the video of the session.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Taking autonomous vehicle technology from the &#8220;lab,&#8221; — ok, from the closed track — to commercial scale is a pricey endeavor. Not every AV developer has success raising money or access to debt. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/"><strong>Waymo</strong> does</a>.</p>
<p>The company has raised another $2.5 billion in external funding about 15 months after its first external round brought in $2.25 billion. (That round was later expanded by $700 million a few months later.) The round appears to be mostly existing investors including parent company Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Magna International, Mubadala Investment Company, Perry Creek Capital, Silver Lake, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Temasek. Tiger Global was the investor newcomer.</p>
<p>The funding announcement comes a few months after CEO John Krafcik left the company after five years in the position. The CEO position is now being held jointly by Tekedra Mawakana, former COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, who joined the original self-driving project at Google and was CTO.</p>
<p>More than $2 billion is a hefty haul. Although numerous folks,  some of whom are in the financial sector, reached out to me to share reactions of surprise that it wasn&#8217;t larger. I&#8217;m more interested in how that money is being put to work. Waymo has now brought in nearly $6 billion in outside investment since March 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bringg</strong>, a software developer focused on helping retailers with last-mile logistics, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/bringg-nabs-100m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-last-mile-delivery-platform-for-retailers/">$100 million in a Series E round of funding</a> led by Insight Partners. Salesforce Ventures, Viola Growth, Next 47, Pereg Ventures, Harlap, GLP and Cambridge Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also invested. Bringg CEO Guy Bloch told TechCrunch that the funding will be used both to continue growing Bringg&#8217;s customer base, but also the company&#8217;s ca</p>
<p><strong>CAI International</strong>, the tansportation finance and logistics company,  agreed to a $1.1 billion takeover by Mitsubishi HC Capital. This is an all-stock deal that is comprised of $104 million worth of preferred stock and $986 million of common stock equity value, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cai-international-m-a-mitsubishi-hc-c/mitsubishi-hc-capital-to-buy-cai-international-for-1-1-billion-idUSKCN2DU001">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cambridge Mobile Telematics</strong>, a mobile telematics and analytics, has acquired TrueMotion. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the terms. CMT will now provide telematics services to 21 out of the 25 largest auto insurers in the United States, and across more than 20 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa, Japan and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the self-driving subsidiary of GM, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">secured a $5 billion line of credit</a> from the automaker&#8217;s financial arm to pay for hundreds of purpose-built electric and autonomous Origin vehicles as they start to roll off the assembly line. The access to the credit provided by GM Financial will push Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;total war chest&#8221; to more than $10 billion as it prepares for commercialization, CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a blog post. In short: the credit will be used to buy these Cruise Origins from GM, which is assembling the autonomous vehicles at its renamed and renovated Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. The factory is now called Factory ZERO.</p>
<p><strong>Electriphi</strong>, a battery management and fleet monitoring software startup based in San Francisco, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/">acquired by Ford</a>. The acquisition, the terms of which neither party would disclose, aims to round out Ford&#8217;s future EV commercial business. The automaker already has two electric commercial vehicles in pipeline, the  E-transit cargo and F-150 Lighting Pro pickup truck. Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Gopuff</strong>, the on-demand goods, food and alcohol delivery service, acquired fleet management platform<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/delivery-service-gopuff-acquires-rideos-for-115-million-plus/"> rideOS for $115 million</a>, sources familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. This acquisition comes just a few months after the Philadelphia-based startup announced a $1.15 billion funding round at a $8.9 billion valuation, up from $3.9 billion in October. Last fall, the company also raised $380 million and bought BevMo, a beverage retailer. Gopuff did not share its updated valuation with this new acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>KeepTruckin</strong>, a hardware and software developer that helps trucking fleets manage vehicle, cargo and driver safety, raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/keeptruckin-raises-190-million-to-invest-in-ai-products-double-rd-team-to-700/"> $190 million in a Series E funding round</a>, which puts the company&#8217;s valuation at over $2 billion, according to CEO Shoaib Makani. <strong>G2 Venture Partners</strong>, which just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/">raised a $500 million fund</a> to help modernize existing industries, participated in the round, alongside existing backers Greenoaks Capital, Index Ventures, IVP and Scale Venture Partners and funds managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup developing autonomous trucks, has a new investor. Tire-making giant Bridgestone has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/self-driving-trucks-startup-kodiak-robotics-snags-investment-partnership-from-bridgestone/">taken a minority stake</a> in the AV startup as part of a broader partnership to test and develop smart tire technology. While the terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, Kodiak Robotics co-founder and CEO Don Burnette told TechCrunch that this is a direct financial investment. Bridgestone CTO Nizar Trigui has also joined the Kodiak board as an observer. The two companies also formed a strategic partnership focused on advancing Bridgestone&#8217;s tire tech and fleet management system.</p>
<p><strong>MachineMetrics</strong>, a data startup focused on manufacturing, raised $20 million in Series B round led by industrial automation and robotics Teradyne. Ridgeline Ventures also participated along with existing investors Tola Capital and Hyperplane.</p>
<p><strong>Mister Car Wash</strong>, a car wash company owned by Leonard Green &amp; Partners and based in my hometown, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1853513/000119312521192606/d117644ds1a.htm">set the terms for its initial public offering</a>. The company said in a regulatory filing that it will issue 37.5 million with the expectation of a per share price between $15 and $17.</p>
<p><strong>Motorway</strong>, a U.K. startup that allows professional car dealers to bid in an auction for privately owned cars for sale,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/motorways-auction-platform-for-second-hand-cars-raises-67-7m-series-b-led-by-index-ventures/"> raised £48 million ($67.7 million)</a> in a Series B round led by Index Ventures, along with new investors BMW iVentures and Unbound. Existing investors Latitude and Marchmont Ventures also participated. The funding will be used to extend its platform and grow the current 160-strong team.</p>
<p><strong>PayCargo</strong>, the Freight payment platform company, <a href="https://paycargo.com/news/paycargo-secures-series-b/">raised $125 million</a> in a Series B round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Power</strong>, a solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, locked in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/bmw-and-ford-backed-solid-power-will-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-1-2b-deal/">deal to merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III, at a post-deal implied market valuation of $1.2 billion. The transaction is expected to generate around $600 million in cash, including a $165 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction from investors Koch Strategic Platforms, Riverstone Energy Limited, Neuberger Berman and Van Eck Associates Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Aerospace</strong> is yet another electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft startup to <a href="https://www.vertical-aerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pdf_Press_Release.pdf">take the SPAC path</a> to the public markets. The UK-based eVTOL developer, which is backed by American Airlines, Avolon, Honeywell, Rolls-Royce and Microsoft&#8217;s M12, has agreed to merge with special purposed acquisition company Broadstone Acquisition Corp., at an implied $2.2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Woven Capital made an undisclosed investment in Ridecell, a platform powering digital transformations and IoT automation for fleet-driven businesses. Woven Capital is an $800 million global investment fund that supports innovative, growth-stage companies in mobility, automation, artificial intelligence, data and analytics, connectivity, and smart cities. It is the investment arm of the Woven Planet Group, a Toyota subsidiary which is dedicated to building the safest mobility in the world. Along with the investment, Ridecell and the Woven Planet Group will explore collaborative opportunities in mobility service operations.</p>
<h2>Hints at Argo&#8217;s future</h2>

<p>You might have noticed under &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; that <strong>Ford</strong> acquired a fleet management and charging monitor software company called Electriphi. When the deal was announced, I found myself wondering aloud if the software would be used by the company for its eventual commercial fleet of robotaxis? And that got me thinking about Argo AI, the startup developing the self-driving system for backers Ford and VW.</p>
<p>I was pointed to some comments made Ford CEO Jim Farley, which suggests that maybe Argo will play a larger role in commercial operations than expected. Farley was asked during the Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Global Auto Industry Conference what he thought about the convergence between what Argo will be offering and I guess Ford in terms of business model?</p>
<p><strong>Farley&#8217;s response</strong>: &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a good question. I think Argo has proven to be very adaptive business, not just the technology. My personal opinion is that I think they deserve the opportunity to be a one-stop shop company and that they will take on more of the go-to-market responsibilities for our AV effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Welcome to Policy Corner. It&#8217;s a (relatively) short one this week folks. As a reminder, if there&#8217;s any policy or regulatory news (or tips!) that you think merits inclusion in the Corner, send me an email at <a href="mailto:aria.techcrunch@gmail.com">aria.techcrunch@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicle developers <strong>Nuro</strong> and <strong>Cruise</strong>, along with three other entities, have formed a new coalition to support a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB500">California bill</a> that would require AVs to be zero emission by 2030. TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan was the first to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">cover the bill</a> back in March. Notably absent from this coalition are Argo AI, which has Ford and VW has backers and customers, as well several other legacy automakers. John Davis, chief engineer at Ford Autonomous Vehicles, told Bellan back in March that the computing demands of an AV platform means that it may make more sense to transition first to a hybrid model before going full EV.</p>
<p>For Cruise&#8217;s part, it makes sense that they&#8217;d want to ratchet up their support of the bill, especially after news broke that earlier this week they&#8217;d taken out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion line of credit</a> to ramp up production of their electric Cruise Origin AV.</p>
<hr />
<p>EV proponents are fired up about the possibility of taxing EVs as one way to fund the massive infrastructure investments that are currently being debated in Washington. The proposal is being mulled by legislators as they continue to negotiate the infrastructure package. Joe Britton, the Executive Director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, called the tax proposal &#8220;the brainchild of those who want to unfairly punish EV drivers and hinder clean vehicle deployment.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that an EV tax could be the sacrificial lamb that some legislators are looking for, but it is important to note &#8212; as ZETA does &#8212; that battery electric vehicles are still only around 1% of the cars on the road.</p>

<p>Here are a few more final items to wrap up The Station.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Pony.ai,</strong> the robotaxi startup that operates in China and the United States, has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">testing driverless vehicles</a> on public roads in California ahead of plans to launch a commercial service there in 2022. The company said the driverless vehicle testing, which means the autonomous vehicles operate without human safety drivers behind the wheel, is happening daily on public roads in Fremont and Milpitas, California. Pony.ai is also testing its driverless vehicles in Guangzhou, China. Pony.ai said it also plans to resume a rideshare service to the public in Irvine this summer using AVs with a human safety driver. Its goal is to roll out the fully driverless service to the public in 2022.</p>
<h3>EVs and hydrogen</h3>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong>, the electric vehicle startup that recently became a publicly traded company through a merger with a SPAC, made a number of announcements during its investor day event. First on the list was news that the company plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">build a factory in Oklahoma</a> that will employ up to 2,000 workers. The factory will be located on a 400-acre site in the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma about 45 minutes from Tulsa. The facility, which the company describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; will include a paint shop, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023.</p>
<p>Canoo also laid out its plans for automated driving, which I haven&#8217;t heard much about until now. The details were thin, but Canoo is planning to have its vehicles equipped with &#8220;Level 2&#8221; advanced driver assistance system, which means two primary functions &#8212; like adaptive cruise and lane keeping &#8212; are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. From there, it seems the company is taking the Tesla approach and believes it can reach Level 4 autonomy through software improvements. To be clearm, Tesla is nowhere near Level 4 autonomy, which means the vehicle ccan handle all driving without the driver in the loop in certain geographic areas or conditiions. Here is the Canoo CTO&#8217;s comments about this.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got an ADAS system ready for launch at Level 2, with all of the basic features, but we&#8217;ve got an OTA system — over the air upgradability — so as we continue to refine and mature and validate additional features in ADAS, we&#8217;re going to be able to upgrade over time and with our ADAS compute platform, along with the sensor suite we believe will ultimately get us to around Level 4.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, the company also detailed some of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-wants-to-connect-owners-to-all-of-their-vehicles-not-just-canoos/">features that may be on its app</a>, including a one-stop shop functionality that customers could use for their Canoo vehicles &#8212; and all their other cars, as well. This unusual approach to its branded vehicle app could potentially pay off big-time for Canoo in terms of user data and revenue via sales on services like tire replacements and insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> is digging itself deeper into a hole it seems. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">CEO and CFO resigned</a> following a less than stellar first quarter results in May, including news that production volumes would likely be half &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 &#8212; should the company not identify more funding. But wait. What is this?</p>
<p>The following day, hope was restored when interim CEO Angela Strand and President Rich Schmidt made a series of statements  at an Automotive Press Association event that drove up shares in the company, including that it has enough &#8220;binding orders&#8221; from customers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/">fund limited production</a> of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. Ah but hold tight because the next day Lordstown issued a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/">reversed those claims</a>.</p>
<p>It appears those &#8220;binding orders&#8221; were more like agreements to <em>maybe</em> lease or buy.</p>
<p><strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong> is developing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/jaguar-land-rover-to-develop-a-defender-like-hydrogen-fuel-cell-ev/">hydrogen fuel cell vehicle</a> based on the new Defender SUV, and plans to begin testing the prototype next year. The prototype program, known as Project Zeus, is part of JLR&#8217;s larger aim to only produce zero-tailpipe emissions vehicles by 2036. JLR has also made a commitment to have zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039. The automaker has also tapped AVL, Delta Motorsport, Marelli Automotive Systems and the U.K. Battery Industrialization Center to help develop the prototype.</p>
<p><strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery startup, is expanding into parcel logistics through a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/"> partnership with FedEx</a>. The multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership aims to test and ultimately deploy Nuro&#8217;s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. This bot will follow Nuro&#8217;s more recent R2 bot. The deal with FedEx marks its first foray into parcels logistics. The pilot program has already started in Houston. This multiyear commitment will allow Nuro to bring its technology to more people in new ways, and eventually reach large-scale deployment, according to Cosimo Leipold, Nuro&#8217;s head of partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong>, Volvo Car Group&#8217;s standalone electric performance brand, will manufacture its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/polestar-to-build-its-first-all-electric-suv-in-the-united-states/">first all-electric SUV</a> in the United States. The automaker said the Polestar 3 will be assembled at a plant shared with Volvo Cars at a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina. The Polestar 3 follows the all-electric Polestar 2 sedan and the hybrid grand tourer Polestar 1. Production of Polestar 3 is expected to begin globally in 2022.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> entered into an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210617005933/en/">agreement with Ferrari</a> to become their official cloud provider, a deal that aims to help the luxury automaker&#8217;s Scuderia Ferrari Formula One racing team launch a digital fan engagement platform <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">via its mobile app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Android Auto</strong> has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-summer-2021">some new updates</a> including personalizing the launcher screen directly from a user&#8217;s smartphone and manually setting dark mode. Browsing content is also supposed to be easier with new tabs in media apps, a &#8220;back to top&#8221; option and an A to Z button in the scroll bar.  New app experiences have also been added to help with EV charging, parking and navigation apps are now available to use in Android Auto. Users will also be able to read and send new messages directly from apps like WhatsApp or Messages &#8212; now available globally. These Android Auto features are available on phones running Android 6.0 or above, and when connected to your compatible car.</p>
<h3>Other transportation stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Financial Times</strong> digs into the sticky issue of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/76fdac7c-7076-47a4-bcb0-7e75af0aadab">Chinese surveillance technology</a> that is used in &#8216;smart cities&#8217; all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> upped the amount it says it will spend on electric and autonomous vehicle investments to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion through 2025</a> &#8212; an $8 billion increase from its previous plan announced in November 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Lux Research </strong>released a study showing that in 2020 <a href="https://www.luxresearchinc.com/hubfs/2021%20Files/2021%20Executive%20Summaries/2021%20Press%20Executive%20Summaries/Executive%20Summary%20-%20Automotive%20Battery%20Tracker%202020%20Update%20-%20Press.pdf?utm_campaign=2021.06.17%20Automotive%20Battery%20Tracker%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=134312398&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YOW1Cnj4_pA3xyvgDdGIIjrYHK7GdjXCGxE17RLh0JjarrueIF5oLCkwzljhX9B6oEA2PWEEphVrkmguB1lsV16cYKw&amp;utm_content=134311174&amp;utm_source=hs_email">electric vehicles sales</a>, meaning battery and plug-ins, increased 37% compared to 2019. The sales growth was led by 140% growth in Europe as the BEV market took off in several countries. The report noted that while Tesla remains the most popular BEV maker, but its choice of cells from LG Energy Solution in China means Panasonic lost the market share crown it had held since 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Redwood Materials</strong>, the battery recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has purchased 100 acres of land <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">near the Gigafactory</a> that Panasonic operates with Tesla in Sparks, Nevada as part of an expansion plan that aligns with the Biden Administration&#8217;s drive to increase adoption of electric vehicles and boost domestic battery recycling and supply chain efforts. The company said its existing 150,000-square-foot facility in Carson City, Nevada will also nearly triple in size. Redwood is adding another 400,000 square feet onto the Carson City recycling facility, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As enterprise startups continue to target interesting gaps in the market, we&#8217;re seeing increasingly sophisticated tools getting built for small and medium businesses &#8212; traditionally a tricky segment to sell to, too small for large enterprise tools, and too advanced in their needs for consumer products. In the latest development of that trend, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.datarails.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataRails</a> has raised $25 million to continue building out a platform that lets SMBs using Excel to run financial planning and analytics like their larger counterparts.</p>
<p>The funding closes out the company&#8217;s Series A at $43.5 million, after the company <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/641342/DataRails-Secures-185-Million-Series-A-Led-by-Zeev-Ventures-to-Bring-Enterprise-Level-Financial-Planning-Solution-to-SMBs">initially raised $18.5 million in April</a> (some at the time reported this as its Series A, but it seems the round had yet to be completed). The full round includes Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel, and Innovation Endeavors, with <span class="s3">Vintage Investment Partners added in this most recent tranche. DataRails is not disclosing its valuation, except to note that it has doubled in the last four months, with hundreds of customers and on target to cross 1,000 this year, with a focus on the North American market. It has raised $55 million in total. </span></p>
<p>The challenge that DataRails has identified is that on one hand, SMBs have started to adopt a lot more apps, including software delivered as a service, to help them manage their businesses &#8212; a trend that has been accelerated in the last year with the pandemic and the knock-on effect that has had for remote working and bringing more virtual elements to replace face-to-face interactions. Those apps can include Salesforce, NetSuite, Sage, SAP, QuickBooks, Zuora, Xero, ADP and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But on the other hand, those in the business who manage its finances and financial reporting are lacking the tools to look at the data from these different apps in a holistic way. While Excel is a default application for many of them, they are simply reading lots of individual spreadsheets rather than integrated data analytics based on the numbers.</p>
<p>DataRails has built a platform that can read the reported information, which typically already lives in Excel spreadsheets, and automatically translate it into a bigger picture view of the company.</p>
<p>For SMEs, Excel is such a central piece of software, yet such a pain point for its lack of extensibility and function, that this predicament was actually the germination of starting DataRails in the first place,</p>
<p class="p1">Didi Gurfinkel, the CEO who co-founded the company with Eyal Cohen (the CPO) said that DataRails’ initially set out to create a more general purpose product that could help analyze and visualize anything from Excel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2168009" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="428" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DataRails-PR-Image-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;We started the company with a vision to save the world from Excel spreadsheets,&#8221; he said, by taking them and helping to connect the data contained within them to a structured database. &#8220;The core of our technology knows how to take unstructured data and map that to a central database.&#8221; Before 2020, DataRails (which was founded in 2015) applied this to a variety of areas with a focus on banks, insurance companies, compliance and data integrity.</p>
<p>Over time, it could see a very specific application emerging, specifically for SMEs: providing a platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning and analytics), which didn&#8217;t really have a solution to address it at the time. &#8220;So we enabled that to beat the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re already investing so much time and money in their software, but they still don’t have analytics and insight,&#8221; said Gurfinkel.</p>
<p>That turned out to be fortunate timing, since &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; and getting more out of one&#8217;s data was really starting to get traction in the world of business, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/small-business-digital-transformation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specifically in the world of SMEs</a>, and CFOs and other people who oversaw finances were already looking for something like this.</p>
<p>The typical DataRails customer might be as small as a business of 50 people, or as big as 1,000 employees, a size of business that is too small for enterprise solutions, &#8220;which can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implement and use,&#8221; added Cohen, among other challenges. But as with so many of the apps that are being built today to address those using Excel, the idea with DataRails is low-code or even more specifically no-code, which means &#8220;no IT in the loop,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we are so successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are crossing the barrier and making our solution easy to use.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">The company doesn&#8217;t have a huge number of competitors today, either, although companies like <a href="https://www.cubesoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cube</a> (which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/cube-raises-10m-more-to-help-companies-plan-their-financial-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised some money</a>) are among them. And others like Stripe, while currently not focussing on FP&amp;A, have most definitely been expanding the tools that it is providing to businesses as part of their bigger play to manage payments and subsequently other processes related to financial activity, so perhaps it, or others like it, might at some point become competitors in this space as well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gurfinkel said that other areas that DataRails is likely to expand to cover alongside FP&amp;A are likely to include HR, inventory, and &#8220;planning for anything,&#8221; any process that you have running in Excel. Another interesting turn would be how and if DataRails decides to look beyond Excel at other spreadsheets, or bypass spreadsheets altogether.</p>
<p>The scope of the opportunity &#8212; in the U.S. alone there are more than 30 million small businesses &#8212; is what&#8217;s attracting the investment here.</p>
<p class="p5">“We’re thrilled to reinvest in DataRails and continue working with the team to help them navigate their recent explosive and rapid growth,” said Yanai Oron, General Partner at <span class="s6">Vertex Ventures, in a statement</span>. “With innovative yet accessible technology and a tremendous untapped market opportunity, DataRails is primed to scale and become the leading FP&amp;A solution for SMEs everywhere.”</p>
<p class="p5">“Businesses are constantly about to start, in the midst of, or have just finished a round of financial reporting—it’s a never-ending cycle,&#8221; added Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures. &#8220;But with DataRails, FP&amp;A can be simple, streamlined, and effective, and that’s a vision we’ll back again and again.”<br />

<p>Interestingly, those revenue figures have been adjusted to include fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets — it means that Revolut holds some crypto assets on its balance sheet. Revolut made $54 million (£39 million) in fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<p>Gross profit reached $170 million (£123 million) last year. At the same time, the company still reports operating losses. In particular, Q1 2020 was a particularly bad quarter with $76 million (£55 million) in adjusted operating loss.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2020, total non-adjusted operating loss reached $277 million (£200.6 million). Like many tech companies, administrative expenses are responsible for this loss. With a staff of 2,200 people, the company spent $367 million (£266 million) on administrative costs alone. But things seem to be improving as you can see:</p>

<p>These trends aren’t that surprising as I reported that fintech startups spent most of 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/fintech-startups-are-increasingly-focusing-on-profitability/">focusing on profitability and improving their margins</a>. At the end 2020, Revolut had 14.5 million personal customers and 500,000 companies using Revolut Business.</p>

<p>“As the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 drove the trend towards digital financial management we continued to innovate for customers to make their financial lives easier and accelerate daily use. We launched 24 new retail and business products, expanded into the US, Japan and Australia and launched banking services in Lithuania, all while significantly improving our profitability,” founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a statement. “We began 2021 with a more resilient and productive business that will enhance our trajectory towards rapid growth.”</p>
<p>When you compare Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, things are radically different for the fintech company. Revenue increased by 130% year-over-year and gross profit grew by 300% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Revolut has been launching a ton of products to diversify its sources of revenue. It is increasingly becoming a financial super app with current accounts, debit cards, trading services, insurance products, premium subscriptions, cryptocurrency trading and more.</p>
<p>Interestingly, interchange revenue from card transactions represents a good chunk of the company’s revenue. In 2020, cards and interchange generated $131 million (£95 million) in revenue. Every time a Revolut customer makes a card purchase, the card scheme (Visa or Mastercard) gives back some fees to Revolut. It’s an incredibly small percentage-based fee, but it can add up when you generate millions of purchases.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange and wealth generated $111 million (£80 million) in revenue. That’s another big one. And finally, subscriptions, such as Revolut Plus, Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal, accounted for $104 million (£75 million) in revenue.</p>
<p>Those are three strong pillars that all contribute to the company’s bottom line. They all represent a bit less or a bit more than a third of the company’s overall revenue.</p>

<p>While the company has expanded aggressively over the years, the U.K. is still by far its biggest market. In 2020, 88.4% of the company’s (non-adjusted) revenue was related to its activities in the U.K. The European Economic Area without the U.K. represented 10.2% of revenue. The U.S., Japan, Australia and other markets were nearly negligible.</p>
<p>Revolut has also raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/revolut-extends-series-d-round-to-580-million-with-80-million-in-new-funding/">mega round</a> of funding in 2020 —&nbsp;a $500 million Series D round that was extended to $580 million in total. I wouldn’t be surprised if the company launches an initial public offering within the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In April, Facebook announced a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">planned investments in new audio products</a>, including a Clubhouse live audio competitor as well as new support for podcasts. Today, Facebook is officially rolling these products with the launch of Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. on iOS, starting with public figures and select Facebook Groups, and the debut of an initial set of U.S. podcast partners.</p>
<p>The company tells us Live Audio Rooms will become available to any verified public figure or creator in the U.S. who&#8217;s in good standing with Facebook and is using either a profile or the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-page-experience/">new Facebook Pages experience</a> on iOS. For Facebook Groups, the feature is launching with &#8220;dozens of groups,&#8221; we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Both products will become more broadly available in the weeks and months ahead, as more people, podcasts, and Groups are brought on board. Meanwhile, 100% of Facebook users in the U.S. will be able to listen to Live Audio Rooms and podcasts as of this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Much like Clubhouse or similar audio apps, Facebook&#8217;s Live Audio Rooms offer a standard set of features.</p>
<p>The event’s hosts appear in rounded profile icons at the top of the screen, while the listeners appear in the bottom half of the screen, as smaller icons. The active speaker is indicated with a glowing ring. If verified, a check appears next to their name, as well.</p>
<p>There are also options for enabling live captions, a &#8220;raise hand&#8221; tool to request to speak, and tools to share the room with others on Facebook, through things like News Feed or Group posts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167908" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167908" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?w=351" alt="" width="351" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=768,1486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=794,1536 794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NF-Rooms-tray.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167908" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook does things a little differently than others in some places. For instance, hosts are able to invite people to join them as a speaker in advance of the session, or they can choose listeners during the stream to join them. In each session, there can be up to 50 speakers and there&#8217;s no limit on the number of listeners, Facebook says.</p>
<p>During the session, users will be notified when friends or followers join the chat, too.</p>
<p>While listening, users can &#8220;Like&#8221; or react to the content as it streams using the &#8220;Thumbs Up&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen which connects you to Facebook&#8217;s set of emoji reactions. And with today&#8217;s official launch, listeners can also now show support to the public figure of the Live Audio Room by sending &#8220;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172">Stars</a>.&#8221; These Stars can be purchased during the conversation and used at any time, similar to how they work with other Facebook Live content.</p>
<p>By sending Stars, the listener is bumped up to the &#8220;Front Row,&#8221; a special section that highlights the people who sent the Stars. This allows the event&#8217;s hosts to easily recognize their supporters and even give them a shout out during the event, if they choose.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167911" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167911" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167911" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?w=351" alt="" width="351" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=768,1486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=794,1536 794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Stars.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167911" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature allows hosts to select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation, and listeners and speakers can directly donate. A progress bar will show how much has been raised during the show.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167909" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167909" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?w=351" alt="" width="351" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=155,300 155w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=768,1486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=351,680 351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=794,1536 794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Donations.png?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167909" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for Facebook Groups, admins can control whether moderators, group members or other admins can create a Live Audio Room. Both members and visitors can listen to the rooms in public groups, but in private groups, the rooms are limited to Group members.</p>
<p>Facebook users are alerted to all the new Live Audio Rooms via the News Feed and Notifications, and can sign up to be reminded when a room they&#8217;re interested in goes Live. Live Audio Rooms will also be discoverable within Facebook Groups, where available.</p>

<p>Alongside the launch of Live Audio Rooms, Facebook is also beginning to roll out its planned podcast support with a few select creators. These include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialjoebudden">Joe Budden</a> of The Joe Budden Podcast; “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JessHilarious">Jess Hilarious</a>” of Carefully Reckless from The Black Effect Podcast Network and iHeartRadio; Keltie Knight, Becca Tobin, and Jac Vanek of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/858364947626265">The LadyGang</a>; and Nicaila Matthews Okome of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SideHustlePro">Side Hustle Pro</a>. Facebook will open up to other podcasters this summer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167919" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167919" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167919" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="410" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png 1660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Podcasts-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167919" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>To be clear, this new podcasts service is different from the recently launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">music and podcasts player in partnership with Spotify</a>, which lets users share content from Spotify to the social network. The new feature instead involves podcasts that are streamed via public RSS feeds directly on Facebook, not delivered by Spotify. However, the miniplayer for podcasts on Facebook will look like the miniplayer for the Spotify listening integration (also known as Project Boombox), and they will behave similarly. But they are not the same.</p>
<p>The new podcast listening experience lets users listen to podcasts as they browse Facebook, either in a miniplayer or fullscreen player with playback options, and even if the phone&#8217;s display is turned off. This makes Facebook, in a way, a native podcast streaming app because it allows people to listen to audio without needing another service &#8212; like Spotify or Apple Podcasts, for example.</p>
<p>Facebook had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/"> earlier said</a> there are over 170 Facebook users who are connected to a Page for a podcast, demonstrating user interest in podcasts on its social network.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167924" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167924" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167924" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?w=349" alt="" width="349" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg 843w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=154,300 154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=768,1495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=349,680 349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=789,1536 789w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JoeBudden.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167924" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>With the launch of the Facebook Podcast service, the company is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/podcast_terms">asking podcast creators to give it permission</a> to cache their content on Facebook&#8217;s servers, which we&#8217;re told is being done to ensure the content doesn&#8217;t violate Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards. However, because the podcasts are still being streamed via RSS feeds, they will be represented in the metrics provided by a podcaster&#8217;s hosting provider.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537023/facebook-podcast-rss-feed-publish-clips-pages?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">Last week, Facebook emailed</a> podcast page owners details on how to set up their show on Facebook, noting they can link their podcast&#8217;s RSS feed to automatically generate News Feed posts for their episodes. These are also featured on a &#8220;podcasts&#8221; tab on their Page. According to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/podcast_terms">Podcast Terms of Service</a>, creators are granting Facebook the right to create &#8220;derivative works,&#8221; which likely refers to an upcoming clips feature.</p>
<p>Facebook says later this summer, it will add the ability to create and share short clips from a podcast, along with other features, like captions. Longer-term, it will create social experiences around podcasts, as well. It&#8217;s also working with creators to develop and launch its new product, Soundbites, which are short-form, creative audio clips. This will launch later in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167923" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167923" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167923" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?w=349" alt="" width="349" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg 843w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=154,300 154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=768,1495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=349,680 349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=789,1536 789w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FB_Podcast_JessHilarious.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167923" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Other audio products in the works include a central listening destination and background audio listening for videos.</p>
<p>Facebook says this new destination will be a place where all the different audio formats across Facebook are available, not just podcasts, and will help users find to new things and people to listen to. More details on this project will become available later this summer.</p>
<p>Prior to today, Facebook quietly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-begins-testing-clubhouse-rival-expanding-audio-suite">tested</a> Live Audio Rooms in Taiwan and internally with Facebook employees Those tests will continue. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-hosts-first-test-of-live-audio-rooms-in-u-s/">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg hosted the first trial</a> of the new service in the U.S., where he was joined by other Facebook execs and a few Facebook Gaming creators.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has been bullish on the potential for audio across the social networking platform. He even appeared on Clubhouse a couple of times to discuss the topic ahead of announcing what is, essentially, Facebook&#8217;s own Clubhouse competitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the areas where I’m most excited about it on Facebook are basically in the large number of communities and groups that exist,&#8221; Zuckerberg had told <a href="https://www.platformer.news/subscribe">Platformer</a>, at the time of the original announcement. &#8220;I think that you already have these communities that are organized around interests, and allowing people to come together and have rooms where they can talk is — I think it’d be a very useful thing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Facebook expects to expand its audio products globally in the months ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany&#8217;s competition authority, the FCO, has completed its Big Tech GAFA &#8216;bingo&#8217; card by opening a proceeding against Apple.</p>
<p>As with similar investigations already opened this year &#8212; into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google</a> &#8212; the proceeding will determine whether or not the iPhone maker meets the threshold of Germany&#8217;s updated competition law.</p>
<p>The 10th amendment to the law, which came into force in January, enables the <em>Bundeskartellamt</em> to intervene proactively against the practices of large digital companies &#8212; if they are determined to have &#8220;paramount significance for competition across markets&#8221; and in order to prevent them from engaging in anti-competitive practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discussing the key new provision to the Competition Act (aka, the GWB Digitalisation Act and specifically Section 19a) &#8212; in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">panel discussion last week</a>, the FCO&#8217;s president, Andreas Mundt, explained that the competition law update had been influenced by its experience with a long running (and pioneering) case against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling of Internet users</a>.</p>
<p>The upshot is that German competition law now has a theory of harm which entwines competition law and data protection &#8212; albeit, in the case of Apple, its tech empire is typically associated with defence (rather than abuse) of user privacy.</p>
<p>But the comprehensive amendments to German antitrust law are broadly targeted at Big Tech, with the goal of keeping markets open, fostering innovation and putting a stop to any abusive behavior, via provisions the FCO will be able to order &#8212; such an banning or restricting self-preferencing and bundling; or stopping giants tying products together to try to muscle into adjacent markets; or preventing them blocking interoperability and data access to try to lock out rivals, to name a few.</p>
<p>A mix of provisions are likely to be deployed, as tech giants are designated as addressable under the law, depending on the specifics of each case and the particular ecosystem business. So how it will operate in practice remains to be seen. So far the FCO is still in the process of determining (in each case) whether it can apply the law against GAFA.</p>
<p>For the Apple proceeding, Mundt said in a statement today that its operation of the App Store will be a &#8220;main focus&#8221; for the investigation because he said it &#8220;enables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>“We will now examine whether with its proprietary operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem around its iPhone that extends across several markets,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Apple produces tablets, computers and wearables and provides a host of device-related services. In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ as well as other services as part of its services business. Besides assessing the company’s position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/21_06_2021_Apple.html;jsessionid=3BE5BF223F8A517B1CB5906C695F23C9.2_cid378">FCO also noted</a> that it has received a number of complaints against Apple &#8220;relating to potentially anti-competitive practices&#8221; &#8212; such as one from the advertising and media industry against Apple restricting user tracking with the introduction of its iOS 14.5 operating system; and a complaint against the exclusive pre-installation of the company’s own applications as a possible type of self-preferencing prohibited under Section 19a GWB.</p>
<p>&#8220;App developers also criticise the mandatory use of Apple’s own in-app purchase system (IAP) and the 30% commission rate associated with this,&#8221; it added in a press release. &#8220;In this context, the marketing restrictions for app developers in Apple’s App Store are also addressed. The latter complaint has much in common with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">European Commission’s ongoing proceeding against Apple</a> for imposing restrictions on the streaming service Spotify and accordingly preferencing its own services. Where necessary, the Bundeskartellamt will establish contact with the European Commission and other competition authorities in this regard. So far, no decision on initiating a further proceeding has been taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple was contacted for comment on the FCO&#8217;s proceeding and it sent us this statement, attributed to a spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="il">Apple</span> is proud to be an engine for innovation and job creation, with more than 250,000 jobs supported by the iOS app economy in Germany. The App Store’s economic growth and activity have given German developers of all sizes the same opportunity to share their passion and creativity with users around the world while creating a secure and trusted place for customers to download the apps they love with the privacy protections they expect. Germany is also home to <span class="il">Apple</span>’s largest engineering hub in Europe, and a new €1BN investment in our European Silicon Design Center in Munich. We look forward to discussing our approach with the FCO and having an open dialogue about any of their concerns.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Once issued by the FCO, a &#8216;paramount significance&#8217; finding lasts for five years &#8212; while any legal challenges to orders made under Section 19a are intentionally expedited, with appeals going direct to Germany&#8217;s Federal Court of Justice (which is given exclusive competence). The goal being to avoid long drawn out litigations, as has occurred in the FCO&#8217;s case against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling &#8212; which had legal questions referred to the CJEU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">back in March</a>, some five years after the <em>Bundeskartellamt</em> began looking into Facebook’s data practices.</p>
<p>The coming months and years could be highly significant to how GAFA is able to operate in Europe&#8217;s largest economy &#8212; and, likely by extension, further afield in Europe and beyond as a number of jurisdictions are now paying active attention to how to regulate Big Tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Back in March</a>, for example, the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority opened its own probe into Apple&#8217;s App Store. Simultaneously it&#8217;s working on reforming national law to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">create a &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; for regulating tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>While, last December, European Union lawmakers proposed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a> &#8212; also aiming to tackle the power market of so-called &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">FTC appointing Lina Khan as chair</a> also appears to signify a change of direction on tech antitrust over in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sari-sari stores are neighborhood stores in the Philippines that usually sell daily necessities and sometimes serve as community hubs, too. Today<a href="https://growsari.com/"> GrowSari</a>, a startup that is digitizing sari-sari stores with features like pricing tools, inventory management and working capital loans, announced it has raised a Series B from several notable investors that brings its total funding to $30 million.</p>
<p>The company’s Series B is at a rolling close, so it has not announced a final amount. The $30 million total it has raised include its seed funding and Series A, which <a href="https://the-ken.com/sea/story/growsaris-key-to-the-philippines-sari-sari-treasure/">according to the Ken was $14 million</a>. Participants in its Series B included Temasek Holdings’ private equity unit Pavilion Capital, Tencent, International Finance Corporation (IFC), ICCP SBI Venture Partners and Saison Capital, and returning investors Robinsons Retail Holdings (which is part of the Gokongwei Group), JG Digital Equity Ventures and Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>GrowSari was founded in 2016, and says its B2B platform is currently used by more than 50,000 stores in over 100 municipalities on Luzon, the Philippines’ largest and most populated island. Its ultimate goal is to serve one million sari-sari stores.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s Khatabook raises $60 million to help merchants digitize bookkeeping and accept payments online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/embed/#?secret=Im8Yd6x2jZ" data-secret="Im8Yd6x2jZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to GrowSari, there are more than 1.1 million sari-sari stores in the Philippines, and they account for 60% of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sold in the country, making them a valuable distribution channel for wholesalers. In addition to its supplier marketplace, GrowSari says it is able to give sari-sari store operators better pricing for products from about a thousand FMCG brands, including Unilever, P&amp;G and Nestle, which it claims can help stores double their earnings. Other services in the app include online telecom and utility bill payments, remittance and microfinancing for working capital loans.</p>
<p>GrowSari’s founding team includes Reymund Rollan, Shiv Choudhury, Siddhartha Kongara and Andrzej Ogonowski, who first launched the platform as a backend system for sari-sari stores to manage their logistics and inventory.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167965" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167965" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2167965" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg?w=306" alt="A screenshot of product categories in GrowSari's app" width="306" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg?resize=68,150 68w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg?resize=135,300 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg?resize=306,680 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Categories.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2167965" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of product categories in GrowSari&#8217;s app</p></div></p>
<p>Since most sari-sari stores are run individually, their margins are smaller than large retailers that can negotiate deals with FMCG wholesalers. GrowSari’s supplier marketplace addresses this issue by giving sari-sari stores access the Distributor List Prices seen by large stores and wholesalers. GrowSari’s marketplace does not require a minimum order, and it allows sari-sari stores on the platform to pay with cash on delivery, GrowCoins (or cash credits that can be topped up through GrowSari’s shippers, online transfers, banks or over-the-counter at convenience stores) or E-Lista, GrowSari’s seven-day loan product.</p>
<p>GrowSari’s new capital will be used to expand its userbase to 300,000 new stores in the Philippines, especially in Visayas and Mindanao, increase the size of its supplier marketplace and launch more financial products for sari-sari stores. The startup is part of a new crop of B2B platforms in Asia focused on serving micro to small-enterprises, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/">BukuWarung</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">BukuKas</a> in Indonesia and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">Khatabook in Indi</a>a.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More mainstream venture capital firms are jumping on the crypto bandwagon as investors increasingly consider bitcoin an investable asset, despite the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/bitcoin-crashes-as-investors-fear-crypto-bull-market-could-be-nearing-its-end/">massive price drops</a> of a few major cryptocurrencies. Amber Group, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency trading startup, said on Monday it has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round at a pre-money valuation of $1 billion.</p>
<p>The latest valuation is ten times that of the company&#8217;s Series A closed in 2019, a $28 million round that counted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/coinbase-ventures/">Coinbase Ventures</a> as one of its investors. Also notably, Amber&#8217;s Series B financing was bankrolled by a list of high-profile financial and VC firms, including China Renaissance, which led the round, and Tiger Brokers, Tiger Global Management, Arena Holdings, Tru Arrow Partners, Sky9 Capital, DCM Ventures, and Gobi Partners.</p>
<p>Its past investors Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Blockchain.com also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In May, Babel Finance, another crypto asset manager based out of Hong Kong, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/babel-40-million-funding/">secured $40 million in funding</a> from a number of big-name institutional investors, including Amber&#8217;s investor Tiger Global.</p>
<p>Founded by a group of former investment bankers in their twenties, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amber <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/02/14/crypto-heavyweights-coinbase-polychain-and-paradigm-invest-28-million-in-hong-kong-crypto-trading-firm/?sh=3435c9e0b833">initially set out to apply machine learning algorithms to quantitative trading</a> but pivoted in 2017 to crypto when the team saw spikes in virtual currency&#8217;s trading volumes. The startup now serves </span>both institutional and individual investors, offering them algorithmic trading, electronic market-making, high-frequency trading, OTC trading, borrowing and lending, derivatives, among other products.</p>
<p>The firm launched its mobile app in the third quarter of 2020, widening its scope from institutional clients to retail consumers. It said the trading app has so far accumulated over 100,000 registered users.</p>
<p>Amber has been profitable since its inception, according to its co-founder and CEO Michael Wu, with annualized revenues of $500 million based on figures from January to April 2021.</p>
<p>The startup has seen &#8220;record months over the past quarter across both client flow and on-exchange market-making volumes,&#8221; said Wu, and it now accounts for &#8220;2-3% of total trading volumes in major spot and derivative markets.&#8221; Its cumulative trading volumes have doubled from $250 billion since the beginning of the year to over $500 billion. Altogether, it manages around $1.5 billion in trading capital that varies based on BTC and ETH prices.</p>
<p>Amber has over 330 employees worldwide across Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, and Vancouver. The proceeds from its Series B will go towards global expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, on Juneteenth, we recognize the efforts this nation still needs to put toward addressing structural racism and disparities, including in the world of tech.</p>
<p>This week, HBCUvc, a nonprofit that aims to diversify the world of venture capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/hbcuvc-venture-capital-lab-fund-1-million/">launched a million-dollar fund.</a> Founder Hadiyah Mujhid told me that the capital would provide nondilutive financing to overlooked founders, which they define as Black, Indigenous and LatinX entrepreneurs, replacing the traditional angel round. But she also admitted that supporting founders wasn’t the only primary goal. Instead, she explained to me the importance of what she defines as “teaching capital.”</p>
<p>Similar to how teaching hospitals give aspiring doctors a way to practice and learn their craft before formally entering the field, the fund wants to do that for their some 230 aspiring investors that they already work with, many stemming from historically Black colleges and universities. Notably, nondilutive capital provides entrepreneurs with funding sans equity and a learning experience with lower stakes.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of organizations right now that are starting funds [with] the primary goal of supporting founders. And that’s a goal of ours, but we’re hoping to have a ripple effect of training and really providing on-ramps for the next best-in-class investors … and in order to do that, they have to have a training vehicle.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’m not always a fan of rebranded names for capital, “teaching capital” is certainly a compelling framing. Track record is everything in this industry, and underrepresented folks often don’t have the benefit or privilege of access on their side — from a dollar or deals perspective. Scout programs have long existed to fill this gap, but I think that there is still a lacking of intentionality around who feels empowered to write an investment memo, ask questions and be new. This week, BLCK VC <a href="https://twitter.com/BLCKVC/status/1405279760624754688">launched its scout program</a> and Google for Startups launched a nondilutive financing instrument for Black founders, underscoring a growing focus in seeding diverse entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>HBCUvc’s fund was announced nearly one year after it almost shut down due to a lack of capital. Mujhid explained how the unjust killing of George Floyd led to the biggest one-day donation in her nonprofit&#8217;s lifetime, which “changed the trajectory of programming.” She also said that a lot of interest was a knee-jerk reaction, urging people to view this work as a long-term commitment.</p>

<p>Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving arm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/waymo-alphabets-self-driving-arm-raises-2-5b-in-second-external-investment-round/">raised $2.5 billion</a> in its second-ever institutional round. Investors include Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Temasek and, of course, Tiger Global.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Waymo is going external after some internal shuffling. The funding comes only months after CEO John Krafcik stepped down from his title after spending five years in that position. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">Waymo lost its CFO and head of partnerships.</a></p>

<p>Another week, another EC-1! Marcella McCarthy wrote about Nubank, a Brazillian credit card and banking fintech company that just last week raised at a $30 billion valuation. It’s one of the most valuable startups in the world, with over 40 million users.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>As McCarthy puts it in the piece, Nubank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-origin/">started </a>by trying to solve a massive challenge: “How to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.” Maybe, the story goes on to tell, it would start with California Street.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re looking at more Clubhouse competitors, including Facebook&#8217;s first test of its Live Audio Rooms in the U.S. and Spotify&#8217;s launch of its Greenroom app for live discussions across an array of topics. Also, Amazon is reducing its Appstore fees, after similar moves by Apple and Google.</p>

<h3>Spotify launches its Clubhouse competitor</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2166706" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166706" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2166706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=1536,586 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshots.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>In March, Spotify announced it was acquiring the company behind the sports-focused audio app Locker Room to help speed its entry into the live audio market. This week, the company made good on that deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">the launch of Spotify Greenroom,</a> a new mobile app and likely Clubhouse rival, that allows Spotify users worldwide to join or host live audio rooms, and optionally turn those conversations into podcasts.</p>
<p>The Spotify Greenroom app itself is based on Locker Room’s existing code, with the earlier Locker Room app basically updating to become Greenroom. To join the new app, Spotify users sign in with their current Spotify account information. They&#8217;re then walked through an onboarding experience designed to connect them with their interests. Spotify considers the app a soft launch, as it has plans to announce shows later this summer. It&#8217;s also funding shows through a new Creator Fund, whose details have not yet been revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Longer-term, the company believes it will be able to take advantage of its personalization tech to make smart recommendations about live shows, based on what music or podcasts a user listens to, and could notify users when favorite creators go live.</p>
<p>The bigger advantage Spotify has here is that its Greenroom sessions are recorded. After a show wraps, the creator can request an audio file which they can then turn into a podcast episode. This ability to straddle both worlds of live and recorded audio could prove to be more useful as the post-COVID world opens up, and users are no longer stuck at home, bored, able to tune in at any time to audio programs.</p>

<h3>Amazon lowers its cut of app developer revenues</h3>
<p>Amazon this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/amazons-appstore-lowers-its-cut-of-developer-revenue-for-small-businesses-adds-aws-credits/">quietly announced</a> it would follow in the footsteps of app store giants Apple and Google with its introduction of the Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program. The new program will reduce the commissions Amazon takes on app developer revenues for qualifying smaller businesses. Previously, Amazon’s Appstore took a 30% cut of revenue, including that from in-app purchases. Now, it will take only 20% from developers who earned up to $1 million in the prior calendar year. The company also said developers with less than $1 million in Appstore revenue in a calendar year will receive 10% of their revenue as promotional credit for AWS services, bringing the total program benefits up to an equivalent of 90% of revenue.</p>
<p>The program’s overall structure is similar to Apple’s App Store Small Business Program, announced in late 2020, which reduced Apple’s cut to 15% for developers who earn up to a $1 million threshold, after which they’re moved to the higher 30% standard rate. This rate then continues as they enter the following year. Google, more recently, took a slightly different course, by lowering the commissions to 15% on the first $1 million of developer revenue earned through the Play billing system each year.</p>
<p>The lack of attention to Amazon&#8217;s announcement, both in the developer community and by press, demonstrates how inconsequential Amazon&#8217;s own Appstore has become in the greater app ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-find-my-device-network/">teardown of the newly released Google Play Services app</a> (v.21.24.13) suggests Google is working on a &#8220;Find My Device&#8221; network</strong> that would allow Android users to locate your phone and other devices, similar to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My.&#8221;</p>

The company had not been able to ship Google apps, including the Play store, on its phones due to parent company Huawei&#8217;s placement on the U.S.&#8217;s entity list, which forced Google to pull its license. But Huawei sold off Honor last year, allowing it to work with Google again.</p>
<p><strong>Google<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/sophisticated-search-with-appsearch-in-jetpack.html"> introduced AppSearch in Jetpack</a></strong>, which is now available in Alpha. AppSearch is an on-device search library that provides high-performance and feature-rich full-text search functionality, said Google, and lives completely on-device, allowing for offline search.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p><strong>After lawsuits, injuries and deaths, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/following-lawsuits-snapchat-takes-down-controversial-speed-filter/">Snapchat finally removed its controversial &#8220;speed filter&#8221;</a></strong> which displays how fast a user was going at the time of posting. Critics argued the sticker encouraged reckless driving, as teens would try to post themselves traveling at excess speeds.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Podcasts Subscriptions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">went live across more than 170 countries</a> and regions this week</strong>. First unveiled this spring, subscriptions allow listeners to unlock additional benefits for their favorite podcasts, including things like ad-free listening, early access to new episodes, bonus material, exclusives or whatever else the podcast creator believes will be something their fans will pay for.</p>

It&#8217;s pretty incredible that Zuckerberg only months ago was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2">appearing</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-on-clubhouse/">on Clubhouse</a> to talk about the future of audio-based networking before essentially cloning the Clubhouse experience for Facebook&#8217;s own platform.</p>

The app, Zoshy+, seems to have circumvented App Review by taking advantage of server-side controls.</p>
<p><strong>In a change that represents a significant shift underway in the creators economy, TikTok <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/tiktok-vidcon-sponsor-youtube-1234996376/">signed on as creator conference VidCon&#8217;s title sponsor</a> for 2021</strong>, taking the spot formerly held by YouTube. The latter will still be involved as a secondary sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Apple-owned music identification and discovery app Shazam announced this week it had surpassed 1 billion Shazams per month.</strong> The company noted it took 10 years for Shazam to reach its first billion tags. Less than 10 years after that, Shazam has crossed 1 billion monthly recognitions and has successfully matched over 50 billion tags with over 51 million songs. At WWDC, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-new-shazamkit-brings-audio-recognition-to-apps-including-those-on-android/">announced</a> its plans for Shazam&#8217;s future with the launch of ShazamKit, which brings Shazam&#8217;s audio identification capabilities to third-party apps.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p><strong>Popular mobile game PUBG Mobile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/battlegrounds-mobile-pubg-returns-to-india/">returned to India</a> after being banned more than nine months ago.</strong> The game was banned as part of the country&#8217;s decision to boot out over 200 apps with links to China due to national security concerns. The new game has been rebranded to Battlegrounds Mobile India, but is largely the same same as before, but &#8220;with data compliance, green blood, and a constant reminder that you’re in a ‘virtual world’ with such messaging present as you start a game and when you’re in menus,&#8221; said IGN India editor Rishi Alwani.</p>

<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p><strong>An email that surfaced during the Epic trial discussed the issue of Apple&#8217;s Files app ranking first when users searched for a competitor&#8217;s app, Dropbox, for 11 months</strong>. The app had been manually boosted, the emails seemed to reveal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528701/apple-rank-own-app-over-competitor-files-dropbox-wwdc-2017?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">But Apple this week stated</a> the issue was due to the Files app having a Dropbox integration. Apple put Dropbox in the metadata, causing it to rank higher &#8212; an explanation that doesn&#8217;t match up with the internal emails.</p>
<h3>Home Automation</h3>
<p><strong>Third-party Alexa devices can now <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2021/06/17/third-party-alexa-devices-can-now-use-the-alexa-app-for-setup/">incorporate setup for their products</a> in the Alexa app</strong>, thanks to an update to Alexa Voice Services.</p>
<p><strong>Although Samsung&#8217;s SmartThings is no longer making its own smart home hardware, the company <a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/features/what-is-new-samsung-smart-things-app-2657">this week launched a new SmartThings mobile app</a> on Android</strong>, which aims to make it simpler to get to actions and automations. The app includes a new Favorites section to replace the existing home screen, a Life section where users can explore new SmartThings services, plus pages for Devices, Automations and a Menu. The iPhone version will arrive soon.</p>
<p><strong>An update to the Wyze mobile app <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/wyze-app-gets-support-google-home-assistant-support-for-lock-20210618/">added support for</a> Google Home and Google Assistant,</strong> allowing users to control smart home devices with voice commands.</p>
<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<p><strong>A report published this week by U.S. advocacy group Fight for the Future and China-based GreatFire <a href="https://www.protocol.com/china/china-app-store-lgbtq-censorship">highlighted</a> government censorship of LGBTQ+ apps around the world</strong>, due to government restrictions. It documented 1,377 cases of app access restrictions across 152 App Stores. <strong>However, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/15/app-store-lgbtq-censorship-countries-app-store/">the study contained several inaccuracies</a></strong>, Apple pointed out. For example, Grindr and Scruff are both available worldwide in the App Store, despite what the report said. Also, none of the 27 apps mentioned in the report with regard to China had been removed by Apple. Of the total 64 apps monitored, only four had been removed by a particular country because of legal issues.</p>
<h2>Security &amp; Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>A security bug in Google&#8217;s Android app, installed over 5 billion times, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/a-security-bug-in-googles-android-app-installed-on-billions-of-devices-put-user-data-at-risk/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">could have allowed</a> attackers to steal personal data</strong> from a user&#8217;s device.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eindhoven might not immediately spring to mind as a high-tech hub, but the Netherlands city is keen to position itself as a center for deep tech in Europe.</p>
<p>The Technical University of Eindhoven, High Tech Campus Eindhoven, and locally based corporates like ASML and Philips have been eyeing initiatives across Europe and applying what they’ve learned to the region’s strategy. Philips launched in Eindhoven in 1891 and played no small part in the municipality’s ambitions to become a tech hub.</p>
<p>Eindhoven produces a high number of patents per year considering its small population and has been home to an inordinate number of hardware startups. The local High Tech Campus has a high hardware focus, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey respondents consider the city strong in areas like photonics, robotics, medical devices, materials science, deep tech, automotive tech, sustainability tech, medtech, Big Data, hardware and precision engineering. They are looking for more mature startups and scaleups focused on AI and hard tech.</p>
<p>Eindhoven is considered weaker in fintech and consumer products, and it exists in a small region with limited global visibility.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, one respondent said, “Eindhoven will have evolved to the Netherlands’ second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam. On a European scale, Eindhoven will have entered the top 10.”</p>
<p>To learn more about Eindhoven, we queried the following investors:</p>

<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong></p>
<p>There is a relatively low number of investors in early stage.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?</strong></p>
<p>They will stay. Eindhoven is a hot spot with many cultures, international tech community and great infrastructure, while it feels like a village.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>Nard Sintenie, startup founders, HighTechXL.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years’ time?</strong></p>
<p>Worldwide dominance in high-tech hardware scaleups.</p>
<h2>Daniel den Boer, CEO and co-founder, Vaulut</h2>
<p><strong>What industry sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What is it weak in?</strong></p>
<p>The Eindhoven ecosystem is really strong in the sectors of mobility, smart city and energy. I&#8217;m most excited about smart city. This is our focus sector and it is the embodiment of ecosystem collaboration with impact solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in your city?</strong></p>
<p>Vaulut, Roseman Labs, FruitPunch AI, Amber, Sendcloud, Lightyear.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like? What is the investment scene like in your city? What’s their focus?</strong></p>
<p>The investment scene is getting better. They are increasingly realizing that deep tech takes time and needs to be nurtured, but the potential impact is massive and can have a dramatic effect on the entire ecosystem. There are still relatively few early-stage impact drive investors. LUMO Labs is leading the pack on that front.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic, will people stay in your city, move out or will others move in?</strong></p>
<p>I think more people will stay as the need to move to Amsterdam as the tech hub of the Netherlands diminishes, giving Eindhoven a boost to strengthen its own ecosystem, which will in turn make even more people stay and attract people to move in the city. As a result, COVID-19 will have a positive effect on Eindhoven&#8217;s tech ecosystem, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in your city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>LUMO Labs, the Eindhoven University of Technology, High Tech Campus, Amber, Brainport Eindhoven.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see your city’s tech scene in five years’ time?</strong></p>
<p>In five years, I believe Eindhoven will have evolved to Netherlands’ second-largest tech ecosystem, behind Amsterdam. On a European scale, Eindhoven will have entered the top 10.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome back to the Daily Crunch for Friday, June 18. Congratulations! You’ve made it to the end of the week without <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alexander</a>, who will return bright-eyed on Monday.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has the day off for <a href="https://juneteenth.com/">Juneteenth</a>, so this will be a tad pared down. And by “a tad pared down” I mean a lot pared down.</p>
<p>To start off, how about you have a listen to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/fintech-2021-paycheck/">latest episode of our award-winning podcast, Equity</a>. Natasha and Danny managed to fill the half hour even sans Alex, so check it out.</p>

<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<p>Speaking of podcasts, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Spotify announced it acquired Podz</a></strong>, a podcast discovery app. With more and more podcasts popping up in various categories, it’s getting harder and harder to settle on ones you love, let alone find them.

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>The London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research organized a couple of panel discussions to examine the need for markets-focused competition watchdogs and consumer-centric privacy regulators to think outside their respective “legal silos” and find creative ways to work together to tackle the challenge of Big Tech market power. <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">Read analysis by Natasha Lomas about the conversations</a></strong>, which brought together key regulatory leaders from Europe and the U.S. She says the discussions provided a glimpse into what the future shape of digital markets oversight might look like at a time when fresh blood has just been <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">injected to chair the FTC</a></strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/"><strong>StockX</strong></a></h3>
<p>StockX sits at the nexus of two radical transitions that isn’t just redefining markets, but our culture as well.

<p>Klaviyo helps marketers personalize and automate their email messaging to customers.

<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/"><strong>Duolingo</strong></a></h3>
<p>Duolingo is a language-learning app that is used by 500 million people across the world to learn Spanish, English, French and more, all while generating bookings of $190 million in 2020.

<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/"><strong>Nubank</strong></a></h3>
<p>Brazil’s banking system is a massive market, and one ill-served by incumbents. If someone could thread the needle of product development, strategy and political horse trading required to build a bank in a country where it is nearly impossible for foreigners to own or invest in a bank, it would be one of the great startup and economic success stories of this century. Nubank is on its way to realizing that objective. <em>(Written by </em><a href="https://twitter.com/marcemccarthy"><em>Marcella McCarthy</em></a><em>)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the right message, even a small startup can connect with established and emerging stars on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube who will promote your products and services — as long as your marketing team understands the influencer marketplace.</p>
<p>Creators have a wide variety of brands and revenue channels to choose from, but marketers who understand how to court these influencers can make inroads no matter the size of their budget. Although brand partnerships are still the top source of revenue for creators, many are starting to diversify.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in charge of marketing at an early-stage startup, this post explains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/">how to connect with an influencer who authentically resonates with your brand</a> and covers the basics of setting up a revenue-share structure that works for everyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The pandemic forced a reckoning about the way we work &#8212; and whether we want to keep working in the same way, with the same people, for the same company &#8212; and many are looking for something different on the other side.</p>
<p>Art Zeile, the CEO of DHI Group, notes this means it&#8217;s a great time for startups to recruit talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;While all startups are certainly not focused on being disruptive, they often rely on cutting-edge technology and processes to give their customers something truly new,&#8221; Zeile writes. &#8220;Many are trying to change the pattern in their particular industry. So, by definition, they generally have a really interesting mission or purpose that may be more appealing to tech professionals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are four considerations for high-growth company founders building their post-pandemic team.</p>

<h2>Refraction AI’s Matthew Johnson-Roberson on finding the middle path to robotic delivery</h2>

<p>&#8220;Refraction AI calls itself the Goldilocks of robotic delivery,&#8221; Rebecca Bellan writes. &#8220;The Ann Arbor-based company &#8230; was founded by two University of Michigan professors who think delivery via full-size autonomous vehicles (AV) is not nearly as close as many promise, and sidewalk delivery comes with too many hassles and not enough payoff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their &#8216;just right&#8217; solution? Find a middle path, or rather, a bike path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebecca sat down with the company&#8217;s CEO to discuss his motivation to make &#8220;something that is useful to the general public.&#8221;</p>

<p>What are investors looking for?</p>
<p>Founders often tie themselves in knots as they try to project qualities they hope investors are seeking. In reality, few entrepreneurs have the acting skills required to convince someone that they’re patient, dedicated or hard working.</p>
<p>Johan Brenner, general partner at Creandum, was an early backer of Klarna, Spotify and several other European startups. Over the last two decades, he’s identified five key traits shared by people who create billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p>“A true unicorn founder doesn’t need to have all of those capabilities on day one,” Brenner, writes “but they should already be thinking big while executing small and demonstrating that they understand how to scale a company.”</p>

<p>Scale co-founder and CEO Alex Wang joined us at TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2021 to discuss his company’s role in the autonomous driving industry and how it’s changed in the five years since its founding.</p>
<p>Scale helps large and small AV players establish reliable “ground truth” through data annotation and management, and along the way, the standards for what that means have shifted as the industry matures.</p>
<p>Even if two algorithms in autonomous driving might be created more or less equal, their real-world performance could vary dramatically based on what they’re consuming in terms of input data. That’s where Scale’s value prop to the industry starts, and Wang explains why.</p>

<p>The prevailing post-pandemic <span class="il">edtech</span> narrative, which predicted higher ed would be DOA as soon as everyone got their vaccine and took off for a gap year, might not be quite true.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas explores a new crop of <span class="il">edtech</span> SaaS startups that function like guidance counselors, helping students with everything from study-abroad opportunities to swiping right on a captivating college (really!).</p>
<p>“Startups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases,” she writes.</p>

<p>Automakers’ interest in robotics is not a new phenomenon, of course: Robots and automation have long played a role in manufacturing and are both clearly central to their push into AVs.</p>
<p>But recently, many companies are going even deeper into the field, with plans to be involved in the wide spectrum of categories that robotics touch.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, we spoke to a trio of experts at three major automakers about their companies’ unique approaches to robotics.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s location devices — called AirTags — have been out for more than a month now. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/">initial impressions </a>were good, but as we concluded back in April: “It will be interesting to see these play out once AirTags are out getting lost in the wild.”</p>
<p>That’s exactly what our resident UX analyst, <a href="http://builtformars.com/">Peter Ramsey</a>, has been doing for the last month — intentionally losing AirTags to test their user experience at the limits.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is no longer in the early-adopter phase.</p>
<p>Though it requires buy-in from across the organization, contributor Kevin Buckley writes, it&#8217;s time to gather everyone around and get to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Automating just basic workflow processes has resulted in such tremendous efficiency improvements and cost savings that businesses are adapting automation at scale and across the enterprise,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Long story short: &#8220;Adapting business automation for the enterprise should be approached as a business solution that happens to require some technical support.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mobility should be a right, but too often it’s a privilege. Can startups provide the technology and the systems necessary to help correct this injustice?</p>
<p>At  our TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event, we sat down with Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler to discuss how mobility companies should think about equity, why incorporating it from the get-go will save money in the long run, and how they can partner with cities to expand accessible and sustainable mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The need for markets-focused competition watchdogs and consumer-centric privacy regulators to think outside their respective &#8216;legal silos&#8217; and find creative ways to work together to tackle the challenge of big tech market power was the impetus for a couple of fascinating panel discussions organized by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), which were livestreamed yesterday but are available to view on-demand <a href="https://www.digitalevents.uk/cepr_privacy_and_antitrust_17june/OD?i=dQkJt4bXLfROBcRTUflqZLpZWIveF8yX">here</a>.</p>
<p>The conversations brought together key regulatory leaders from Europe and the US &#8212; giving a glimpse of what the future shape of digital markets oversight might look like at a time when fresh blood has just been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">injected to chair the FTC</a> so regulatory change is very much in the air (at least around tech antitrust).</p>
<p>CEPR&#8217;s discussion premise is that integration, not merely intersection, of competition and privacy/data protection law is needed to get a proper handle on platform giants that have, in many cases, leveraged their market power to force consumers to accept an abusive &#8216;fee&#8217; of ongoing surveillance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That fee both strips consumers of their privacy and helps tech giants perpetuate market dominance by locking out interesting new competition (which can&#8217;t get the same access to people&#8217;s data so operates at a baked in disadvantage).</p>

<p>A running theme in Europe for a number of years now, since a 2018 flagship update to the bloc&#8217;s data protection framework (GDPR), has been the ongoing under-enforcement around the EU&#8217;s &#8216;on-paper&#8217; privacy rights &#8212; which, in certain markets, means regional competition authorities are now actively grappling with exactly how and where the issue of &#8216;data abuse&#8217; fits into their antitrust legal frameworks.</p>
<p>The regulators assembled for CEPR&#8217;s discussion included, from the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority&#8217;s CEO Andrea Coscelli and the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham; from Germany, the FCO&#8217;s Andreas Mundt; from France, Henri Piffaut, VP of the French competition authority; and from the EU, the European Data Protection Supervisor himself, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, who advises the EU&#8217;s executive body on data protection legislation (and is the watchdog for EU institutions&#8217; own data use).</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s CMA now sits outside the EU, of course &#8212; giving the national authority a higher profile role in global mergers &amp; acquisition decisions (vs pre-brexit), and the chance to help shape key standards in the digital sphere via the investigations and procedures it chooses to pursue (and it has been moving very quickly on that front).</p>
<p>The CMA has a number of major antitrust probes open into tech giants &#8212; including looking into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">complaints against Apple&#8217;s App Store</a> and others <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">targeting Google&#8217;s plan to depreciate support for third party tracking cookies</a> (aka the so-called &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;) &#8212; the latter being an investigation where the CMA has actively engaged the UK&#8217;s privacy watchdog (the ICO) to work with it.</p>
<p>Only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">last week</a> the competition watchdog said it was minded to accept a set of legally binding commitments that Google has offered which could see a quasi &#8216;co-design&#8217; process taking place, between the CMA, the ICO and Google, over the shape of the key technology infrastructure that ultimately replaces tracking cookies. So a pretty major development.</p>

<p>Germany&#8217;s FCO has also been very active against big tech this year &#8212; making full use of an update to the national competition law which gives it the power to take proactive inventions around large digital platforms with major competitive significance &#8212; with open procedures now against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Bundeskartellamt</em> was already a pioneer in pushing to loop EU data protection rules into competition enforcement in digital markets in a strategic case against Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/09/is-europe-closing-in-on-an-antitrust-fix-for-surveillance-technologists/">as we&#8217;ve reported before</a>. That closely watched (and long running) case &#8212; which targets Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; of users, based on its ability to combine user data from multiple sources to flesh out a single high dimension per-user profile &#8212; is now headed to Europe&#8217;s top court (so likely has more years to run).</p>
<p>But during yesterday&#8217;s discussion Mundt confirmed that the FCO&#8217;s experience litigating that case helped shape key amendments to the national law that&#8217;s given him beefier powers to tackle big tech. (And he suggested it&#8217;ll be a lot easier to regulate tech giants going forward, using these new national powers.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we have designated a company to be of &#8216;paramount significance&#8217; we can prohibit certain conduct much more easily than we could in the past,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can prohibit, for example, that a company impedes other undertaking by data processing that is relevant for competition. We can prohibit that a use of service depends on the agreement to data collection with no choice &#8212; this is the Facebook case, indeed&#8230; When this law was negotiated in parliament parliament very much referred to the Facebook case and in a certain sense this entwinement of competition law and data protection law is written in a theory of harm in the German competition law.</p>
<p>&#8220;This makes a lot of sense. If we talk about dominance and if we assess that this dominance has come into place because of data collection and data possession and data processing you need a parameter in how far a company is allowed to gather the data to process it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The past is also the future because this Facebook case&#8230; has always been a big case. And now it is up to the European Court of Justice to say something on that,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If everything works well we might get a very clear ruling saying&#8230; as far as the ECN [European Competition Network] is concerned how far we can integrate GDPR in assessing competition matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Facebook has always been a big case &#8212; it might get even bigger in a certain sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>France&#8217;s competition authority and its national privacy regulator (the CNIL), meanwhile, have also been joint working in recent years.</p>
<p>Including over a competition complaint against Apple&#8217;s pro-user privacy App Tracking Transparency feature (which last month the antitrust watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">declined to block</a>) &#8212; so there&#8217;s evidence there too of respective oversight bodies seeking to bridge legal silos in order to crack the code of how to effectively regulate tech giants whose market power, panellists agreed, is predicated on earlier failures of competition law enforcement that allowed tech platforms to buy up rivals and sew up access to user data, entrenching advantage at the expense of user privacy and locking out the possibility of future competitive challenge.</p>
<p>The contention is that monopoly power predicated upon data access also locks consumers into an abusive relationship with platform giants which can then, in the case of ad giants like Google and Facebook, extract huge costs (paid not in monetary fees but in user privacy) for continued access to services that have also become digital staples &#8212; amping up the &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; characteristic seen in digital markets (which is obviously bad for competition too).</p>
<p>Yet, traditionally at least, Europe&#8217;s competition authorities and data protection regulators have been focused on separate workstreams.</p>
<p>The consensus from the CEPR panels was very much that that is both changing and <em>must change</em> if civil society is to get a grip on digital markets &#8212; and wrest control back from tech giants to that ensure consumers and competitors aren&#8217;t both left trampled into the dust by data-mining giants.</p>
<p>Denham said her motivation to dial up collaboration with other digital regulators was the UK government entertaining the idea of creating a one-stop-shop &#8216;Internet&#8217; super regulator. &#8220;What scared the hell out of me was the policymakers the legislators floating the idea of one regulator for the Internet. I mean what does that mean?&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I think what the regulators did is we got to work, we got busy, we become creative, got our of our silos to try to tackle these companies &#8212; the likes of which we have never seen before.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I really think what we have done in the UK &#8212; and I&#8217;m excited if others think it will work in their jurisdictions &#8212; but I think that what really pushed us is that we needed to show policymakers and the public that we had our act together. I think consumers and citizens don&#8217;t really care if the solution they&#8217;re looking for comes from the CMA, the ICO, Ofcom&#8230; they just want somebody to have their back when it comes to protection of privacy and protection of markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to use our regulatory levers in the most creative way possible to make the digital markets work and protect fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the earlier panel, the CMA&#8217;s Simeon Thornton, a director at the authority, made some interesting remarks vis-a-vis its (ongoing) Google &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; investigation &#8212; and the joint working it&#8217;s doing with the ICO on that case &#8212; asserting that &#8220;data protection and respecting users&#8217; rights to privacy are very much at the heart of the commitments upon which we are currently consulting&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we accept the commitments Google will be required to develop the proposals according to a number of criteria including impacts on privacy outcomes and compliance with data protection principles, and impacts on user experience and user control over the use of their personal data &#8212; alongside the overriding objective of the commitments which is to address our competition concerns,&#8221; he went on, adding: &#8220;We have worked closely with the ICO in seeking to understand the proposals and if we do accept the commitments then we will continue to work closely with the ICO in influencing the future development of those proposals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we accept the commitments that&#8217;s not the end of the CMA&#8217;s work &#8212; on the contrary that&#8217;s when, in many respects, the real work begins. Under the commitments the CMA will be closely involved in the development, implementation and monitoring of the proposals, including through the design of trials for example. It&#8217;s a substantial investment from the CMA and we will be dedicating the right people &#8212; including data scientists, for example, to the job,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The commitments ensure that Google addresses any concerns that the CMA has. And if outstanding concerns cannot be resolved with Google they explicitly provide for the CMA to reopen the case and &#8212; if necessary &#8212; impose any interim measures necessary to avoid harm to competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s no doubt this is a big undertaking. And it&#8217;s going to be challenging for the CMA, I&#8217;m sure of that. But personally I think this is the sort of approach that is required if we are really to tackle the sort of concerns we&#8217;re seeing in digital markets today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thornton also said: &#8220;I think as regulators we do need to step up. We need to get involved before the harm materializes &#8212; rather than waiting after the event to stop it from materializing, rather than waiting until that harm is irrevocable&#8230; I think it&#8217;s a big move and it&#8217;s a challenging one but personally I think it&#8217;s a sign of the future direction of travel in a number of these sorts of cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also speaking during the regulatory panel session was FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter &#8212; a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1536918/182_3109_slaughter_statement_on_facebook_7-24-19.pdf">dissenter</a> on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/">$5BN fine it hit Facebook with back in 2019</a> for violating an earlier consent order (as she argued the settlement provided no deterrent to address underlying privacy abuse, leaving Facebook free to continue exploiting users&#8217; data) &#8212; as well as Chris D&#8217;Angelo, the chief deputy AG of the New York Attorney General, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">leading a major states antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Slaughter pointed out that the FTC already combines a consumer focus with attention on competition but said that historically there has been separation of divisions and investigations &#8212; and she agreed on the need for more joined-up working.</p>
<p>She also advocated for US regulators to get out of a pattern of ineffective enforcement in digital markets on issues like privacy and competition where companies have, historically, been given &#8212; at best &#8212; what amounts to wrist slaps that don&#8217;t address root causes of market abuse, perpetuating both consumer abuse and market failure. And be prepared to litigate more.</p>
<p>As regulators toughen up their stipulations they will need to be prepared for tech giants to push back &#8212; and therefore be prepared to sue instead of accepting a weak settlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what is most galling to me that even where we take action, in our best faith good public servants working hard to take action, we keep coming back to the same questions, again and again,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Which means that the actions we are taking isn&#8217;t working. We need different action to keep us from having the same conversation again and again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slaughter also argued that it&#8217;s important for regulators not to pile all the burden of avoiding data abuses on consumers themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to sound a note of caution around approaches that are centered around user control,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think transparency and control are important. I think it is really problematic to put the burden on consumers to work through the markets and the use of data, figure out who has their data, how it&#8217;s being used, make decisions&#8230; I think you end up with notice fatigue; I think you end up with decision fatigue; you get very abusive manipulation of dark patterns to push people into decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I really worry about a framework that is built at all around the idea of control as the central tenant or the way we solve the problem. I&#8217;ll keep coming back to the notion of what instead we need to be focusing on is where is the burden on the firms to limit their collection in the first instance, prohibit their sharing, prohibit abusive use of data and I think that that&#8217;s where we need to be focused from a policy perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there will be ongoing debates about privacy legislation in the US and while I&#8217;m actually a very strong advocate for a better federal framework with more tools that facilitate aggressive enforcement but I think if we had done it ten years ago we probably would have ended up with a notice and consent privacy law and I think that that would have not been a great outcome for consumers at the end of the day. So I think the debate and discussion has evolved in an important way. I also think we don&#8217;t have to wait for Congress to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>As regards more radical solutions to the problem of market-denting tech giants &#8212; such as breaking up sprawling and (self-servingly) interlocking services empires &#8212; the message from Europe&#8217;s most &#8216;digitally switched on&#8217; regulators seemed to be don&#8217;t look to us for that; we are going to have to stay in our lanes.</p>
<p>So tl;dr &#8212; if antitrust and privacy regulators&#8217; joint working just sums to more intelligent fiddling round the edges of digital market failure, and it&#8217;s break-ups of US tech giants that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really needed to reboot digital markets, then it&#8217;s going to be up to US agencies to wield the hammers. (Or, as Coscelli elegantly phrased it: &#8220;It&#8217;s probably more realistic for the US agencies to be in the lead in terms of structural separation if and when it&#8217;s appropriate &#8212; rather than an agency like ours [working from inside a mid-sized economy such as the UK&#8217;s].&#8221;)</p>
<p>The lack of any representative from the European Commission on the panel was an interesting omission in that regard &#8212; perhaps hinting at ongoing &#8216;structural separation&#8217; between DG Comp and DG Justice where digital policymaking streams are concerned.</p>
<p>The current competition chief, Margrethe Vestager &#8212; who also heads up digital strategy for the bloc, as an EVP &#8212; has repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">expressed reluctance to impose radical &#8216;break up&#8217; remedies</a> on tech giants. She also recently preferred to waive through another Google digital merger (its acquisition of fitness wearable Fitbit) &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">agreeing to accept a number of &#8216;concessions&#8217;</a> and ignoring major mobilization by civil society (and indeed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/google-gobbling-fitbit-is-a-major-privacy-risk-warns-eu-data-protection-advisor/">EU data protection agencies</a>) urging her to block it.</p>
<p>Yet in an earlier CEPR discussion session, another panellist &#8212; Yale University&#8217;s Dina Srinivasan &#8212; pointed to the challenges of trying to regulate the behavior of companies when there are clear conflicts of interest, unless and until you impose structural separation as she said has been necessary in other markets (like financial services).</p>
<p>&#8220;In advertising we have an electronically traded market with exchanges and we have brokers on both sides. In a competitive market &#8212; when competition was working &#8212; you saw that those brokers were acting in the best interest of buyers and sellers. And as part of carrying out that function they were sort of protecting the data that belonged to buyers and sellers in that market, and not playing with the data in other ways &#8212; not trading on it, not doing conduct similar to insider trading or even front running,&#8221; she said, giving an example of how that changed as Google gained market power.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Google acquired DoubleClick, made promises to continue operating in that manner, the promises were not binding and on the record &#8212; the enforcement agencies or the agencies that cleared the merger didn&#8217;t make Google promise that they would abide by that moving forward and so as Google gained market power in that market there&#8217;s no regulatory requirement to continue to act in the best interests of your clients, so now it becomes a market power issue, and after they gain enough market power they can flip data ownership and say &#8216;okay, you know what before you owned this data and we weren&#8217;t allowed to do anything with it but now we&#8217;re going to use that data to for example sell our own advertising on exchanges&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what we know from other markets &#8212; and from financial markets &#8212; is when you flip data ownership and you engage in conduct like that that allows the firm to now build market power in yet another market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s Coscelli picked up on Srinivasan&#8217;s point &#8212; saying it was a &#8220;powerful&#8221; one, and that the challenges of policing &#8220;very complicated&#8221; situations involving conflicts of interests is something that regulators with merger control powers should be bearing in mind as they consider whether or not to green light tech acquisitions.</p>
<p>(Just one example of a merger in the digital space that the CMA is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/uks-competition-watchdog-still-eyeing-facebooks-giphy-buy/">still scrutizing</a> is Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of animated GIF platform Giphy. And it&#8217;s interesting to speculate whether, had brexit happened a little faster, the CMA might have stepped in to block Google&#8217;s Fitibit merger where the EU wouldn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Coscelli also flagged the issue of regulatory under-enforcement in digital markets as a key one, saying: &#8220;One of the reasons we are today where we are is partially historic under-enforcement by competition authorities on merger control &#8212; and that&#8217;s a theme that is extremely interesting and relevant to us because after the exit from the EU we now have a bigger role in merger control on global mergers. So it&#8217;s very important to us that we take the right decisions going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite often we intervene in areas where there is under-enforcement by regulators in specific areas&#8230; If you think about it when you design systems where you have vertical regulators in specific sectors and horizontal regulators like us or the ICO we are more successful if the vertical regulators do their job and I&#8217;m sure they are more success if we do our job properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we systematically underestimate&#8230; the ability of companies to work through whatever behavior or commitments or arrangement are offered to us, so I think these are very important points,&#8221; he added, signalling that a higher degree of attention is likely to be applied to tech mergers in Europe as a result of the CMA stepping out from the EU&#8217;s competition regulation umbrella.</p>
<p>Also speaking during the same panel, the EDPS warned that across Europe more broadly &#8212; i.e. beyond the small but engaged gathering of regulators brought together by CEPR &#8212; data protection and competition regulators are far from where they need to be on joint working, implying that the challenge of effectively regulating big tech across the EU is still a pretty Sisyphean one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the Commission is not sitting on hands in the face of tech giant market power.</p>
<p>At the end of last year it proposed a regime of ex ante regulations for so-called &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms, under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>. But the problem of how to effectively enforce pan-EU laws &#8212; when the various agencies involved in oversight are typically decentralized across Member States &#8212; is one key complication for the bloc. (The Commission&#8217;s answer with the DMA was to suggest putting itself in charge of overseeing gatekeepers but it remains to be seen what enforcement structure EU institutions will agree on.)</p>
<p>Clearly, the need for careful and coordinated joint working across multiple agencies with different legal competencies &#8212; if, indeed, that&#8217;s really what&#8217;s needed to properly address captured digital markets vs structural separation of Google&#8217;s search and adtech, for example, and Facebook&#8217;s various social products &#8212; steps up the EU&#8217;s regulatory challenge in digital markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can say that no effective competition nor protection of the rights in the digital economy can be ensured when the different regulators do not talk to each other and understand each other,&#8221; Wiewiórowski warned. &#8220;While we are still thinking about the cooperation it looks a little bit like everybody is afraid they will have to trade a little bit of its own possibility to assess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the classical regulators isn&#8217;t it true that at some point we are reaching this border where we know how to work, we know how to behave, we need a little bit of help and a little bit of understanding of the other regulator&#8217;s work&#8230; What is interesting for me is there is &#8212; at the same time &#8212; the discussion about splitting of the task of the American regulators joining the ones on the European side. But even the statements of some of the commissioners in the European Union saying about the bigger role the Commission will play in the data protection and solving the enforcement problems of the GDPR show there is no clear understanding what are the differences between these fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Big tech&#8217;s dominance of digital markets won&#8217;t be unpicked overnight. But, on both sides of the Atlantic, there are now a bunch of theories on how to do it &#8212; and growing appetite to wade in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://mediflash.fr">Mediflash</a>, a new French startup that wants to improve temp staffing in healthcare facilities, such as nursing homes, clinics and mental health facilities. The company positions itself as an alternative to traditional temp staffing agencies. They claim to offer better terms for both caregivers and institutions.</p>
<p>“It costs a small fortune to health facilities while caregivers are paid poorly,” co-founder Léopold Treppoz told me.</p>
<p>Traditional temp staffing agencies hire caregivers and nurses on their payroll. When a facility doesn’t have enough staff, they ask their usual temp staffing agency. The agency finds someone and charges the facility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we started, we thought we would do a temp staffing agency, but more digital, more tech,” Treppoz said. But the startup realized they would face the same issues as regular temp staffing agencies.</p>
<p>Instead, they looked at other startups working on freelancer marketplaces for developers, project managers, marketing experts and more. In France, a few of them have been quite successful, such as <a href="https://www.comet.co">Comet</a>, <a href="https://www.malt.fr">Malt</a>, <a href="https://www.staffme.fr">StaffMe</a> and <a href="https://brigad.co/fr-FR/">Brigad</a> — some of them even run a vertical focused on health professionals. But Mediflash wants to focus specifically on caregivers.</p>
<p>Professionals signing up to Mediflash are freelancers. Mediflash only acts as a marketplace that connects health facilities with caregivers. The company says caregivers can expect more revenue — up to 20% — while facilities end up paying less.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not a fair comparison as temp staffing agencies hire caregivers. As a freelancer, you don’t have the same benefits as a full-time employee. And in particular, you can’t get unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>“But a lot of caregivers say that this isn’t an issue because there is a lot of demand [from health facilities],” Treppoz said. On the platform, you’ll find students in nursing school who want to earn a bit of money, professionals who already have a part-time job looking for additional work as well as full-time substitute caregivers.</p>
<p>Usually, facilities just want someone for three days because they’re running short on staff. Mediflash is well aware that health facilities usually work with one temp staffing agency and that’s it. That’s why the startup has a sales team that has to talk with each facility one by one. Right now, the startup is mostly focused on Metz, Nancy and Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Mediflash recently raised a $2 million funding round (€1.7 million) led by Firstminute Capital. Several business angels are also participating, such as Alexandre Fretti (Malt), Alexandre Lebrun (Nabla), Simon Dawlat (Batch.com) and Marie Outtier (Aiden.ai, acquired by Twitter).</p>
<p>So far, the company has managed 1,400 substitute days. Mediflash takes a cut on each transaction. The company now plans to expand to other cities all around the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian fintech startup BharatPe is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $250 million in a new financing round led by Tiger Global, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series E, is giving the three-year-old New Delhi-headquartered firm a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. The round hasn&#8217;t closed, so terms may change, sources cautioned.</p>
<p>BharatPe, which prior to the new round had raised about $233 million in equity and $35 million in debt, was valued at about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-900-million-in-new-108-million-fundraise/">$900 million in its Series D round</a> in February this year, and $425 million last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet the CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/04/cred-razorpay-bharatpe-funding/">first reported</a> about the talks between Tiger Global and BharatPe and said the round would value the startup at over $2 billion. BharatPe, which counts Coatue, Ribbit Capital, and Sequoia Capital India among its existing investors, declined to comment.</p>
<p>BharatPe operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments and secure working capital. Even as India has already emerged as the second-largest internet market, with more than 600 million users, much of the country remains offline.</p>
<p>Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The startup, which serves more than 6 million merchants, said it had deployed over 50,000 PoS machines by November of last year, and enables monthly transactions worth more than $123 million. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending. And it should now be able to achieve many of those goals more easily.</p>
<h3>Becoming a bank</h3>
<p>On Friday, India&#8217;s central bank RBI <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51752">granted</a> an in-principle licence to Centrum Financial Services, which acquired a struggling bank earlier this year, to set up a small finance bank. Centrum Financial Services has <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pmc-bid-bharatpe-offers-to-pay-100-to-retail-depositors/articleshow/80296161.cms">collaborated with BharatPe</a> for the license, and the Indian startup said in a statement that two are &#8220;equal&#8221; partners.</p>

<p>In a statement, Jaspal Bindra, Executive Chairman of Centrum Group, said the two firms will work to create a &#8220;new age bank.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The startup is additionally also working to launch two new apps, one of which is called PostPe and enables credit on QR UPI, while the other B2C app will facilitate peer-to-peer lending at up to 12% interest (without any collateral; though BharatPe will serve as an intermediator), another source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new products will launch as soon as this month, the source said.</p>
