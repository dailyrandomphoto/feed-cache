										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian rocket launch startup <a href="http://www.gspacetech.com/">Gilmour Space Technologies</a> is betting that bigger isn’t always better. The company has developed a small launch vehicle it calls Eris, a 25 meter (82 foot) rocket that can deliver payload of up to 215 kilograms (474 lbs) to sun synchronous orbit. Now, it’s raised a $61 million AUD ($46 million USD) Series C round to take Eris to space next year.</p>
<p>Eris is much smaller than other launch companies’ rockets. Relativity Space’s Terran One has a max payload capacity to LEO of around 1,250 kg (2,756 lbs); even SpaceX’s Falcon 1, its first and smallest orbital rocket, could deliver 450 kg (990 lbs). Gilmour Space is wagering that the lighter payload will result in lower costs for a burgeoning suite of customers looking to send spacecraft to orbit.</p>
<p>The funds will also go toward nearly doubling the company’s workforce, from 70 to 120 employees, and developing a new commercial spaceport at Abbot Point, Queensland. Australian legislators approved construction of the launch site in May. Gilmour Space is also examining a proposed launch site in south Australia to facilitate polar orbit launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Gilmour Space has already signed agreements with prospective customers for future Eris launches. This includes contracts with two Australian space startups: Space Machines Company, to launch a 35 kg spacecraft on Eris’ inaugural flight, and Fleet Space Technologies, to carry six nanosatellites in 2023. Gilmour Space has also signed an agreement with U.S.-based Momentus, to use its orbital transfer services.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fine Structure Ventures and included contributions from Australian VCs Blackbird and Main Sequence, and Australian pension funds HESTA, Hostplus and NGS Super. Blackbird and Main Sequence are returning investors after leading Gilmour’s Series A and Series B, respectively. This is the largest amount of private equity funding ever raised by a space company in Australia, and brings the company’s total amount raised to $87 million AUD ($66 million USD).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s almost go-time for all you early-stage startup founders. That’s right, on July 8-9 thousands of determined entrepreneurs around the world will gather virtually for the best little two-day bootcamp we like to call <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>.</p>
<p>Two days focused on the bottom-line essentials to build your start up the right way. Here we lay out five reasons why you should stop what you’re doing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">buy your pass</a> and invest in a conference designed to make your work life a whole lot easier.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1. Learn from leading startup experts</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We packed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the agenda</a> with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">incredible subject-matter experts</a> who will offer highly interactive presentations across a range of topics every startup founder needs to know. Listen, engage and learn so you can avoid painful, expensive missteps and move forward without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>“Vlad Magdalin, founder of Webflow, was very candid about the challenges he faced on his journey to success. You always hear about startups that raise millions of dollars, but you don&#8217;t necessarily hear about the ups and downs it takes to get to that point. It’s important for early founders to see that side, too.” — Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl and Early Stage 2020 attendee.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2. Implement advice right out of the gate</strong></p>
<p>Plenty of conferences are long on opinion but short on advice that you can adapt and fold into your business now — when you need it the most. You won’t find that happening at TC Early Stage. Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft, told us she came away for Early Stage 2020 with tips she could implement right away.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">3. Expand your network</strong></p>
<p>Big networks offer more opportunities. It’s just that simple. You’ll have plenty of time to expand your networking empire at Early Stage. And, as Ashley Barrington notes, you never know where a chance meeting might lead one day.</p>
<blockquote><p>“CrunchMatch made it easy to set up short networking sessions with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. I met other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4. Improve your pitch deck</strong></p>
<p>Day two features a pitch-off between 10 early-stage founders. They’ll present their pitches and receive invaluable feedback from our panel of esteemed judges. Even if you’re not on that virtual stage pitching your heart out, you’ll learn a lot by tuning in. Take it from Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly, who attended Early Stage 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pitch deck teardown session was great. VCs reviewed my deck and gave specific, actionable advice. Watching them provide comments on other decks was helpful, too. We’re incorporating the feedback and when we start fundraising, the improved slides will make it easier for VCs to understand our value proposition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">5. Connect with your community</strong></p>
<p>Every TechCrunch event, whether it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage</a>, Disrupt or TC Sessions, strives to provide a sense of community. Why? Because you may go faster alone, but you’ll go further together. Commune, commiserate and celebrate with your tribe of early-stage founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>“TechCrunch does this thing of connecting total strangers to create a genuinely supportive community. We’re all trying to do the same thing, which is bring our idea to life and make it a reality. I loved that unexpected benefit.” — Jessica McLean, director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">Buy your pass</a> and join your community at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9. We can’t wait to welcome you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, there has been a surge of newly formed digital banks aimed at specific demographics. The banks in nearly all cases are trying to meet the needs of certain populations that they believe are feeling left out or underserved by traditional financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest such neobank to emerge is New York-based </span><a href="https://joindaylight.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as the first LGBTQ+ digital banking platform in the United States. (There is a digital bank in Brazil with a similar mission called </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/brazils-pride-bank-says-its-the-first-lgbti-bank-in-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pride Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBTQ+ entrepreneurs Rob Curtis (CEO), Billie Simmons, a trans woman (COO) and Paul Barnes Hoggett (CTO), Daylight is announcing today that it has secured $5 million in a seed funding round. Kapor Capital and Precursor Capital co-led the round, which included participation from Anthemis Group, Clocktower, Financial Venture Studio and Citibank.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight says its mission is to “build a more equitable financial life for LGBTQ+ folks and their chosen families.” The company’s services are targeted toward LGBTQ+ people, their families, and allies — or as Dayilght describes it, “values-based consumers who want to support the queer community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which was founded in 2020, plans to use its new capital mostly to expand its flagship product and lifestyle services, which are designed to improve financial equality and inclusion for the estimated 30-million-plus Americans who identify as LGBTQ+. It also plans to build out a LGBTQ+ business marketplace and a platform that offers discounts and rewards when members shop at merchants whose actions support the queer community.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qQ8jkhK9nx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=qQ8jkhK9nx" data-secret="qQ8jkhK9nx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch Curtis explained why he believes Daylight is uniquely positioned to help the population deal with challenges such as higher debt accumulation to factors such as p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-existing conditions, lower insurance levels, HIV management needs and [gender] transition costs. At the same time, many members of the community also have lower income levels due to “continued workplace discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBT people engage with money really differently and there’s a multitude of reasons for that,” Curtis said. “We spend about the same proportion of our income on discretionary spend, but we&#8217;re about 20% less likely to have a savings account, 20% less likely to own investments like stocks, or a quarter less likely to own a mutual fund. And we estimate that only about 30% of our community has any estate planning in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, life in general tends to be more costly for LGBTQ+ persons, Curtis believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is expensive to be a queer person,” he said. “Not only do we find that when we come out to our parents, 40% of us no longer have financial support for things like college and those transitions from childhood into adulthood. We end up with 50% more college debt. We also have increased sexual health costs and some have gender affirming surgery that they need to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the time we get to our 30s, we will be told ‘you can have one of the following three things: gender affirming surgery, a home deposit or a child,’ ” Curtis added. And, on top of that, having a child is generally more expensive for this population because people either have to adopt or hire a surrogate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapor Capital Partner Brian Dixon believes that the fact that Daylight’s founders have personally experienced problems within the traditional banking industry gives them the necessary insight to help others in the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those problems include friction associated with names on issued cards, which leads to customers being outed as trans. The population also faces a lack of adequate financing products, Dixon believes, for things such as surrogacy, IVF, adoption, transition support and mental health.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">Maybe neobanks will break even after all</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=Mweqgd4nkI" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many neobanks do not provide a truly unique banking experience that will result in a mass exodus from traditional banks,” Dixon said. “Daylight has an opportunity to be the outlier, especially given their focus on community. Daylight’s unique features include a seamless card issuance process that allows trans and non-binary customers to order a card in their preferred name, book sessions with expert LGBTQ+ financial coaches, get peer-to-peer advice from their digital community and earn rewards that are meaningful to the LGBT+ community.”</span></p>
<p>Daylight will offer features such as a checking account, the ability for members to get paid two days early, free ATMs and &#8220;no hidden fees,&#8221; according to Curtis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that payday early is really important because we know that there are high rates of credit card declines for folks who are buying hormones,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature the Daylight platform offers is personalized recommendations to members which alert them when they’re spending money with merchants that support anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and initiatives, a practice known as “rainbow washing.” It will also offer alternative merchants that it says are “more aligned with the community’s values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBTQ+ consumers, and those that support them, are very intentional about where they spend, but it’s difficult for an individual to know whether they’re spending in line with their values, or inadvertently shopping with brands that engages in rainbow washing while funding politicians and projects that work against our interests,” Curtis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight is currently in beta but already has “thousands and thousands” of customers on its wait list, said Curtis, who estimates that it will have 10,000 customers by the time it launches in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other digital banks targeting specific demographics that have raised funding over the past year include Fair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multilingual digital bank and financial services platform that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/fair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently launched to the public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after raising $20 million in 40 days earlier this year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mandolin just marked its first birthday earlier this month, and yet the Indianapolis-based startup is already announcing a $12 million Series A. That’s a quick follow up to the $5 million seed it raised in early October of last year. Turns out the global pandemic is a pretty fortuitious time to launch and grow a concert streaming platform.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed round was co-led by 645 Ventures and Foundry Group and featured additional funding from existing investors like High Alpha and TIME Ventures (Marc Benioff).</p>
<p>The big question, of course, is what happens to a company like Mandolin when the world starts opening back up? Sure concert livestreams got a massive boost as fans and artists alike were seeking an outlet as touring ground to a halt. But what now that venues are starting to reopen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As artists return to performing in sold out venues, Live+ will undoubtedly become a can’t-live-without digital complement that amplifies live shows,” CEO Mary Kay Huse said in a release. “Our new round of financing will support us in driving innovation of our core solution, delivering new digital offerings, and reinforcing our routes to market, so that every show is Live+.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mandolin</p></div></p>
<p>Granted, that’s…pretty abstract. But the simple answer is the company has been looking toward enhancing the in-person event as well, ahead of an inevitable reopening. Essentially the company wants to build a companion app for shows.</p>
<p>Here’s what Huse told Variety last week, “I would love it if we could see upwards of 50% of in-person attendees experiencing something digitally while in the venue, as early as before the end of the year. It’s just creating a compelling content that makes them want to do it.”</p>
<p>The company will also continue to focus on streaming, which may see a hit, but certainly isn’t going away, post-pandemic. The news also sees 645 Managing Partner Nnamdi Okike joining the company’s board.</p>
<p>“During COVID-19, livestreaming has been a game-changer for fans who want to experience their favorite artists, and for artists and venues who want to bring exciting live events for their fans,” Okike said. “Mandolin provides the best technology platform to enable these experiences, and they’re also scaling a company to meet the needs of this fast-growing category.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While many Chinese companies are seemingly struggling to find the demand that they expect for their shares on American exchanges, domestic companies are seeing some opposite results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The American IPO market is hot for many companies, but surprisingly cool for others. The gap between the two cohorts of private companies looking to list is becoming notable.</p>
<p>When Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi first set an IPO price range, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/">was curious</a> about why the company felt so inexpensive. Compared to its American comps, shares in Didi simply felt underpriced at its proposed valuation interval. Recently, Didi stuck to its initial expectations by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/didi-announces-pricing-initial-public-120000514.html">pricing at $14 per share</a>, the upper end of its range, but no higher.</p>
<p>This week also brought a lackluster float for Chinese grocery-delivery company DingDong, which <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/the-ipo-buzz-dingdong-chops-ipos-size/">cut its IPO raise</a> but only managed a flat American debut. Another China-based online grocery delivery service that went public domestically last week, Missfresh, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/chinese-online-grocery-firms-dingdong-missfresh-have-a-tough-ipo.html">is doing even worse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>With just those few data points, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to be particularly bullish about U.S.-listed IPOs. Why go public in the United States if you are going to be underpriced and then trade poorly? The answer is that while many Chinese companies are seemingly struggling to find the demand that they expect for their shares on American exchanges, domestic companies are seeing some opposite results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re talking tech companies here, I should add; The Exchange doesn&#8217;t track IPO results for commodities diggers and biotech labs. It&#8217;s a big world. We have to focus.</p>
<p>There are contrary data points to our general thesis. Nio&#8217;s recent share price appreciation could be construed as such. But if we parse recent <em>IPO </em>news from SentinelOne and Xometry in contrast to what we&#8217;ve seen from Chinese tech companies&#8217; own paths to the American public markets, there really does seem to be a gap forming.</p>
<h2>Uneven ground</h2>
<p>Didi&#8217;s IPO price of $14 per share values the company at around $67 billion on a non-diluted basis, and as high as $70 billion if we counted more shares in its market cap calculations. As we previously calculated, with around $6.5 billion in total Q1 2021 revenue and positive net income, the company is trading at a stiff multiples discount to Uber.</p>
<p>Indeed, Uber&#8217;s <em>trailing</em> price/sales ratio is north of 8x. If we valued Didi&#8217;s revenues from the last twelve months at the same price, it would be worth nearly $179 billion. It&#8217;s not. And that&#8217;s the gap that we want to stress.</p>
<p>That a few other Chinese tech IPOs listed in the United States underperformed in the last week is contrasted by a blizzard of positive IPO results from domestic companies from just this week:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is building its own version of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follow with a feature that would allow online creators to publish &#8220;exclusive&#8221; content to their Instagram Stories that&#8217;s only available to their fans &#8212; access that would likely come with a subscription payment of some kind. Instagram confirmed the screenshots of the feature <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1409597323076853760">recently circulated</a> across social media are from an internal prototype that&#8217;s now in development, but not yet being publicly tested. The company declined to share any specific details about its plans, saying the company is not at a place to talk about this project just yet.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172118" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172118" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Exclusive Story in development via <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi</a></strong></p></div></p>
<p>The screenshots, however, convey a lot of about Instagram&#8217;s thinking as they show a way that creators could publish what are being called &#8220;Exclusive Stories&#8221; to their account, which are designated with a different color (<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1408017220391903234/photo/1">currently purple</a>). When other Instagram users come across the Exclusive Stories, they&#8217;ll be shown a message that says that &#8220;only members&#8221; can view this content. The Stories cannot be screenshot either, it appears, and they can be shared as Highlights. A new prompt encourages creators to &#8220;save this to a Highlight for your Fans,&#8221; explaining that, by doing so, &#8220;fans always have something to see when they join.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Exclusive Stories feature was uncovered by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features in the code of mobile apps. Over the past week, he&#8217;s published a series screenshots to an ongoing Twitter thread about his findings.</p>

<p>Exclusive Stories are only one part of Instagram&#8217;s broader plans for expanded creator monetization tools.</p>
<p>The company has been slowly revealing more details about its efforts in this space, with Instagram Head Adam Mosseri first telling <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund">The Information</a> in May that the company was &#8220;exploring&#8221; subscriptions along with other new features, like NFTs.</p>
<p>Paluzzi also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1409612389381775361">recently found references</a> to the NFT feature, Collectibles, which shows how digital collectibles could appear on a creator&#8217;s Instagram profile in a new tab.</p>

<p>Instagram, so far, hasn&#8217;t made a public announcement about these specific product developments, instead choosing to speak at a high-level about its plans around things like subscriptions and tips.</p>
<p>For example, during Instagram&#8217;s Creator Week in early June &#8212; an event that could have served as an ideal place to offer a first glimpse at some of these ideas &#8212; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CP9DDRyhJvj/">Mosseri talked</a> more generally about the sort of creator tools Instagram was interested in building, without saying which were actually in active development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to create, if we want to be the best platform for creators long term, a whole suite of things, or tools, that creators can use to help do what they do,&#8221; he said, explaining that Instagram was also working on more creative tools and safety features for creators, as well as tools that could help creators make a living.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s super important that we create a whole suite of different tools, because what you might use and what would be relevant for you as a creator might be very different than an athlete or a writer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so, largely, [the creator monetization tools] fall into three categories. One is commerce &#8212; so either we can do more to help with branded content; we can do more with affiliate marketing&#8230;we can do more with merch,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The second is ways for users to actually pay creators directly &#8212; so whether it is gated content or subscriptions or tips, like badges, or other user payment-type products. I think there&#8217;s a lot to do there. I love those because those give creators a direct relationship with their fans &#8212; which I think is probably more sustainable and more predictable over the long run,&#8221; Mosseri said.</p>
<p>The third area is focused on revenue share, as with IGTV long-form video and short-form video, like Reels, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172120" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172120" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Instagram Exclusive Story feature in development via </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Alessandro Paluzzi</strong> <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Instagram isn&#8217;t the only large social platform moving forward with creator monetization efforts.</p>
<p>The membership model, popularized by platforms like OnlyFans and Patreon, has been more recently making its way to a number of mainstream social networks as the creator economy has become better established.</p>
<p>Twitter, for example, first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">announced its own take on creator subscriptions, </a>with the unveiling of its plans for the Super Follow feature during an Analyst Day event in February. Last week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">began rolling out applications</a> for Super Follows and Ticked Spaces &#8212; the latter, a competitor to Clubhouse&#8217;s audio social networking rooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook just yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">launched</a> its Substack newsletter competitor, Bulletin, which offers a way for creators to sell premium subscriptions and access member-only groups and live audio rooms. Even Spotify has launched an audio chat room and Clubhouse rival, Greenroom, which it also plans to eventually monetize.</p>
<p>Though the new screenshots offer a deeper look into Instagram&#8217;s product plans on this front, we should caution that an in-development feature is not necessarily representative of what a feature will look like at launch or how it will ultimately behave. It&#8217;s also not a definitive promise of a public launch &#8212; though, in this case, it would be hard to see Instagram scrapping its plans for exclusive, member-only content given its broader interest in serving creators, where such a feature is essentially part of a baseline offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic achieved anything good, it was putting health front and center in the minds of the general public, elected officials, investors and innovators. Cityblock has been working on solutions for bringing together the healthcare industry and communities since long before now, but it raised a total of $372 million spanning December through March, so it&#8217;s definitely seeing the impact of the visibility of its mission in light of a worldwide healthcare crisis.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">June 30 at noon PT/3PM ET</a>, Cityblock co-founder and CEO Iyah Romm will join us for an episode of Extra Crunch Live, along with Cityblock investor and Maverick Ventures managing partner Ambar Bhattacharyya. We&#8217;ll talk about the process of fundraising for this critical area in urgent need of innovation, and what it&#8217;s like trying to manage that process when the business you&#8217;re in is experiencing one of its busiest and most fraught times ever. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">Register here for free</a>.</p>
<p>Romm and Bhattacharyya will also be providing live feedback to participants in our weekly Extra Crunch Live pitch-off, which you can apply to join live during the event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But we&#8217;ve talked about Cityblock a bit, let&#8217;s take a step back and look at our guests.</p>
<p>Iyah Romm co-founded Cityblock in 2017 and has been its chief executive ever since. Before that, he was entrepreneur in residence at Sidewalk Labs, from which Cityblock spun out. He has a long history in public health and private care, including as chief transformation officer at Commonwealth Care Alliance, and a stint at the Health Policy Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya has spent more than a decade in VC, including at Bessemer and Bain, as well as in his current role at Maverick Ventures. His track record includes investments in companies that have had a total of 11 exists via IPO and acquisition, including four public market unicorns. His specific focus has been on early and growth-stage healthcare companies, so it&#8217;s a space he knows very well.</p>
<p>Maverick participated in Cityblock&#8217;s Series A, as well as its Series B and both the C and C extension rounds from this past year.</p>
<p>The episode goes down at noon PT/3PM ET on June 30 and is free to all who want to check it out live.

		BJ Jenkins is CEO of <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/">Barracuda</a>, a provider of cloud-enabled security and data protection solutions. He is a member of the boards of directors at <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/">SumoLogic</a> and <a href="https://www.generac.com/">Generac Power Systems</a>.
	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It used to be a heavily traveled two-way street in corporate America: CEOs joined other companies’ boards to broaden their experiences, expand their influence, or simply because it felt good. Boards sought out CEOs because of the knowledge they bring and their unique ability to interact with the company CEO as an equal.</p>
<p>But the number of sitting CEOs on outside boards keeps shrinking. As the CEO role has become more difficult and demanding, greater numbers of chief executives are shying away from external board roles and many boards now limit their own CEOs’ board assignments as well.</p>
<p>The pandemic accelerated the trend, according to a <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/ceos-as-directors-maybe-not">report</a> by management consulting firm Korn Ferry, citing “evidence that the unprecedented demands posed by the pandemic led many CEO directors to resign from outside boards to focus on their own organizations.” Fewer than half of CEOs now serve on an outside board, the report said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One good thing about the drop in CEO board assignments is more opportunity for non-CEOs and other traditionally underrepresented groups to join corporate boards.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At the same time, many corporations are feeling pressure to bring more gender and racial diversity to their boards and are making membership available to a broader array of candidates than in the past.</p>
<p>Is the decrease in CEO board participation a positive or negative? Interestingly, it’s both.</p>
<p>Here are four benefits of CEOs serving on boards:</p>
<p><strong>Advising another company can make for a better CEO. </strong>CEOs who opt out of corporate board directorships out of fear of overextending themselves &#8212; and boards who restrict their own CEOs’ board assignments for the same reason &#8212; miss a key point: Time on a board usually makes them a better leader.</p>
<p>I’m on two outside boards. An inside view of another company’s challenges and opportunities, its peaks and valleys, what strategies worked and didn’t, has revealed insights I’ve ended up applying at my own company. Being on the other side of the table has even helped me better understand how to communicate with my company’s board.</p>
<p><strong>Serving on a board can prevent myopia. </strong>Because of digital disruption, businesses must move at an unprecedented pace to stay competitive. Job No. 1 for all CEOs is to act on this reality every day inside their companies. But drawing exclusively from their own company’s experience can blind a leader to broader perspectives in the outside world. A board stint is a great way to ensure they’re getting those.</p>
<p><strong>Board memberships can make CEOs more empathetic. </strong>There’s a lot of talk these days about the need for heightened empathy in the C-suite, and with good reason: The global health crisis, racial injustice and other extraordinary stressors demand that senior executives possess what McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/tuning-in-turning-outward-cultivating-compassionate-leadership-in-a-crisis">described</a> as four qualities “to manage in crisis and shepherd their organization into a post-crisis next normal” &#8212; awareness, vulnerability, empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>In these times, it’s critically important for a CEO to cultivate as wide a frame of reference as possible, and involvement with another company through a board directorship accomplishes that.</p>
<p><strong>Helping another company does broader good. </strong>If a CEO has the wherewithal beyond their own company responsibilities to bring value to another firm’s board, that’s a positive for the world at large. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.</p>
<p>For example, I’m a board member at a company that once was strictly a manufacturer of home standby generators. It’s now digital savvy, with Wi-Fi-equipped generators providing a number of services on users’ smartphones. This means they also needs a strong cybersecurity strategy, my area of expertise. I take satisfaction in believing my guidance is benefiting the company, its shareholders and its customers.</p>
<p>So what’s good about the drop in CEO board assignments? That’s easy: more opportunity for non-CEOs and other traditionally underrepresented groups, including women and people of color, to join corporate boards.</p>
<p>“In a little-noticed but remarkable shift, many firms are skipping the corner suite and looking elsewhere for directors,” Korn Ferry reported. “Recent data shows that nearly two-thirds of the more than 400 director seats filled last year were taken by someone other than a CEO. Experts say since both the pandemic and the racial-equality protests of last year, companies are determined to create boards with more diverse faces and more specific skill sets.”</p>
<p>Equilar’s most recent <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/81-q1-2021-equilar-gender-diversity-index">Gender Diversity Index</a> found that at the end of Q1 2021, 24.3% of all board seats in the Russell 3000 were occupied by women, up from 15% at the end of 2016. “The path toward equal representation of men and women in public company boardrooms seemed to go nowhere for decades, but there has been a significant clearing in recent years,” the report said. (Nevertheless, Equilar cautions that boards won’t hit gender parity until 2032.)</p>
<p>And many of these non-CEO board members are doing an excellent job. According to a <a href="https://boardspan.com/users/0/library/do-ceos-make-the-best-board-members">survey</a> by Stanford University’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance, 79% of board members feel that, in practice, active CEOs are no better than non-CEO board members. A CEO may bring cachet to the board, but many non-CEOs contribute real work as a director, the study said.</p>
<p>Increased diversity on boards isn’t just an excellent development by itself; board experience positions members well for future leadership roles and thus can act as a proxy to get more women and people of color into corner offices.</p>
<p>Making board membership accessible to a wider range of candidates beyond typically white male CEOs &#8212; they still <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/specials/fortune-500-ceos-2000-2020-still-male-still-white/">account</a> for almost 90% of Fortune 500 CEOs &#8212; offers hope that diversity in the business leader ranks will keep rising.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think this potential outweighs the negatives of more CEOs staying out of outside companies’ board rooms.</p>

The investor was recused from the board because they did not notify Perez of a new investment that the founder sees as competitive with Hinge &#8212; New York-based <a href="https://www.clearing.com/">Clearing</a>.</p>
<p>The scenario alarmed Perez, who has requested that the investor go unnamed, given the confidential information to which his board of directors is privy.</p>
<p>“You don’t develop a great reputation with entrepreneurs if you invest in competitive situations, particularly without giving them a heads up.&#8221; Adds Perez, &#8220;Some investors have a strong moral compass, some do not.&#8221; The partner that left Hinge Health&#8217;s board has not taken a board seat at Clearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesperson from Bessemer declined to comment on the event because the firm does not “publicly discuss the mechanics of private Board dynamics.”</p>
<p>There hasn&#8217;t been a complete break between Bessemer and Hinge Health, a now six-year-old company that was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">$3 billion </a>during its last round of funding in January. Initially describing the situation as a firing, Perez said that the company &#8220;separated ways&#8221; with the original partner. In lieu of that, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheValuesVC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Elliott Robinson,</a> a growth equity partner with Bessemer, was upgraded from board observer to the newest board director at Hinge Health. The switch enables Bessemer to maintain visibility into its investment, while at the same time, letting Hinge Health make a statement to the firm and future investors about how it views transparency.</p>
<p>The tiff points to the increasingly nuanced tension around competition between startups, as deal velocity and volume reach all-time highs. While founders expect certain standards of conduct from investors, including that they notify them of investments in directly competitive startups, investors<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> may be feeling more pressure to make faster decisions that clash with the founders they&#8217;ve already backed, while having different definitions of competition from their portfolios.</span></p>
<h2>Defining competition</h2>
<p>Hinge Health is a digital health startup in the musculoskeletal (MSK) space that sells its care to insurers, self-insured employers and health plans. Clearing, meanwhile, brands itself as a solution to chronic pain, which is a symptom of underlying MSK conditions. The latter is going direct-to-consumer with its service, ignoring insurance carriers altogether. The venn diagram of the two companies thus overlaps vaguely, but looks different both from a product and go to market strategy.</p>
<p>Certainly, <a href="https://www.clearing.com/">Clearing</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-dorfman-3a89803">Avi Dorfman</a>, previously the co-founder of Compass, does not consider the two direct competitors. Asked by TechCrunch about potential overlap for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">recent piece on personalized healthcare</a> in TechCrunch, Dorfman pointed to Bessemer&#8217;s stake in both companies as evidence that the two are taking very different tacks and targeting different end customers.</p>
<p>Of course, early-stage companies can evolve quickly, and even if the two aren&#8217;t competing squarely today, Hinge and Clearing have enough in common &#8212; Clearing is &#8220;competitively spirited,&#8221; says Perez &#8212; that Perez was surprised that Bessemer wouldn&#8217;t at least broach the conversation about Clearing with him.</p>
<p>“I think the best practice is that the investor asks the existing company how they feel about the conflict, and if they think it&#8217;ll be competitive,” says Perez via email. “Baseline, you always have to have a conversation. I&#8217;ve had 3-4 of those conversations with investors, and we understand the parameters, is there meaningful conflict, and how to ensure confidential information isn&#8217;t shared.”</p>
<p>No doubt plenty of founders might agree. To protect themselves, venture firms never include language in the term sheets that promises they&#8217;ll never invest in competing companies, but there has traditionally been a tacit understanding between founders and the investors who back them that the investor will avoid backing a similar company at all costs.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz somewhat famously missed out on owning more of Instagram after also investing in a company that later veered into Instagram&#8217;s business and deciding that it needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/andreessen-horowitz-isnt-hedging-its-bets-with-picplz-and-instagram-it-has-picked-picplz/">pick one or the other</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca">Marc Andreessen</a> told TechCrunch at the time, in 2010: “This kind of stuff happens all the time. Entrepreneurs are like heat-seeking-missiles; they gravitate towards good opportunities . . . It’s less of a choice against Kevin [Systrom] and Instagram as it was we were just very excited about working with Dalton [Caldwell],” who co-founded the now-defunct Instagram rival and is today a partner with Y Combinator.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">Sequoia gave away its $21 million stake</a> in a payments company, Finix, after resolving that its early-stage investment in the company competed too directly with Stripe, among its most valuable portfolio companies.</p>
<p>As more and more deals get funded and faster, the possibility for competitive overlap is growing &#8211; along with the scenarios that can be considered conflicting in the first place. What happens when a startup pivots into a different market than the one that it sold its investors on, and is suddenly competitive with a portfolio company? Can a Sequoia India partner back a company that is directly competing with a Sequoia India company? Is it okay for there to be competing investments within the same firm as long as different partners are sitting on the board? While founders may deserve transparency, there has to be some sort of reasonable boundaries on what they consider competitive, as well as an understanding that not all firms make promises to avoid conflicts.</p>
<h2><strong>Legitimizing unspoken rules</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrupUxGP11SDPTpAIPJScaM4aUjkaFUxQPRtOZv5OX0/edit">Tania Shah,</a> a startup lawyer and the founder of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/04/13/startup-brings-legal-services-to-entrepreneurs.html#:~:text=In%20The%20Know%20Legal%20is,proxy%20appointments%2C%20and%20simple%20wills.">The Know Legal</a>, often works with founders who are raising seed rounds and has to educate them on the “unspoken rule” of obligations around confidentiality and loyalty. Essentially, she explains the obligations of a passive investor versus a board member who has more access to confidential information along with voting power. Part of what she teaches is that VCs tend not to sign NDAs &#8212; even while she pushes her clients to ask for these &#8212; so founders need to be as certain as possible that they are taking money from the right sources.</p>
<p>“I think the role of attorneys right now is also to be teachers,” says Shah.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is no shortage of horror stories. Nabeel Alamgir, CEO and founder of Lunchbox, for example, struggled to raise his first institutional check for his restaurant tech startup. He eventually found an investor who had connections to restaurants in New York City who Alamgir wanted to land, so Alamgir shared everything about Lunchbox, from its financials to its product integration road map and go-to-market strategy. The investor eventually ghosted Alamgir. Within four months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/in-a-post-nda-world-does-transparency-help-founders-identify-conflicts-of-interest/ ">claims Alamgir,</a> that same investor’s portfolio company launched a product that directly mimicked Lunchbox.</p>
<p>In February,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/this-insurtech-alleges-a-venture-backer-founded-and-funded-a-copycat-a-founders-nightmare/"> a similar situation appeared to play out</a> when insurtech company Sure claimed that venture firm IA Capital Group, its Series A investor, had used privileged information to launch a similar company called Boost. (IA Capital told TC at the time that the firm didn’t realize there was a potential conflict until Boost was “already well underway.” Sure has since filed a <a href="https://www.axios.com/sure-inc-boost-insurance-venture-capital-lawsuit-4ac03bfa-300d-4bef-b126-6449f050bbd4.html">related lawsuit</a> against Boost.)</p>

<p>Hinge Health’s Perez say that this conversation around competing interests and conflict has grown in the past year in his conversations with investors. After all, VCs have  ballooning funds to invest and  LP expectations to meet &#8211; and it may become impractical at some point for these same investors to fully back away from compelling bets in booming industries.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone through a bunch of business cycles, and so I’m seeing this business cycle where there’s a lot of deal flow,” Perez said. In his case, “We’re not going to carve out a whole field of medicine and say that you can&#8217;t play at all in this field,&#8221; But at minimum, he says, VCs and their founders have to communicate as clearly as possible about what&#8217;s happening out there right now. Says Perez, &#8220;You have to have a conversation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft&#8217;s customer security chief says as many as one-third of all government demands that the company receives for customer data are issued with secrecy clauses that prevents it from disclosing the search to the subject of the warrant.</p>
<p>The figure was disclosed in testimony by Microsoft&#8217;s Tom Burt ahead of a House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, as lawmakers weigh a legislative response to efforts by the Justice Department under the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/apple-google-leak-investigation-data-requests.html">secretly obtain call and email records</a> as part of an investigation into the leaks of classified information to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN.</p>
<p>Burt said that such secrecy orders &#8220;have unfortunately become commonplace,&#8221; and that Microsoft regularly receives &#8220;boilerplate secrecy orders unsupported by any meaningful legal or factual analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his testimony, Burt said that since 2016 Microsoft received between 2,400 to 3,500 secrecy orders each year, or 7-10 a day. Microsoft said in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report">its transparency report</a> that it received close to 11,200 legal orders from U.S. authorities last year.</p>
<p>By comparison, the U.S. courts approved 2,395 warrants with secrecy clauses a decade ago in 2010, which Burt said is fewer than the number of secrecy orders Microsoft alone received in any of the past five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are just the demands that Microsoft, just one cloud service provider, received. Multiply those numbers by every technology company that holds or processes data, and you may get a sense of the scope of the government’s overuse of secret surveillance,&#8221; Burt&#8217;s testimony says. &#8220;We are not suggesting that secrecy orders should only be obtained through some impossible standard. We simply ask that it be a meaningful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the controversy over secrecy orders came of late when secrecy orders served on Apple, Google, and Microsoft expired in recent weeks, allowing the companies to disclose to the news agencies that the Justice Department under the Trump administration had sought to obtain their records by demanding the data from the tech companies that host the data.</p>
<p>President Biden pledged to stop the collection of journalists&#8217; phone and email records, while also dropping some secrecy provisions. But lawmakers are likely to note that legislative change would be needed to codify policy into law.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Burt said the company will &#8220;do everything it can to prevent the misuse of secrecy orders.&#8221; The software and cloud giant also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/14/microsoft-sues-justice-department-for-transparency-in-government-data-searches/">sued the Justice Department in 2016</a> to challenge the constitutionality of gag orders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No, it&#8217;s not April Fool&#8217;s Day. But Twitter&#8217;s entire account has been taken over by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">NFTs</a>. As its new header reads: &#8220;I&#8217;ve stopped moisturizing because tweeting about NFTs is keeping me young now.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, the Twitter bird is going to look like a little baby duckling by the end of the day. This morning, Twitter posted, &#8220;140 free NFTs for 140 of you, besties,&#8221; nodding to Twitter&#8217;s initial 140 character limit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">140 free NFTs for 140 of you, besties <a href="https://t.co/0Pm0tNhIRg">pic.twitter.com/0Pm0tNhIRg</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1410227743636217856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In retrospect, we should&#8217;ve expected this after Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey sold <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">his first tweet as an NFT</a> earlier this year through a website called <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables by Cent</a>, which is unaffiliated with Twitter, yet gives people the option to mint and sell NFTs of tweets. Even Mark Cuban, who has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">investing in the NFT space</a>, <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/1355995109733621762?s=v_s">sold a tweet</a> on Valuables for 0.56 ETH, or $953 at the time. Dorsey&#8217;s NFT sold for 1630 ETH, which was worth about $2.9 million at the time of sale. He donated the proceeds to GiveDirectly to aid the COVID-19 response in Africa, but NFTs are still often criticized for their negative <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change">environmental impact</a> &#8212; others worry that the NFT market could just be a flash in the pan. But with major platforms like Twitter making NFTs, the fad might not be over just yet &#8212; or, Twitter could be testing the waters to gauge how its userbase reacts to an impromptu, free NFT drop before expanding its offerings in the space.</p>

<p>The catch with today&#8217;s Twitter NFT drop is that nobody can buy them &#8212; Twitter users can reply to the tweet for the chance to get one of 7 NFTs, which were minted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/nft-marketplace-startup-rarible-closes-14-2-million-series-a/">Rarible</a>, an NFT marketplace, in editions of 20, which makes 140 NFTs total.</p>
<p>According to Twitter, there have been over 29 million tweets on the platform about NFTs. What&#8217;s next for NFTs on Twitter? We&#8217;re not sure. But with Twitter&#8217;s rapid development of new features like Spaces, Super Follows, Twitter Blue, and more, it&#8217;s possible that this won&#8217;t be the last we hear about Twitter&#8217;s foray into crypto-powered collectibles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To train a robot to navigate a house, you either need to give it a lot of real time in a lot of real houses, or a lot of virtual time in a lot of virtual houses. The latter is definitely the better option, and Facebook and Matterport are working together to make thousands of virtual, interactive digital twins of real spaces available for researchers and their voracious young AIs.</p>
<p>On Facebook&#8217;s side the big advance is in two parts: <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/habitat-20-training-home-assistant-robots-with-faster-simulation-and-new-benchmarks">the new Habitat 2.0 training environment</a> and the dataset they created to enable it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/facebook-is-creating-photorealistic-homes-for-ais-to-work-and-learn-in/">You may remember Habitat from a couple years back</a>; in the pursuit of what it calls &#8220;embodied AI,&#8221; which is to say AI models that interact with the real world, Facebook assembled a number of passably photorealistic virtual environments for them to navigate.</p>
<p>Many robots and AIs have learned things like movement and object recognition in idealized, unrealistic spaces that resemble games more than reality. A real-world living room is a very different thing from a reconstructed one. By learning to move about in something that looks like reality, an AI&#8217;s knowledge will transfer more readily to real-world applications like home robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But ultimately these environments were only polygon-deep, with minimal interaction and no real physical simulation — if a robot bumps into a table, it doesn&#8217;t fall over and spill items everywhere. The robot could go to the kitchen, but it couldn&#8217;t open the fridge or pull something out of the sink. Habitat 2.0 and the new ReplicaCAD dataset change that with increased interactivity and 3D objects instead of simply interpreted 3D surfaces.</p>
<p>Simulated robots in these new apartment-scale environments can roll around like before, but when they arrive at an object, they can actually do something with it. For instance if a robot&#8217;s task is to pick up a fork from the dining room table and go place it in the sink, a couple years ago picking up and putting down the fork would just be assumed, since you couldn&#8217;t actually simulate it effectively. In the new Habitat system the fork is physically simulated, as is the table it&#8217;s on, the sink it&#8217;s going to, and so on. That makes it more computationally intense, but also way more useful.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb10vmYZ0Jc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the first to get to this stage by a long shot, but the whole field is moving along at a rapid clip and each time a new system comes out it leapfrogs the others in some ways and points at the next big bottleneck or opportunity. In this case Habitat 2.0&#8217;s nearest competition is probably AI2&#8217;s ManipulaTHOR, which combines room-scale environments with physical object simulation.</p>
<p>Where Habitat has it beat is in speed: according to the paper describing it, the simulator can run roughly 50-100 times faster, which means a robot can get that much more training done per second of computation. (The comparisons aren&#8217;t exact by any means and the systems are distinct in other ways.)</p>
<p>The dataset used for it is called ReplicaCAD, and it&#8217;s essentially the original room-level scans recreated with custom 3D models. This is a painstaking manual process, Facebook admitted, and they&#8217;re looking into ways of scaling it, but it provides a very useful end product.</p>

<p>More detail and more types of physical simulation are on the roadmap — basic objects, movements, and robotic presences are supported, but fidelity had to give way for speed at this stage.</p>
<p>Matterport is also making some big moves in partnership with Facebook. After making a huge platform expansion over the last couple years, the company has assembled an enormous collection of 3D-scanned buildings. Though it has worked with researchers before, the company <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/introducing-the-habitat-matterport-3d-research-data-set-for-training-embodied-ai">decided it was time to make a larger part of its trove available to the community</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hBfjACmpYr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/matterport-2/">Matterport raises $48M to ramp up its 3D imaging platform</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve Matterported every type of physical structure in existence, or close to it. Homes, high-rises, hospitals, office spaces, cruise ships, jets, Taco Bells, McDonalds&#8230; and all the info that is contained in a digital twin is very important to research,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/former-ebay-product-chief-rj-pittman-takes-the-reins-at-3d-capture-company-matterport/">CEO RJ Pittman told me</a>. &#8220;We thought for sure this would have implications for everything from doing computer vision to robotics to identifying household objects. Facebook didn&#8217;t need any convincing&#8230; for Habitat and embodied AI it is right down the center of the fairway.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end it created a dataset, HM3D, of a thousand meticulously 3D-captured interiors, from the home scans that real estate browsers may recognize to businesses and public spaces. It&#8217;s the largest such collection that has been made widely available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171836" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/matterport-hm3d.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171836" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/matterport-hm3d.gif" alt="3D spinning views of building interiors scanned by matterport." width="800" height="460" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2171836" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matterport</p></div></p>
<p>The environments, which are scanned an interpreted by an AI trained on precise digital twins, are dimensionally accurate to the point where, for example, exact numbers for window surface area or total closet volume can be calculated. It&#8217;s a helpfully realistic playground for AI models, and while the resulting dataset isn&#8217;t interactive (yet) it is very reflective of the real world in all its variance. (It&#8217;s distinct from the Facebook interactive dataset but could form the basis for an expansion.)</p>
<p>&#8220;It is specifically a diversified dataset,&#8221; said Pittman. &#8220;We wanted to be sure we had a rich grouping of different real world environments — you need that diversity of data if you want to get the most mileage out of it training an AI or robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the data was volunteered by the owners of the spaces, so don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s been sucked up unethically by some small print. Ultimately, Pittman explained, the company wants to create a larger, more parameterized dataset that can be accessed by API — realistic virtual spaces as a service, basically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re building a hospitality robot, for bed and breakfasts of a certain style in the U.S — wouldn&#8217;t it be great to be able to get a thousand of those?&#8221; he mused. &#8220;We want to see how far we can push advancements with this first dataset, get those learnings, then continue to work with the research community and our own developers and go from there. This is an important launching point for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both datasets will be open and available for researchers everywhere to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> started talking about a new set of communications tools <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">to enhance the text-based channels</a> at the end of last year. Today the company released a new audio tool called Slack Huddles and gave more details on a couple of other new tools including the ability to leave a video message and an enhanced employee directory, which you can access from inside Slack. All of these appear to have been designed with the changing nature of work in mind.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Slack Huddles, the audio tool that lets you have a real-time conversation with someone in Slack instead of typing out all of your thoughts. This will be much easier for people who find typing challenging, but the company also believes it will allow more spontaneous discussion, which mimics being in the office, at least to some degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huddles is a light-weight, audio-first way of communicating right in Slack. [It] recreates the spontaneous and serendipitous interactions that happen outside of scheduled meetings,&#8221; Tamar Yehoshua, chief product officer at Slack explained in a press briefing yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As companies continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">introduce more flexible working models</a>, they will have to adjust how they work. Huddles is one way of thinking about that, says Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some things can be synchronous, but only take three minutes. Instead of [scheduling a meeting for] next Tuesdays from 11:30 to 12 and [using] the whole half hour because that&#8217;s what we scheduled, it&#8217;s two or three minutes, right now, And if the conversation fizzles out in the Huddle you leave it open, maybe someone joins later and says something, which you wouldn&#8217;t do on a call,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<p>And recognizing that not everyone will be able to hear, the new tool includes real-time transcription.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=e2e2bElGoq" data-secret="e2e2bElGoq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has also been talking about providing some kind of video message capability since last year. The idea is almost like a video voicemail or an Instagram Story where you shoot a short video and post it in Slack. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about it and we believe that by giving people a way to expressively and asynchronously share and consume information we can enable people to be more flexible in how they work, and reduce the need for video meetings,&#8221; Yehoshua said.</p>
<p>The new feature will enable Slack users to play back video, voice and screen recordings natively in Slack. People can record and upload short clips into a channel or DM, &#8220;enabling others to watch and respond on their own schedule,&#8221; she explained.  While this feature isn&#8217;t ready to release yet, Yehoshua reported it is being piloted and will be available to paid teams some time in the coming months.</p>
<p>The last piece is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/slack-snags-corporate-directory-startup-rimeto-to-up-its-people-search-game/">the Rimeto acquisition</a>, which Slack bought last year with an eye toward upping their corporate directory piece. The Rimeto product has in fact been repurposed as Slack Atlas, a corporate directory that users can access right in Slack, rather than moving to another program to find that information. It&#8217;s another way Slack can keep users in Slack to find the information that they need, while avoiding context switching. This is currently in limited customer testing, but should be available some time later this year, according to the company.</p>
<p>Slack first announced these tools last year, initially saying they were experimental, but quickly shifting them to the product road map. Butterfield <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/">appeared in a Clubhouse interview</a> in March with former TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine, who is now a SignalFire investor ostensibly to talk about the future of work, but he also went into more detail about these tools for the first time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to wrap this discussion into the future of work, and indeed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Slack&#8217;s future as part of Salesforce</a>, which bought the communications tool for $27 billion last year. Work is changing and Slack is looking to be a broader part of that solution, whatever the future holds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drone delivery startup Zipline, a company that got its start delivering medical supplies across Africa, has raised $250 million in new funding. This latest round has vaulted the company’s valuation to $2.75 billion and will fuel further expansion of its logistics networks in Africa and the United States.</p>
<p>Zipline made a name for itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/09/zipline-raises-25-million-to-deliver-medical-supplies-by-drone/">first in Rwanda</a> and then in Ghana, where it delivered blood, vaccines, life-saving medications and other essential supplies using autonomous electric drones. The company, which launched in 2014, is vertically integrated – meaning it designs and manufactures the unmanned drones, the logistics software, and the accompanying launch and landing system. Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo told TechCrunch that this was more by necessity than design, noting that when the company first started developing its drone tech, it quickly realized that off-the-shelf components weren’t reliable or didn’t integrate well.</p>
<p>“Over time Zipline has had to basically rip every single thing out of the system, whether it was the flight computer [. . .] or the battery pack, or the aircraft itself. And we&#8217;ve had to build every single one of those things completely from scratch.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rinaudo stressed that Zipline doesn’t think of itself as a drone company, but rather an instant logistics provider. And while the company iteratively improves its autonomous drone model, much of its successes over the past five years have been related to building out its logistics network. After what Rinaudo described as a challenging first year of operations in Rwanda in 2016, the company has since partnered with logistics company UPS in that East African country, the Toyota Group in Japan, and it’s started working with Nigeria’s Kaduna and Cross River States. Here in the United States, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/zipline-begins-us-medical-delivery-with-uav-program-honed-in-africa/">partnered with Novant Health</a> to deliver medical equipment and personal protective gear in North Carolina and, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/walmart-expands-drone-delivery-tests-to-arkansas-with-new-zipline-partnership/">with retail giant Walmart</a> delivering health and wellness products.</p>
<p>Unlike many companies that suffered during the pandemic, for Zipline there was an obvious opportunity to further accelerate its operations – not only delivering personal protective equipment but also COVID-19 vaccines. The company said it is planning to deliver 2.4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Zipline sees an additional opportunity in delivering healthcare items, such as pharmaceutical prescriptions, directly to people’s homes. “[Hospitals] really see instant logistics as the other half of telepresence,” Rinaudo said. &#8220;If you can have someone quickly pull out their phone and talk to a doctor, then the other half of the equation is, can we get you what you need?”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171766" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171766" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png 1143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171766" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zipline</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s currently working with the Federal Aviation Administration to move from operating under an emergency waiver – granted by regulators during the pandemic – to a full commercial operating certification. One advantage Zipline may have over competitors in the FAA’s certification process is that it has many thousands of hours of safe flight data to show that it’s system is sound. It would be one of the first drone delivery companies to receive such a certification.</p>
<p>In the long run, Zipline may start to focus on other industries, but for now it’s laser focused on healthcare, Rinaudo said. He noted that in the last few months alone the company has signed service contracts for five new distribution centers in Nigeria and four in Ghana, as well as “multiple new service contracts” with hospital systems in the United States. This latest funding round, led by Baillie Gifford and with support from returning investors Temasek and Katalyst Ventures, and new investors Fidelity, Intercorp, Emerging Capital Partners and Reinvest Capital, will be used to build out the infrastructure for these new contracts.</p>
<p>Rinaudo said the aim is for Zipline to serve the majority of single-family detached homes across the United States over the coming three years or so.</p>
<p>“The fact that so many big companies like Toyota and Walmart are starting to make big bets in this instant logistics space, I think is a pretty clear sign that people realize this is coming,” Rinaudo said. “There&#8217;s a tidal wave of transformation coming. The exciting thing about it is that it&#8217;s going to totally transform the way that healthcare systems work, it&#8217;s going to totally transform the way that economic systems work, and it&#8217;s going to make it possible for logistics to serve people equally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, a unicorn that sells payroll and benefits management software, announced that it will now offer part of its service via an API to external platforms. The new product, dubbed Gusto Embedded Payroll, will allow vertical SaaS companies to provide payroll support to their own customers.</p>
<p>The move to provide elements of its service through other firms&#8217; offerings could bolster Gusto&#8217;s growth rate; for partner platforms the ability to provide payroll services may make their overall offering more attractive to small businesses.</p>
<p>According to Gusto co-founder and chief product officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon">Tomer London</a>, vertical SaaS companies are offering effectively a &#8220;business in a box&#8221; service today, making the addition of payroll to their own services a somewhat obvious move, as paying workers is a key element of running a company. Indeed, for many companies payroll is their largest expense.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the same interview, Gusto co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuareeves/">Josh Reeves</a> indicated that more of Gusto&#8217;s services could become accessible via externally facing APIs over time. Gusto was built using internal APIs to connect abstracted front and backends, London told TechCrunch, so much of Gusto could eventually become accessible by third-party developers without infinite lift by the company.</p>
<p>That Gusto, formerly ZenPayroll, is starting with payroll services is not a huge surprise given its history. What it adds next is a more interesting question. The company has raised hundreds of millions of dollars while private, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">including $200 million in 2019</a>. Gusto was last valued at $3.8 billion in 2019, according to <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SMB payroll startup Gusto raises $200M Series D, plans R&#038;D expansion to NYC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/embed/#?secret=NLhyFQKiwJ" data-secret="NLhyFQKiwJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The move to offer elements of the unicorn&#8217;s core service package to other companies via a programming hook was not a snap decision, the co-founders told TechCrunch. Instead, it was something that was discussed over a multi-year period while Gusto waited for the right market timing. The rise of vertical SaaS provided the correct moment in the company&#8217;s view. Which seems reasonable, frankly. An example will help explain why.</p>
<p>One early Gusto partner for its embedded payroll offering is Squire, a startup that TechCrunch has covered extensively. Squire is a vertical SaaS shop that makes software for barber shops. It raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/barbershop-management-platform-squire-raises-8-million-series-a-round/">$8 million in 2019</a>, $27 million in early 2020 and another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">$45 million later in the year</a>.</p>
<p>The company is a good example of the <em>build targeted software for a particular industry</em> model (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/wunderite-raises-3m-to-build-software-for-indie-insurance-agencies/">here&#8217;s a recent startup example</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/atlantas-singleops-raises-6m-for-its-outdoor-care-focused-software-business/">and another</a>). By implementing Gusto&#8217;s new embedded payroll service, Squire can offer its current and future customers a more complete digital application to help them run their IRL businesses. And Gusto will be able to drive more revenue from the same code it already uses to power its original offering.</p>
<p>The move by Gusto to open more of its service to other companies while also offering its traditional product fits neatly into a rising trend that TechCrunch has observed regarding more and more startups offering their service not via a managed service, but instead through an API. Gusto is not a young company in startup terms, but the adaptation of its service tracks with what we&#8217;re seeing from other technology upstarts.</p>
<p>According to the co-founders, its embedded payroll service will sport similar economics to its main offering. Gusto proper, Reeves told TechCrunch, grew 50% last year.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gay gave us an honest look into the life of creator <em>helper</em> turned creator <em>actual</em>, admitting that her current job path wasn&#8217;t possible in 2018. Somewhere, somehow, a VC in the distance heard that admittance as an opportunity to back a creator economy startup.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gay&#8217;s experience at Patreon, and why she left. Alex had some thoughts on the theme. It appears that growing list of creator-focused tools could increase the vapor pressure of folks who write, talk, art, and otherwise create, regarding their present-day employment.</li>
<li>Why one size doesn&#8217;t fit all when it comes to the diverse world of folks engaged in creative work. We also dipped our toes into the issue of indie creators needing to be CEOs as well as artists.</li>
<li>We chatted on Vibely, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/vibely-seed/">a startup that wants to make interactions with creators ~ multi-directional~ </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">and what it says about scaling time.</span></li>
<li>We also got into what an average day looks like for a full-time creator-comedian-podcaster, why she&#8217;s annoyed with how creators are discussed by founders and investors, and the tooling she hopes to see in the future.</li>
<li>And, well, we had to ask her if she&#8217;s starting a rolling fund too.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told, if you care about the economics of the creative world and want to add some nuance to your theories about it, it&#8217;s a fun episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a lot of us spending more time at home these days, home improvement has continued to be a booming market. Now, one of the big players in that space &#8212; <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceTitan</a>, which builds software that today is used by over 100,000 contractors to manage their work &#8212; is getting a little bigger.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; which also works with contractors that work on business properties &#8212; is acquiring <a href="https://www.youraspire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aspire Software</a>, a software provider specifically for commercial landscapers. Along with that, ServiceTitan is announcing another $200 million in funding, a Series G that values that company at $9.5 billion.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by a new backer, Thoma Bravo, with other unnamed existing investors participating. (That list includes Sequoia, Tiger Global, Dragoneer, T. <span class="xn-person">Rowe Price, </span>Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners and ICONIQ Capital.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Los Angeles-based ServiceTitan is not disclosing the financial terms of the deal, but it comes on the heels of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $500 million only in March</a> (when it was valued at $8.3 billion) &#8212; money that it earmarked at the time for acquisitions.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan also confirmed that this is its biggest acquisition yet, which roughly puts this deal in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Aspire will stay based in Missouri to build out the company further from there.</p>
<p>Aspire itself has some 50,000 users and sees $4 billion in annualized transactions on its platform across areas like landscaping, snow and ice management, and construction. It has never disclosed a valuation, nor how much money it has raised. The St Louis, MO company was previously backed by growth equity firm Mainsail Partners.</p>
<p>The deal underscores not just how much scale and opportunity remains in building technology to serve the home services space, but also what might be a consolidating trend within that, where a smaller number of companies are building technology for contractors and others in the space working across a number of adjacent and related verticals.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan is already bringing in annual recurring revenues of $250 million &#8212; a figure it shared in March and hasn&#8217;t updated &#8212; and as of that month, it had grown 50% over the preceding year. Part of that growth is based on simply more usage of and demand for its software, but part of it also has to do with the company expanding what it covers.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan got its start in residential plumbing, HVAC and electrical &#8212; the areas where the the two founders Ara Mahdessian (CEO) and Vahe Kuzoyan (president) went first because they knew them best from their own family businesses &#8212; but expanded into areas like garage door, chimney and other areas, as well as commercial property, on its own steam.</p>
<p>In other markets like landscaping or pest control, the expertise is more specialized, however, so it makes sense to make acquisitions in those areas to bring in that software, and teams to manage and build it, to further diversify the company. (ServicePro, a pest control company, was acquired in February.)</p>
<p>ServiceTitan said that its contractor customers have made more than $20 billion in transactions in the last year, but with the wider industry of contracting repair and maintenance services estimated to be worth $1 trillion, there is obviously a lot more potential. Hence expanding the range of areas covered in the industry.</p>
<p>“Both Aspire and ServiceTitan were born out of a desire to improve the lives of contractors who work tirelessly to serve their communities, but who have historically been underserved by technology,” said Mahdessian in a statement. “Mark and his team at Aspire have more than 500 years of combined experience in the commercial landscaping industry. Just like we built ServiceTitan to solve the problems our fathers faced, it’s that first-hand industry knowledge that has enabled Aspire to build the most powerful software in the industry with the highest customer satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Thoma Bravo has been making some prolific moves to take majority positions in a number of older tech companies in recent weeks (see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/thoma-bravo-take-qad-inc-private-2-bln-2021-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QAD</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proofpoint</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/talend-to-be-acquired-by-thoma-bravo-in-a-2-4-billion-transaction-301244507.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talend</a> for three examples among others). This, however, is a growth investment that is coming as many wonder when and if ServiceTitan might go public.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get a chance to ask Mahdessian about that later but in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March</a> he hinted that an IPO might come later this year or latest by the end of 2022, depending on market conditions. This Series G round implies perhaps stretching to the later part of that timeframe.</p>
<p>“As the fastest-growing software solution for the trades with an unrelenting focus on customer success, ServiceTitan is poised to extend its leadership and capture increased market share as the industry exceeds $1 trillion globally,” said Robert (Tre) Sayle, a partner at Thoma Bravo, in a statement. “ServiceTitan’s expansion into landscaping, a more than $100 billion market in the US alone, is an important step on its path to provide all home and commercial tradesmen with the tools they need to grow and manage a successful business. We are excited to partner with ServiceTitan and to leverage our software and operational expertise to accelerate the company’s growth and build upon its strong momentum.”</p>
<p>There are a number of companies playing in the wider home services market that speak to the opportunity ahead. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/thumbtack-home-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thumbtack</a> are digging deeper into home management, providing a bridge to contractors to fill out the work needed (and also providing them with the software to do so), while companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/bigchange-raises-102m-for-a-platform-to-help-manage-service-fleets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigChange</a>, which have also raised recently, are also looking to build better software to manage individual and fleets of contractors and their fleets.</p>
<p>ServiceTitan, the biggest of the software players now, is likely going to continue making more deals to grow its own empire, but it added that it will also be using the funding to expand more organically, with investments into customer service, R&amp;D, and to hire more people across the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Pittsburgh Strip District, once home to Industrial Age giants Alcoa, Heinz, U.S. Steel and Westinghouse, has evolved over the past decade into a technology and robotics hub, and notably, a testbed of autonomous vehicles.  That activity has more recently spilled out beyond Smallman Street, so-called Robotics Row, past the confines of the Strip District and Lower Lawrenceville and into adjoining neighborhoods to the north and south.</p>
<p>And while, Argo AI, Aurora Innovation (as well as its newly acquired addition Uber ATG) and Motional are the most visible examples of autonomous vehicle testing and development in the city, numerous other AV startups have popped up in the past six years — each one betting that its application will provide the quickest path to commercialization.</p>
<p>Locomation, a startup founded in 2018 that is working on autonomous trucks, is one of them. The co-founders, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">who met at the National Robotics Engineering Center, an operating unit within Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute, believe the smoothest, fastest route to autonomous trucks is to use a human-guided convoy system first. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Locomation contends that autonomous trucks that can operate without a human safety driver behind the wheel will happen eventually and after considerable validation. But until then, the company is pitching a convoy system, in which a lead driver pilots a truck and another truck follows it autonomously. The autonomous one will also have a driver, but that individual will be resting and is considered a passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided that we needed to expose the (autonomous) system to the real world in a safe and profitable way,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Çetin Meriçli told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that is how the idea of human-guided autonomous driving came about. &#8220;We are still building a Level 4 system with an extremely narrow operational design domain that can drive itself and it doesn&#8217;t require a driver in the seat as long as there is a human driven lead track right in front of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locomation&#8217;s starting point is a two-driver, two-truck system for long haul routes. When the lead driver is in place, the following driver is resting in the other vehicle. Both trucks are equipped with a self-driving system so they can periodically swap positions.  However, Meriçli noted that while the lead driver is operating the vehicle, the autonomous system is only assisting the person.</p>

<hr />
<p>&#8220;There is some automation there, but we don&#8217;t think it is a good idea to automate the lead truck so much that the lead driver can actually become complacent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Keeping the driver engaged enough and at the same time trying to reduce the cognitive load as much as possible is a very delicate balance to hit there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drivers then take over manual driving once they leave the interstate.</p>
<p>The next phase is what Locomation calls the drone follower system designed for shorter haul routes of 250 miles or less. This system involves one driver and two trucks, one lead and one following behind autonomously.</p>
<p>These two human guided convoy concepts will help the company progress to an autonomous system in which trucks operate without humans between hubs on an interstate and then eventually to dock to dock, which would include non-interstate roads.</p>
<p>Locomation has a contract to equip 1,120 Wilson Logistics trucks with its autonomous relay convoy technology over the next five years. The first trucks are expected to be delivered in 2022. The company recently signed an eight-year agreement to supply PGT Trucking with the systems for 1,000 trucks.</p>
<p>Today, Locomation is in test mode, although it has hauled some freight. That means safety drivers are always behind the wheel. Eventually, it will transition to a commercial operation, which Meriçli said the company is aiming to launch in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>To reach that goal, Locomation is doing what some many others are aiming for: raising money, recruiting talent and expanding. Locomation, which currently operates across the Alleghany River from Pittsburgh&#8217;s Strip District, will soon move to larger facility in the Tech Forge section.</p>
<p>Mericli said there are at least two dozen startups working on autonomous vehicle technology in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them are really little hole in the wall operations, maybe a couple of folks,&#8221; Mericli said. &#8221; Many of them are actually the second generation or third generation; they started their careers in one of these larger companies, worked there for a number of years, identified a few pain points and either got frustrated with the slow progress or got bit by the entrepreneurship bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not quite like Silicon Valley, just yet,&#8221; Mericli said, adding that it is getting closer to that West Coast hub of tech. &#8220;What I see here, which was not the case a couple of years ago, is that now there are some role models, some success stories, some big achievers, like the Argos and Auroras of the world. Hopefully, Locomation is climbing those ladders too. Now young people and new entrepreneurs coming out of the CMU ecosystem, the way they are thinking about their business and their aspirations, it&#8217;s getting closer to the Silicon Valley mindset.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My husband and I are both U.S. permanent residents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Given what we’ve gone through this past year being isolated from loved ones during the pandemic, we’d like to bring my parents and my sister to the U.S. to be close to our family and help out with our children. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Symbiotic in Sunnyvale</strong></p>
<p>Dear Symbiotic,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question! Yes, it’s possible to bring your parents and sister to the United States! We have a lot of clients like you who are looking to reunite with their families. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I discussed in a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/077-immigration-for-children-and-dependents/">podcast episode</a> what U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents should know about bringing family members to the United States. In that episode, we also discuss certificates of citizenship for individuals who are U.S. citizens born abroad.</p>
<p>As always, I suggest you consult with an experienced immigration attorney in petitioning for green cards for your parents and sister. An immigration attorney can also discuss alternative immigration options for your sister.</p>

<p><strong>Who can I sponsor as a permanent resident? As a U.S. citizen?</strong></p>
<p>U.S. permanent residents — or green card holders — can only sponsor a spouse or unmarried children for a green card. But if you have lived in the U.S. for at least five years as a green card holder, you are eligible to become a U.S. citizen. U.S. citizens who are at least 21 years old can sponsor a broader list of family members for green cards: parents, spouses, children and stepchildren, brothers and sisters.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online electric micromobility dealership </span><a href="https://www.ridepanda.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has announced a raise of $3.75 million that the startup will use to build out its</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">engineering, product and design teams to boost its e-commerce and B2B solutions. The company also wants to double down on strategic partnerships with delivery fleets and businesses offering employees commuter benefits if they purchase an electric vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, e-bike and e-scooter sales skyrocketed. A </span><a href="https://www.bicycleassociation.org.uk/mds-2020-covid-impact-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bicycle Association report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailing the impact of COVID-19 on the U.K. cycling economy from January to October 2020 revealed sales of e-bikes more than doubled. Between April and September, they saw a 92% YoY rise in sales. </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2020/bike-technology-transformation.html/#endnote-sup-59"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte has predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in 2023, e-bike sales will top 40 million units worldwide, generating over $22 billion. In a market increasingly favorable to electric micromobility options, Ridepanda’s business could lead sales of electric bikes, scooters and mopeds for both consumers and fleets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“60% of in-car trips take place within zero to five miles, and we think there is a better way to go,” CEO and co-founder of Ridepanda, Chinmay Malaviya, told TechCrunch. “Electric cars is one solution, but we think that our vehicles are cheaper, a lot more accessible, more affordable, more practical, better for traffic congestion, easy to store, easy to park, easy to charge, environmentally friendly and a lot more fun because of the added health benefits.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lime and Scoot veterans have built Ridepanda, a one-stop micromobility marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/lime-and-scoot-veterans-have-built-ridepanda-a-one-stop-micromobility-marketplace/embed/#?secret=baKrwvl8dW" data-secret="baKrwvl8dW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda, which is based in San Francisco but ships to 48 U.S. states, offers a suite of light electric vehicles, from Segway-Ninebot e-scooters to Aventon e-bikes to Niu e-mopeds. The company would not reveal how many vehicles it’s sold since its founding in 2019, but Malaviya told TechCrunch it’s a four-digit number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CTO Charlie Depman says e-bikes are the most popular, directly followed by scooters. Mopeds still have some room for growth, but Depman suspects part of the reason for the lower sales in that category are ongoing pandemic-related, supply-chain issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda vets each vehicle on its site upfront, ensuring all parts are high quality and easy to repair and replace, something that’s very useful if you’ve ever had the frustrating experience of taking your malfunctioning e-scooter to a traditional bike shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a user comes to Ridepanda’s site, they can use the refined recommendation engine which helps customers choose the right vehicle for their particular use case, whether that’s commuting in the city or leisure rides in the suburbs and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A fifth of our customers don’t know what type of vehicle they want when they come to our site,” Depman told TechCrunch. “We give you a ranked set of recommendations for your use case and feature preferences, and you’ll be taken to the vehicle page where we show you more about our dealership and offer maintenance plans, roadside assistance, et cetera to make ownership easy. Basically it’s as easy as it is to own a car, but a lot of this infrastructure isn’t in place for light electric vehicle ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicles are mailed directly to the customer, who can choose to assemble it or have a trained technician come to the house for home assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s this hands-on approach that the company wants to improve with the fresh funding, specifically automating the post-purchase fulfillment process and building out after sales service in the form of its PandaCare app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“PandaCare has been our flagship dealership offering that has all of the maintenance and roadside assistance and extended warranty,” said Depman. “So ideally this app would entail having access to all those services and being able to call a mechanic to come work on your vehicle. It could also notify you about doing preventative maintenance, or notify us about doing preventative maintenance, so we can help extend the vehicle&#8217;s lifetime.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridepanda is also working on creating a more personalized geographic approach on the product side. Laws and regulations around these vehicles differ from state to state, as do potential rebates and purchase incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon introduced the </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment (E-BIKE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would give a 30% refundable tax credit on the purchase of a new e-bike. The bill hasn’t yet made its way through Congress, but if it passes, and there’s good reason to think it might, Ridepanda hopes to be able to help facilitate the corresponding rise in sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malaviya said Ridepanda is also partnering with the county of San Mateo’s utility provider Peninsula Clean Energy to roll out local e-bike rebates, helping low income communities access them at the point of purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very excited to see how we can play a role as a tech partner, as well as a choice platform for consumers in terms of integrating and making it very seamless and easy for folks to take advantage of these rebates and subsidies out there,” said Malaviya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $3.75 million round, which is an extension of the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/lime-and-scoot-veterans-have-built-ridepanda-a-one-stop-micromobility-marketplace/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company’s seed funding last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is led by Porsche Ventures, Yamaha and Proeza Ventures, with participation from angel investor Toby Sun, co-founder of Lime, and Silicon Valley VC General Catalyst, according to Malaviya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot we can gain from these partnerships,” said Malaviya. “From Yamaha, how do you manage dealerships to supply chains to even actually getting access to the bikes and mopeds? Same with Porsche. They also released a high-end e-bike and we’re excited to also work with them in accessing dealerships and the product, and also the branding piece. And Proeza, we’re pretty excited for all the supply chain expertise we can gain. What is also key about these folks is Porshe’s HQ is in Germany, Yamaha in Japan and Proeza in Latin America. As we look to go outside of the U.S., this could be very helpful.”</span></p>
