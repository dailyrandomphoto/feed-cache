										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another UK parliamentary committee has weighed in on the government&#8217;s controversial plan to regulate Internet content with a broadbrush focus on &#8216;safety&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, warned in detailed <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8608/documents/86960/default/">report</a> today that it has &#8220;urgent concerns&#8221; the draft legislation &#8220;neither adequately protects freedom of expression nor is clear and robust enough to tackle the various types of illegal and harmful content on user-to-user and search services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among the committee&#8217;s myriad worries are how fuzzily the bill defines different types of harms, such as illegal content &#8212; and  designations of harms &#8212; with MPs calling out the government&#8217;s failure to include more detail in the bill itself, making it harder to judge impact as key components (like Codes of Practice) will follow via secondary legislation so aren&#8217;t yet on the table.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261045" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That general vagueness, combined with the complexities related to the choice for a &#8220;duty of care&#8221; approach &#8212; which the report notes in fact breaks down into several specific duties (vis-a-vis illegal content; content that poses a risk to children; and, for a subset of high risk P2P services, content that poses a risk to adults) &#8212; means the proposed framework may not be able to achieve the sought for &#8220;comprehensive safety regime&#8221;, in the committee&#8217;s view.</p>
<p>The bill also creates risks for freedom of expression, per the committee &#8212; which has recommended the government incorporates a balancing test for the regulator, Ofcom, to assess whether platforms have &#8220;duly balanced their freedom of expression obligations with their decision making&#8221;.</p>
<p>The risk of platforms responding to sudden, ill-defined liability around broad swathes of content by over-removing speech &#8212; leading to a chilling impact on freedom of expression in the UK &#8212; is one of the many criticisms raised against the bill which the committee appears to be picking up on.</p>
<p>It suggests the government reframes definitions of harmful content and relevant safety duties to bring the bill in<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> line with international human rights law &#8212; in order to try to safeguard against the risk of over-removal by providing &#8220;minimum standards against which a provider’s actions, systems and processes to tackle harm, including automated or algorithmic content moderation, should be judged&#8221;.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even on child safety &#8212; a core issue UK ministers have repeatedly pinned to the legislation &#8212; the committee flags &#8220;weaknesses&#8221; in the bill that they assert mean the proposed regime &#8220;does not map adequately onto the reality of the problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>They have called for the government to go further in this area, urging the bill to be expanded to cover &#8220;technically legal&#8221; practices, such as breadcrumbing (aka &#8220;where perpetrators deliberately subvert the thresholds of criminal activity and for content removal by a service provide&#8221;) &#8212; citing witness testimony which suggests the practice, while not in fact illegal, &#8220;nonetheless forms part of the sequence for online CSEA [child sexual exploitation and abuse]&#8221;.</p>
<p>Similarly, the committee suggests the bill needs to go further to protect women and girls against types of online violence and abuse specifically directed at them (such as &#8220;tech-enabled ‘nudifying’ of women and deepfake pornography&#8221;).</p>
<p>On Ofcom&#8217;s powers of investigation of platforms, the committee argues they need to be further strengthened &#8212; urging amendments to give the regulator the power to &#8220;conduct confidential auditing or vetting of a service’s systems to assess the operation and outputs in practice&#8221;; and to &#8220;request generic information about how &#8216;content is disseminated by means of a service'&#8221;, with MPs further suggesting the bill should provide more specific detail about the types of data Ofcom can request from platforms (presumably to avoid the risk of platforms seeking to evade effective oversight).</p>
<p>However &#8212; on enforcement &#8212; the committee has concerns in the other direction and is worried over a lack of clarity over how Ofcom&#8217;s (set to be) very substantial powers may be used against platforms.</p>
<p>It has recommended a series of tweaks, such as making clear these powers only apply to in-scope services.</p>
<p>MPs are also calling for a redrafting of the use of so-called &#8220;technology notices&#8221; &#8212; which will enable the regulator to mandate the use of new technology (following &#8220;persistent and prevalent&#8221; failings of the duty of care) &#8212; saying the scope and application of this power should be &#8220;more tightly&#8221; defined, and more practical information provided on the actions required to bring providers into compliance, as well as more detail on how Ofcom will test whether the use of such power is proportionate.</p>
<p>Here the committee flags issues of potential business disruption. It also suggests the government take time to evaluate whether these powers are &#8220;appropriately future-proofed given the advent of technology like VPNs and DNS over HTTPs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Other recommendations in the report include a call for the bill to contain more clarity on the subject of redress and judicial review.</p>
<p>The committee also warns against the government creating a dedicated joint committee to oversee online safety and digital regulation, arguing that parliamentary scrutiny is &#8220;best serviced by the existing, independent, cross-party select committees and evidenced by the work we have done and will continue to do in this area&#8221;.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re concerned that the Draft <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnlineSafetyBill?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OnlineSafetyBill</a> neither adequately protects freedom of expression nor is it clear/robust enough to tackle illegal &amp; harmful content.</p>

<p>&mdash; Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (@CommonsDCMS) <a href="https://twitter.com/CommonsDCMS/status/1485403222118477830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It remains to be seen how much notice the government takes of the committee&#8217;s recommendations. Although the secretary of state for digital, Nadine Dorries, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/">previously suggested</a> she is open to taking on board parliamentary feedback to the sweeping package of legislation.</p>
<p>The report, by the DCMS Committee, follows earlier recommendations &#8212; in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/uk-joint-committee-report-online-safety-bill/">December</a> &#8212; by a parliamentary joint committee focused on scrutinizing the bill which also warned that the draft legislation risked falling short of the government&#8217;s safety aims.</p>
<p>The government published the draft Online Safety bill back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">May 2021</a> &#8212; setting out a long-trailed plan to impose a duty of care on Internet platforms with the aim of protecting users from a swathe of harms, whether related to (already illegal) content such as terrorist propaganda, child sexual abuse material and hate speech, through more broadly problematic but not necessarily illegal content such as bullying or content promoting eating disorders or suicide (which may create disproportionate risks for younger users of social media platforms).</p>
<p>Speaking to the joint committee in November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/">Dorries predicted </a>the legislation will usher in a systemic change to Internet culture &#8212; telling MPs and peers it will create &#8220;huge, huge&#8221; change to how Internet platforms operate.</p>
<p>The bill, which is still making its way through parliament, targets a broad range of Internet platforms and envisages enforcing safety-focused governance standards via regulated Codes of Conduct, overseen by Ofcom in an expanded role &#8212; including with incoming powers to issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">substantial penalties for breaches</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fTqK29Z0xv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">UK Online Safety Bill, coming next year, will propose fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaching duty of care rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK Online Safety Bill, coming next year, will propose fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaching duty of care rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/embed/#?secret=fTqK29Z0xv" data-secret="fTqK29Z0xv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The sweeping scope of the regulation &#8212; the intent for the law to target not just illegal content spreading online but stuff that falls into more of a grey area where restrictions risk impinging on freedom of expression and speech &#8212; mean the proposal has attracted huge criticism from civil liberties and digital rights groups, as well as from businesses concerned about liability and the compliance burden.</p>
<p>In parallel, the government has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">stepping up attacks on platforms&#8217; use of end-to-end encryption</a> &#8212; deploying rhetoric that seeks to imply robust security is a barrier to catching pedophiles (see, for example, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/no_place_hide_campaign_anti_e2ee_ukgov/">government&#8217;s recently unveiled NoPlaceToHide PR to try to turn the public against E2E encryption</a>). So critics are also concerned that ministers are trying to subvert Internet security and privacy by recasting good practices as barriers to a goal imposing &#8216;child safety&#8217; through mass digital surveillance.</p>
<p>On that front, in recent months, the Home Office has also been splashing a little taxpayer cash to try to foster the development of technologies which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">could be applied to E2EE systems to scan for child sexual abuse material</a> &#8212; which it claims could offer a middle ground between robust security and law enforcement&#8217;s data access requirements.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill already argue that using a trumped up claim of child &#8216;protection&#8217; as a populist lever to push for the removal of the strongest security and privacy protections from all Internet users &#8212; simultaneously encouraging a cottage industry of commercial providers to spring up and tout &#8216;child protection&#8217; surveillance services for sale &#8212; is a lot closer to gaslighting than safeguarding, however.</p>
<p>Zooming back out, there is also plenty of concern over the risk of the UK over regulating its digital economy.</p>
<p>And of the bill becoming a parliamentary &#8220;hobby horse&#8221; for every type of online grievance, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/ex-minister-predicts-huge-battleground-over-uks-plan-to-set-internet-content-rules/">one former minister of state put it</a> &#8212; with the potential for complex and poorly defined content regulation to end up as a disproportionate burden on UK startups vs tech giants like Facebook whose self-serving algorithms and content moderation fuelled calls for Internet regulation in the first place, as well as being hugely harmful to UK Internet users&#8217; human rights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Amid the deal-making and partnership news this week, one item raised both of my eyebrows. Although I must admit, I wasn&#8217;t exactly surprised. I&#8217;m talking about the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its plans to develop a new rating program that will evaluate the safeguards that vehicles with &#8220;partial automation&#8221; use to help drivers stay focused on the road.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>IIHS, a nonprofit that is funded by auto insurance companies, will give systems good, acceptable, marginal or poor ratings. The first set of ratings is expected to be issued in 2022, IIHS said, though it did not give a specific date because ongoing supply chain issues have made it more difficult to obtain vehicles for testing.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s takeaway? Not a single advanced driver assistance system offered in today&#8217;s new vehicles would meet its pending safety criteria. You can read my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/advanced-driver-assistance-tech-in-cars-today-wont-pass-iihs-new-safety-rating/">full coverage of this here</a>; but for those who don&#8217;t click that link, here are two important items to consider.</p>
<p>1.) While most partial automation systems — think of the combination of lane centering and adaptive cruise control — have some safeguards in place, none of them meets all of the organization&#8217;s pending criteria. This can lead to drivers intentionally or unintentionally pushing the system well beyond its safe operation.</p>
<p>2.) This new IIHS rating system isn&#8217;t even addressing other <strong>functional </strong>aspects of the systems that could also potentially contribute to crashes, such as how well their cameras or radar sensors identify obstacles. That&#8217;s a much bigger and complex issue. Who do you think should take that on?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Side note: Consumer Reports&#8217; 2022 autos Top Picks, which will be announced on February 17, will include evaluations of driver monitoring systems. CR will add two points to a vehicle&#8217;s overall score if it features a system that encourages safe driving as part of the model&#8217;s active driving assistance package.</p>
<p>One final, maybe fun? item. I went back and looked at my predictions for 2021. They&#8217;re all here in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/the-station-the-2021-predictions-issue-part-two/">The Station edition</a> from January 11, 2021 (this is the second part, but I also recap the first part at the bottom). Check it out, and give me a grade. ;D</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk a little about how cities are embracing micromobility, and how they can improve. </span></p>
<p><b>Transport for London</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorofLondon/status/1483096249817608195?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently released stats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that showed the share of journeys made in the city by cycling or walking has increased from 27% to 42% during the pandemic. Even more promising is the </span><a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/studies-reports/2022/01/16/more-half-women-cyclists-started-riding-or-returned-during-pandemic#.Yeh-1lhBz0p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bicycle Dealers Association&#8217;s Bicycling Buying 2021 Consumer Research study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which found 56% of female bicyclists who are riding today either started cycling or returned to it during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All great signs that the momentum is here, but cities need to step up their infrastructure game. </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/3-in-4-people-want-to-ride-a-bike-but-are-put-off-by-lack-of-safe-lanes-172868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Victoria, Australia found that 75% of respondents are interested in biking, but are concerned about lack of safety infrastructure. The Aussies are no doubt not the only ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t only come down to infrastructure. Cities also need to be working with micromobility companies to ensure easy and affordable access to bikes and scooters. Look at Prague as an example. The city </span><a href="https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/prague-public-transport-s-free-bikesharing-program-to-become-permanent-offer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently decided to make free 15-minute bikeshare rides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a permanent part of its public transport offer. New York City is also working with Brooklyn-based bike and scooter subscription service </span><b>Beyond</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://cities-today.com/new-yorks-transit-tech-lab-announces-covid-19-response-challenge-winners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study how micromobility can be integrated with public transit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(NYC is also working with </span><b>Lyft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer free 60-day </span><b>Citibike </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">memberships to public and private hospital workers who are battling rising Covid-19 Omicron cases.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, yet another micromobility startup, </span><b>Helbiz</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is integrating with Google Maps worldwide, which will no doubt help micromobility become more a part of the broader transit ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/stockholm-sweden-clampdown-e-scooters-voi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stockholm is actually reducing the number of shared e-scooters in the city by 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the apparent chaos of so 23,000 scooters roaming around. The city will allow all eight of its current micromobility providers to continue operating a reduced service. While I initially wince at the thought of cutting back greener forms of transit, public opinion is important for long-term adoption. A recent </span><a href="https://www.dn.se/sthlm/stockholmare-allt-mer-negativt-installda-till-elsparkcyklar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Stockholmers found 57% were negative about e-scooters, versus 50% last year.</span></p>

<p>OK, so this isn&#8217;t a traditional company X raises $$$ type of deal, but this week we&#8217;re mixing it up. I find this item notable because it illustrates increasing interest from traditional automakers to use lidar in passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>The gist: <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> agreed to use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/mercedes-future-vehicles-will-have-luminar-lidar-under-new-deal/">Luminar&#8217;s </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/mercedes-future-vehicles-will-have-luminar-lidar-under-new-deal/">lidar technology</a> in future vehicles as part of a broader deal that includes data sharing and the automaker taking a small stake in the company. Mercedes-Benz will acquire up to 1.5 million Luminar shares, in exchange for certain data and services.</p>
<p>The companies declined to share information about when Luminar lidar would be integrated into Mercedes-Benz vehicles. I went back and listened to an interview I had with Markus Schäfer, Daimler AG board member and Mercedes-Benz AG&#8217;s CTO responsible for development and procurement. We were talking about the EQXX Vision, a halo car of sorts that was revealed earlier this month ahead of the CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>The vehicle, which went from idea to prototype in 18 months, is meant be the foundation for its future electric vehicles and it featured all sorts of technological innovations with the battery and drivetrain as well as other items that Schäfer said will be in Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles beginning in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps Luminar&#8217;s lidar will also show up in 2024 model year Mercedes vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong> Factorial Energy </strong><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/20/2369935/0/en/Factorial-Energy-Raises-200-Million-To-Accelerate-Commercialization-of-its-Novel-Solid-state-Batteries-for-Electric-Vehicles.html">raised $200 million</a> as part of a Series D round of funding that was led by automakers Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. The company said the funding will be used to accelerate commercial production and deployment of its solid-state battery technology.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Gogoro</strong>, the Taiwanese company best known for its electric smartscooters and swappable battery infrastructure, has just added current strategic partner <strong>Hero MotoCorp</strong>, activist and impact investment firm <strong>Engine No. 1</strong> and another investor to its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/hero-motocorp-engine-no-1-join-gogoros-pipe-bringing-it-up-to-285m/"> PIPE investment, bringing the total funding to $285 million, up from $257 million</a>. The company still intends to complete its SPAC deal with <strong>Poema Global </strong>by the end of this quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Monta</strong>, the electric vehicle charging platform, closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Creandum, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Stockholm. The company said that Headline also made a significant investment.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Systems</strong>, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/former-spacex-engineers-bring-autonomous-electric-rail-vehicle-startup-out-of-stealth/">came out of stealth mode</a> with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Auto</strong>, a startup that has developed remote operation software for vehicles, received a strategic investment of $42 million led by freight and logistics service provider ArcBest and NFI. As part of the deal, ArcBest and NFI reached a commercial agreement to deploy thousands of Phantom-powered forklifts in the coming years. The funding also includes investment from Bessemer Venture Partners, Maniv Mobility, Perot Jain, and other previous investors. Phantom Auto initially focused on the autonomous vehicle industry, but pivoted to logistics vehicles like forklifts. Last March, global logistics company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/logistics-giant-geodis-partners-with-phantom-auto-to-deploy-remote-controlled-forklifts/">Geodis tapped Phantom Auto</a> to help it deploy remotely operated forklifts at two sites and eventually expand to other warehouses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Inventa’s online platform recommends products based on actual transaction data and provides credit, in 30-, 60-, and 90-day increments, to retailers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inventa, a Brazil-based company offering a digital marketplace for small and medium-sized companies to discover and purchase new inventory, raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz and Monashees co-led the round and were joined by Founders Fund, Greenoaks, Greylock, Tiger Global and angel investors Hans Tung and Carlos Gracia from Kavak. Also participating in the round were existing investors Pear VC, NXTP, ONEVC, MAYA Capital and Alter Global.</p>
<p>This fresh infusion of capital comes three months after the company announced $5.5 million in seed funding. And all of that for a company that started in March 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260870" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Marcos Salama founded the company with former General Atlantic investor Laura Camargo and former McKinsey data science expert Fernando Carrasco to provide technology, data and credit to Brazilian entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Salama, who is from Spain, has a background in mechanical engineering and has worked for both McKinsey and Rappi, which is how he made his way to Brazil. While leading Rappi’s groceries business, he worked with retailers and saw how small stores were struggling to access an assortment of goods and credit.</p>
<p><a href="https://inventa.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inventa</a> uses technology to provide an easier purchasing process for small businesses. Inventa’s online platform recommends products based on actual transaction data and provides credit, in 30-, 60- and 90-day increments, to retailers. There is also a supplier side, where they can upload products, manage pricing and see what is selling and what isn’t.</p>
<p>One of the drivers for going after additional funding so soon was that Inventa is growing at over 100% month over month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are 5 million entrepreneurs who have small stores in Brazil that Inventa is targeting,” Salama said. “Our B2B marketplace connects brands and small retailers to help them with assortment in the areas of cosmetics, healthy food and home decor. They can also see what is trending, which makes recommendations more useful.”</p>
<p>The company offers over 7,000 products from 400 brands and has amassed more than 20,000 customers.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Inventa to invest in its technology team — much of its 100-person workforce is in engineering — and to build its sales and marketing teams. Salama expects to grow massively in the employee area with a goal of adding another 400 people in the next few years.</p>
<p>He also plans to grow its brands to 10,000 as Inventa goes deeper into the cosmetics, healthy foods and home decor verticals. In addition, the company will focus on its technology development so that it can eventually offer a free software product for small suppliers and retailers.</p>
<p>“Amazon, MercadoLibre and Rappi are catering to the business-to-consumer world, but in B2B, there are much less companies targeting this market,” Salama said. “It is large, but there are no solutions, so we are ready to serve them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather forecast company <a href="https://www.accuweather.com">AccuWeather</a> is acquiring French startup <a href="https://plumelabs.com/en/">Plume Labs</a> —&nbsp;terms of the deal are undisclosed. Originally founded in 2014, Plume Labs has gradually expanded its product offering to offer three different products focused on air pollution data.</p>
<p>First, the startup launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/plume-air-report-is-a-weather-forecasting-app-for-urban-air-pollution/">a mobile app</a> for iOS and Android that gives you information about air quality. At first, it was a simple city-level air pollution forecasting app. The company would aggregate data from different sources to predict how pollution would evolve over time.</p>
<p>Over time, Plume Labs improved its forecasting abilities as it can now predict air quality for the next few days. Plue Labs uses some machine learning models for its predictions. It now also offers detailed maps with street-by-street information. This way, if you’re commuting to work on a bike or a moped, you know that you should avoid a busy street in particular.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261062" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Plume Labs then wanted to empower its users by making air quality tracking visual and actionable. That’s why it designed its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/plume-labs-flow-is-an-air-quality-tracker-to-avoid-pollution/">air quality tracker</a> that connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth Low Energy.</p>
<p>The second-generation device can track particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) as well as polluting gases (nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds). It&#8217;s been relatively successful as there are currently more Plume Labs devices being used than government-supported monitoring stations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plume Labs’ Flow is an air quality tracker to avoid pollution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/plume-labs-flow-is-an-air-quality-tracker-to-avoid-pollution/embed/#?secret=QfsdteiDwz" data-secret="QfsdteiDwz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Finally, Plume Labs started offering air pollution data as <a href="https://plumelabs.com/en/forecast-api/">an API</a>. The company has aggregated thousands of environmental monitoring stations around the world and applied its machine learning model on this data. This way, Plume Labs customers get a head start if they want to integrate air quality data in their products. They don&#8217;t have to deal with different data sources and unify these data sets into a single set. Similarly, they don&#8217;t have to allocate resources on machine learning applied to air pollution.</p>
<p>In January 2020, AccuWeather integrated Plume Labs’ data in its weather forecasting products. The weather forecasting company used that opportunity to acquire a stake in Plume Labs. And now, AccuWeather is going one step further and acquiring the rest of the company.</p>
<p>“Air quality plays an intrinsic role in AccuWeather’s mission of saving lives and helping people prosper, and this acquisition will help us provide users and customers with an even more personalized experience as well as a 360-degree understanding of the impact of weather on their wellness,” AccuWeather president Steven R. Smith said in a statement. “Our exclusive alliance delivered on the promise to help put our users in greater control of their health, and we are committed to that goal even more firmly with this new strategic direction.”</p>
<p>Plume Labs will become the center for climate and environmental data for AccuWeather. This acquisition proves that air pollution is becoming a key metric for many industries.</p>
<p>“Seven years ago, David Lissmyr and I launched Plume Labs to make air quality information accessible to everyone,” Plume Labs co-founder and CEO Romain Lacombe said in a statement. “Since then, our work has helped galvanize the fight for clean air by making the health impact of climate change personal. Joining forces with AccuWeather now is an extraordinary opportunity to amplify our impact at planetary scale and help 1.5 billion people avoid air pollution around the world.”</p>
<p>Up next, the Plume Labs team and technology will continue to operate and expand its work to other environmental risks, such as wildfires. Climate risk forecasting is still in its early days, but today’s acquisition confirms that it is going to become more important over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years into the pandemic, online conversations are for many of us still the primary interactions that we are having every day, and we are collectively having billions of them. But as many of us have discovered, not all of those are squeaky clean, positive experiences. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum Labs</a> &#8212; which provides artificial intelligence technology to platform providers to detect and shut down toxic exchanges in real time (specifically, 20 milliseconds or less) &#8212; is announcing $32 million in funding. It plans to use the money to continue investing in its technology to double down on its growing consumer business and to forge ahead in a new area, providing services to enterprises for their internal and customer-facing conversations, providing not just a way to help detect when toxicity is creeping into exchanges, but to provide an audit trail for the activity for wider trust and safety tracking and initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aspire to be the leaders in language where civility matters,&#8221; CEO Justin Davis said in an interview.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Intel Capital, with Munich Re Ventures, Gaingels, OurCrowd, Harris Barton, and previous backers Wing Venture Capital, Greycroft, Ridge Ventures, Super{set}, and Global Founders Capital also participating. Greycroft led Spectrum&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous round of $10 million in September 2020</a>, and the company has now raised $46 million in total.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Davis, who co-founded the company with Josh Newman (the CTO), said Spectrum Labs is not disclosing valuation, but the company&#8217;s business size today speaks to how it&#8217;s been doing.</p>
<p>Spectrum Labs today works with just over 20 big platforms &#8212; they include social networking companies Pinterest and The Meet Group, dating site Grindr, Jimmy Wales&#8217; entertainment wiki Fandom, Riot Games, and e-learning platform Udemy &#8212; which in turn have millions of customers sending billions of messages to each other day, either in open chat rooms or in more direct, private conversations.</p>
<p>Its technology is based around natural language and works in real time both on text-based interactions and audio interactions.</p>
<p>Davis notes that its audio work is &#8220;read&#8221; as audio, not transcribed to text first, which gives Spectrum&#8217;s customers a significant jump on responding to the activity, and counteracting what Davis referred to as &#8220;The Wild West nature of voice,&#8221; due to how slow responses typically are for those not using Spectrum&#8217;s technology: a platform has to wait for users to flag iffy content, then the platform has to find that audio in the transcriptions, and then it can take action &#8212; a process that could take days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is all the more important since voice-based services &#8212; with the rise not just of podcasting but services like Clubhouse and Spaces on Twitter &#8212; are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Whether text or audio, Spectrum scans these exchanges for toxic content covering more than 40 behavior profiles that it built initially in consultation with researchers and academics around the world and continues to hone as it ingests more data from across the web. The profiles cover parameters like harassment, hate speech, violent extremism, scams, grooming, illegal solicitation and doxxing. It currently supports scanning in nearly 40 languages, Davis tells me, adding that it could work with any language, , although Davis tells me that there is no language limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can technically cover any language in a matter of weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The most visible examples of online toxicity have been in the consumer sphere &#8212; where they have played out in open-forum and more private online bullying and hate speech and other illegal activity, an area where Spectrum Labs will continue to do work and invest in technology to detect ever more complicated and sophisticated approaches from bad actors. One focus for Spectrum Labs will be in working on ways to improve how customers themselves can also play a role in deciding what they do and definitely do not want to see, alongside controls and tools for a platform&#8217;s trust and safety team. This is a tricky area, and arguably one reason why toxicity has gotten out of hand is because traditionally platforms have wanted to take a hands-off, free speech approach and not meddle in content, since the other side of the coin is that they can also be accused of censoring, a debate that is still very much playing out today.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a natural tension between what the policy implements and what users want and are willing to accept,&#8221; Davis said. His company&#8217;s view is that the job of a platform &#8220;is keeping the worst of the worst off, but also to provide consumer controls to make selection over what they want to see over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside that, Spectrum plans to move more into enterprise services.</p>
<p>The opportunity in enterprise is an interesting one, as it includes not just how people within a company converse with each other (which largely might take a similar form to the consumer-facing services that Spectrum Labs already provides), but also how a company interfaces with the outside world in areas like sales, customer service and marketing, and then leveraging the information that Spectrum Labs gathers in its analytics to potentially alter how each of those areas subsequently operates.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is not a market segment that has been ignored. Spectrum&#8217;s competitors here will include another startup in the conversation monitoring space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/aware-raises-60m-for-tech-that-monitors-internal-messaging-platforms-for-legal-compliance-sentiment-analysis-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aware</a>, which focuses on enterprise exclusively. (<a href="https://l1ght.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L1ght</a>, meanwhile, is another competitor in the consumer sphere.)</p>
<p>And there will certainly be others. We noted when we last wrote about Spectrum Labs that the founders and founding team came from Krux, a marketing technology company that was acquired by Salesforce (where they worked before leaving to found Spectrum Labs). I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Salesforce taking a more interested role in this area in the future, not least because it is building out a very wide toolset to help companies run their businesses more efficiently, not just limited to CRM; but also because Bret Taylor, who once founded another social network and used to be the CTO of Facebook, is now helping to run the show, and may well have an especially informed grip on how communications forums can be used and abused.</p>
<p>For now, to address both the consumer and enterprise issues, Intel is coming in as a strategic investor in this round, Davis tells me. The plan will be to integrate Spectrum Labs&#8217; technology to work more closely with Intel&#8217;s chip designs, which will increase the speed that it works even more, and Intel will be able to use as a unique selling point with Intel&#8217;s would-be hardware customers as they give a higher priority to trust and safety issues themselves.</p>
<p>“We believe Spectrum Labs’ Natural Language Understanding technology has the potential to become the core platform that powers the trust initiatives of thousands of companies around the world,” said Mark Rostick, VP and senior MD at Intel Capital, in a statement. “As digital trust and ethical operations emerge as a key factor to help organizations differentiate themselves, we see a huge opportunity to build a Trust &amp; Safety tech layer into enterprise operations.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiggy, India&#8217;s top food delivery startup, has raised $700 million in a new financing round, just six months after securing $1.25 billion, as it aggressively expands its offerings including the instant-delivery service in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Invesco led the Bengaluru-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series K round, which according to a source familiar with the matter values the seven year-old startup at $10.7 billion. Swiggy was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">valued at $5.5 billion in July last year</a>.</p>
<p>At a $10.7 billion valuation, Swiggy has surpassed the valuation of its 13-year-old chief rival Zomato, which went public last year and whose market cap has shrunk to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/23/paytm-zomato-nykaa-and-policybazaar-shares-drop-to-record-lows/">under $10 billion</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>New investors Baron Capital Group, Sumeru Venture, IIFL AMC Late Stake Tech Fund, Kotak, Axis Growth, Sixteenth Street Capital, Ghisallo, Smile Group, Segantii Capital as well as existing backers including Prosus Ventures, Alpha Wave Global, Qatar Investment Authority and ARK Impact also invested in the new round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in late September that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-10-billion-valuation/">Invesco was in talks to lead an investment of over $500 million</a> in Swiggy.</p>
<p>The new funding follows a strong year of growth for Swiggy in which the startup nearly doubled its food delivery business&#8217; gross order value, it said. Instamart, Swiggy&#8217;s instant delivery service, is set to reach an annual GMV run rate of $1 billion in the next three quarters, the startup said.</p>
<p>Instamart has become one of the major focus areas for Swiggy in the past year and a half.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which operates in over 500 Indian cities, said last year that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">plans to invest $700 million</a> to scale Instamart&#8217;s offerings and reach. The quick delivery space, which has made inroads in several markets in recent years, is becoming competitive in India, too.</p>
<p>Y Combinator Continuity Fund led the Mumbai-headquartered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/">10-minute-delivery service Zepto&#8217;s $100 million funding late last year.</a> Zomato-backed BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers), which like Swiggy is also backed by SoftBank, pivoted to instant delivery space last year.</p>
<p>“As long-term investors, the Invesco Developing Markets fund seeks investment opportunities in the best companies in the world, led by world-class management teams, and that have the potential for long-term structural growth,” said Justin Leverenz, Chief Investment Officer at Invesco Developing Markets Fund, said in a statement. “Our investment in Swiggy represents such an investment.”</p>
<p>Sriharsha Majety, co-founder and chief executive of Swiggy, said Instamart has reached a GMV in just 17 months what it took the core food delivery business 40 months to deliver.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make Swiggy the platform that 100 million consumers can use 15 times a month. We will continue to invest in our people, products, and partners to create a positive impact on the ecosystem and accelerate the digital transformation in food and grocery delivery and other on-demand services,” he added.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food services market, which is expected to reach $97 billion by March of 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients last year.</p>
<p>“India food services market is large and expected to reach $97 billion by FY25. Organized food service is growing faster and expected to reach 55% market share by FY25. We expect online penetration to expand to 20% by FY25 and market size to reach $20 billion growing at 46% CAGR. Significant part of the growth will be driven by new customer acquisition and penetration into smaller markets. Zomato had 10 million monthly transacting users (MTU) in FY20, expected to increase 5x by FY25 to ~50 million,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Amazon, a third player, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery space in India</a> in recent years, but, as a Zomato executive mentioned in a public forum last year, the American e-commerce group has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">yet to make inroads</a> in this category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ola Electric said on Monday it has raised $200 million in a new financing round even as the Indian ride-hailing giant&#8217;s spin off struggles to deliver its maiden electric scooter to customers and <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola">questions about its work culture have been raised</a>.</p>
<p>Tekne Private Ventures, Alpine Opportunity Fund, Edelweiss are among those was financed the new round, which values Ola Electric at $5 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">$3 billion in September last year</a>, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup said.</p>
<p>“I thank the investors for their support and look forward to partnering with them to take the EV revolution from India to the world,” Ola Electric co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said in a statement. The startup is looking to expand into more categories including cars, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ola Electric &#8212; which counts Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Global among its existing backers &#8212; last year announced its first electric scooter called Ola S1. Priced at about $1,350, the battery-powered scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge.</p>
<p>That’s more of a hypothetical / untested claim for most individuals as the startup has delayed the shipment of the scooter several times. And at best, only a tiny fraction of the customer base that had pre-ordered the vehicle has received it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bounce, a fellow Bengaluru-headquartered startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">unveiled its own electric scooter</a> that many analysts say promises to pack more than Ola’s offering.</p>
<p>Two-wheelers account for more than three-fourths of all vehicles sold in India. The push by startups as well large vehicle makers, coupled with favorable government incentives in recent years, are beginning to put India&#8217;s push to EV in the right direction. Analysts at UBS wrote in a report last week that they estimate 37% of all two-wheelers in India to be powered by electric by the end of the decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But for that projection to come true, plenty of factors need to play out the right way.</p>
<p>One of it could be the work culture at Ola, one of India&#8217;s largest startups. Ola and Ola Electric have also seen several key executive departures in recent months as a result of what Indian outlet Morning Context reported as <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola">toxic work culture and distrustful chief executive</a>. Aggarwal is also the co-founder and chief executive of Ola, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/indian-ride-hailing-startup-ola-valued-at-7-3-billion-in-new-funding/">raised capital at a valuation of $7.3 billion</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Paytm, Zomato, PolicyBazaar, and Nykaa &#8212; four Indian tech startups that went public last year &#8212; on Monday tumbled to their record lows since market debuts last year as analysts predict a global market correction amid US investors worrying about the prospect of high interest rates.</p>
<p>Shares of Paytm dropped over 6% to as low as ₹880 ($11.8) on Monday, the lowest since its public debut in mid-November. The market cap of mobile payments firm, which made its debut with an issue price of ₹2,150, has shrunk to $7.7 billion, less than half of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">$16 billion valuation at which it raised $1 billion</a> in a private financing round in the second half of 2019.</p>
<p>Nykaa shares dropped over 13% to ₹1,693 ($22.6) apiece, down from its all-time high of ₹2,574 ($34.5). At over 18.5% fall, shares of Zomato saw the steepest drop among the four aforementioned tech firms. The shares dropped to as low as ₹91.7 ($1.23) apiece from an all-time high of ₹169.10 ($2.27). PolicyBazaar fell over 9% to ₹766 ($10.2) apiece to nearly half of its all-time high of ₹1,470.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The recent tumble &#8212; which hasn&#8217;t impacted other Indian stocks as severely &#8212; comes as shares of tech companies that have rallied in recent years amid the pandemic begin to see what many analysts are terming as &#8220;correction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rally has also helped startups globally raise capital at record high valuation jumps and pace. But several investors are now publicly telling startups that those days are about to be over &#8212; for an indefinite period of time, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Market sentiment changes faster than startups can change operations, cost structures or monetization levers,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/singh_sequoia/status/1484449111273132034">said</a> Shailendra Singh, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital India, in a tweet last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking forward to a much needed correction in startup funding environment; thankfully, conversations are back to focusing on revenues, products, unit economics, saving dollars.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At an Axios conference last week, Rajeev Misra, chief executive of SoftBank Vision Fund, said that SaaS stocks in the US have gone down from 20 times of their revenue to 12x. &#8220;In the private markets they&#8217;re still at 20x or higher&#8230; I believe that gap is going to tighten over the next six months,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">says</a> global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year-over-year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, consumers are spending more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren&#8217;t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue, App Annie<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/"> noted</a>. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3><strong>Epic Games kicks off its appeal</strong></h3>
<p>Both Epic Games and Apple appealed the original ruling of the lawsuit where Epic had sought to prove Apple was behaving in an anti-competitive manner by not allowing alternative payments or other means of distributing apps outside the App Store. Although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">Apple largely won that case</a>, as the judge ruled it was not a monopolist, it was instructed to stop preventing app developers from adding links to third-party purchasing mechanisms &#8212; a decision it didn&#8217;t agree with, prompting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal</a>. Apple was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">given permission to hold off</a> on the App Store changes until the appeal&#8217;s ruling, in another blow to Epic. Meanwhile, Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the case since it wanted another shot at making its arguments before the court.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Epic Games filed its opening brief appealing the District Court&#8217;s decision in the Epic v. Apple case. In it, the company attempts to lay out why it thinks the District Court erred in its original decision, noting again how Apple reduces innovation, prevents alternative app stores from competing with its own, extracts &#8220;supracompetitive&#8221; commissions while making minimal investments in the App Store, and more. It also wants the appeals court to reconsider the market definitions for deciding the case. The lower court determined the case was about the &#8220;digital mobile game transactions&#8221; market, but Epic&#8217;s brief points out that Apple&#8217;s restrictions apply to both game and non-game developers alike. And it argues the court based its market definition on a misreading of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vs-epic-games-battle-experts-gets-personal-2021-05-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Amex</em></a>, by treating two separate transactions &#8212; consumers&#8217; app downloads on the App Store and the in-app purchase itself &#8212; as a single transaction.</p>

<h3><strong>OK, we&#8217;ll just call it a &#8220;platform fee&#8221; then  </strong></h3>
<p>When the Netherlands&#8217; regulator ordered Apple to allow dating apps on the App Store to be able to process third-party payments, it looked like it might be a small win for a more open ecosystem that would allow alternatives to Apple&#8217;s own payment systems and its commissions. But anyone celebrating this did so too soon. Apple has now clarified that while<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/apple-app-store-dutch-antitrust-order/"> it will adhere to the letter of the law</a>, by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering entitlements</a> to the dating apps looking to process payments on their own, it won&#8217;t adhere to the spirit. Not only will the developers have to publish a separate binary for their app they want it distributed to the Netherlands App Store, they&#8217;ll still have to pay Apple a commission on those third-party payments. And yet developers won&#8217;t be able to take advantage of any platform advantages, like getting Apple to assist with refunds, payment history, subscription management or other issues related to the purchases &#8212; as those will now take place outside its App Store. So what&#8217;s the platform fee for? I guess access to users?</p>
<p>Wrote Apple on its developer documentation page: &#8220;Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions.&#8221; But Apple didn&#8217;t say how much that commission will be. Likely, Apple will take the course that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google did in South Korea</a>, where it dropped the commission rate for external payments by a mere 4%.</p>
<h3>Twitter gets into NFTs</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s official, Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/twitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature/">embraced NFTs</a>. Users on Twitter&#8217;s iOS app who also subscribe to Twitter Blue will be the first to take advantage of a new feature that lets them authenticate with their crypto wallet to use an NFT as their profile pic on the service. The new NFT hexagon-shaped pics will help to differentiate the crypto-enthusiasts from the rest of Twitter.</p>
<p>To use the feature as a Twitter Blue subscriber, you’ll go to your profile to change your profile photo as you would normally. Here, you’ll be presented with the new option to choose an NFT instead. You then connect with your crypto wallet.</p>
<p>At launch, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, MetaMask, Ledger Live, Argent and Trust Wallet are supported. After authenticating, you’ll select the NFT you want to showcase. Twitter says that, currently, JPEG and PNG NFTs minted on the Ethereum (ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens) can be used as NFT Profile Pictures. In a later <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1484315142875615236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1484315142875615236%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2022%2F01%2F20%2Ftwitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>, Twitter said it was looking into adding support for SVGs, but can’t render them right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting the Twitter Blue subscription service is not yet globally available, which will limit the adoption of NFT Profile Pictures to the early markets where the offering is now live — the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the update, which is <a href="https://observer.com/2022/01/twitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving mixed reactions</a>. Some people are trolling the hexa-profiles, others are blocking people and <a href="https://twitter.com/CirenSong/status/1484301800048152576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1484301800048152576%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fobserver.com%2F2022%2F01%2Ftwitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mye_Bi/status/1483211676640026626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1483211676640026626%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fobserver.com%2F2022%2F01%2Ftwitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions%2F">artists</a> claim the feature has encouraged more people to steal their art and mint it as an NFT (which to be fair, could have happened before).</p>

<li><strong>Google Play Games for PC enters beta testing.</strong> The downloadable app, which brings Android games to Windows PC users, is launching to beta testers in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan.

<h3><strong>E-commerce/Food delivery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok kids are boosting toy retailer Learning Express&#8217; sales. </strong>The company&#8217;s online sales increased 25% in 2021, compared with massive 233% growth in 2020, amid the pandemic. Interestingly, the retailer hasn&#8217;t spent money on TikTok marketing and advertising, noting that kids are starting to find them on their own. Over the past years, the TikTok toy trends have turned toys into viral hits like Pop Its, Squishmallow, fidget spinners and more, thanks to kids sharing videos on the social app. The retailer, where individual stores are franchises, is also benefitting from some of its owners&#8217; own TikTok presence &#8212; like the Birmingham location, which has 2.3 million followers and its most popular video received 62 million views.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers may be swapping food delivery apps for grocery delivery,</strong> <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/grocery-apps-gain-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia research shows</a>. Food delivery apps in Q2 2021 saw total sessions fall 10% from March, and the rest of the year showed no real gains. Meanwhile, in December, grocery delivery apps posted a 20% increase in downloads from the month prior. And DoorDash and Uber Eats adapted, the former by adding grocery and convenience stores to its app, and the latter by removing the word &#8220;restaurant&#8221; from its app&#8217;s title.</li>

Users will be able to trade 1,100 securities, including shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, as well as gain access to 200 ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>Investing app Acorns <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/investing-app-acorns-pioneer-spac-scrap-22-bln-merger-2022-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrapped its $2.2 billion merger</a> agreement with SPAC Pioneer Merger Corp.</strong> The deal, announced last May, would have allowed Acorns to list on the Nasdaq, and the merger was valued at $1.5 billion pre-money. Acorns will pay $17.5 million in termination fees through December 15. The company said that &#8220;given market conditions,&#8221; it was pivoting to a private capital raise at a higher pre-money valuation instead.</li>

<li><strong>Instagram also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/instagram-now-allows-creators-to-remix-any-public-videos-not-just-reels/">launched</a> an expanded version of &#8220;remix,</strong>&#8221; which now allows anyone to remix any public video on the platform going forward, unless the creators opt out.</li>
<li><strong>Snapchat is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/snapchat-fentanyl-opioid-crisis-update/">trying to make it harder</a> for kids to buy drugs on the app</strong> after an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation</a> found the app was linked to the sale of fentanyl-laced pills that led to the deaths of teenagers and young adults in over a dozen states. The app now prevents 13 to 17-year-old users from showing up in Quick Add search results, unless they have friends in common with the person searching &#8212; a feature aimed at preventing users from adding people they don&#8217;t know to deter drug transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook and Instagram are working on NFT features that will allow users to display their NFTs on their social profiles.</strong> Instagram head Adam Mosseri had previously said the company was looking into NFT support. This week, a report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The FT added</a> Meta is considering its own NFT marketplace, but noted the efforts were in early stages. This is not entirely <em>new</em> information, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Mosseri had said the company was considering a marketplace</a>. It has also invited NFT artists to offer feedback through panel discussions, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacksonweimer/2021/05/22/instagram-is-looking-to-create-an-nft-platform-but-is-overlooking-artists/?sh=32e7fbfa2eb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which was discussed in the press last year</a> when some artists were upset about being asked to advise the social giant on the matter without compensation. But the report indicates the investment may extend to Facebook as well.</li>

<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spotify is still the top streaming music service but its market share has slipped a bit,</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/spotify-subscription-numbers-up-youtube-music-tidal/">according to new research</a> from MIDiA, as the streaming market has grown. In Q2 2021, 523.9 million people subscribed to a music streaming service globally, up 26.4% from the same time last year. Spotify&#8217;s market share, meanwhile, dropped from 34% in 2019 to 31% today, followed by Apple, then Amazon Music. YouTube Music grew by more than 50% year-over-year, making it the only Western streamer to have increased market share.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/13/youtube-smart-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">app is testing &#8220;smart downloads</a>,&#8221;</strong> a feature that automatically downloads videos when an Android device is connected to Wi-Fi, in order to be ready when there&#8217;s either weak coverage or no signal at a later point. The feature is already supported in YouTube Music.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-on-ios-and-android/">expanded its growing gaming lineup</a> this week with the launch of two more games:</strong> Arcanium: Rise of Akhan, an open-world single-player card strategy game developed by Rogue Games; and puzzle game Krispee Street developed by Frosty Pop. The additions bring Netflix&#8217;s gaming catalog to 12 titles, including Bowling Ballers, Shooting Hoops, Teeter Up, Asphalt Xtreme, Stranger Things 1984, Stranger Things 3, Card Blast, Dominos Cafe, Wonderputt Forever and Knittens.</li>
<li><strong>During its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/netflix-q4-2021-results-subscriber-numbers/">less-than-stellar earnings</a>, Netflix&#8217;s COO Greg Peters also <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflix-video-games-stranger-things-1235159017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the company is open to licensing &#8220;large game IP&#8221;</a> </strong>that people would recognize as it expands its gaming business. &#8220;I think you will [see] some of that happen over the year to come,&#8221; Peters noted.</li>
<li><strong>In addition to the major news of Microsoft&#8217;s Activision Blizzard deal, the company also announced this week that its Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service has grown to</a> 25 million subscribers</strong>, up from 18 million in January 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Wordle!, an iOS game that existed before the rise of the popular web-based game by the same name, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886523/wordle-wardle-app-donate-charity-popularity-spike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefitted from the latter&#8217;s popularity</a> leading to a surge in downloads.</strong> The developer, Steven Cravotta, hadn&#8217;t been updating the game, which first launched in 2017 but never really took off, until it jumped to 200,000 downloads per week from those likely looking for the other Wordle game. So Cravotta reached out to Wordle&#8217;s developer (Josh Wardle) to note he was donating the proceeds to charity, which has totaled $2,000+ so far.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. consumer spending in mobile action games jumped up 68.9% in 2021, driven by almost entirely Genshin Impact,</strong> <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/mobile-game-genre-growth-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Sensor Tower. Spending for the year reached $966.8 million, making Action the fastest-rising gaming genre and Open World Adventure the largest Action subgenre. MiHoYo&#8217;s Genshin Impact earned $406.3 million in the U.S. in 2021, followed by Marvel Contest of Champions by Kabam and Dragon Ball Legends from Bandai Namco.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile gamers who use TikTok play for longer, play more genres and spend more money,</strong> according to <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/opportunity-mobile-gamers-who-use-tiktok-play-for-longer-play-more-genres-and-spend-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report from NewZoo.</a> TikTok gamers are 66% more likely to pay for games, and are 40% more likely to pay for add-ons. They&#8217;re also more likely to watch gaming content, often on TikTok. The group also tends to use social platforms to find new games (45% versus 32% for those who don’t use TikTok). They play on average 7.1 genres versus 4.2 genres for non-TikTok users, and are more likely to notice ad types.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Read-it-later app Instapaper on iOS <a href="https://blog.instapaper.com/post/673906371094364160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> new features,</strong> including public folders, which allow users to share their saved reading lists with others via web or mobile. The app also added custom app icons in a variety of neutral tones for its premium users, and a &#8220;read now&#8221; feature for web users that lets you click the Instapaper logo immediately after saving an article to read it immediately. The company said it can&#8217;t offer the feature on iOS due to technical limitations.</li>

<h3><strong>Health &amp; Fitness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MY2022, an app mandated for use by all attendees of the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/01/cross-country-exposure-analysis-my2022-olympics-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was found to have technical flaws</a> </strong>allowing encryption to be sidestepped, according to The Citizen Lab&#8217;s research.

<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>

<p>AngelList’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">recently closed early-stage venture fund </a>brings back one of my favorite conversations within the world of early-stage startup fundraising: to data, or not to data. The $25 million fund bases all of its investments off of one key metric that AngelList has been tracking for years: a startup’s ability to hire.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Abraham Othman, head of the investment committee and of data science at AngelList Venture, he told me they win deals because they are less adversarial to portfolio companies than other firms. “Our approach? This is our data set, let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said. No further due diligence? No problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260781" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, there are some challenges with leaning on such signals to make investments. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-startup-friends/">As history often reminds us</a>, due diligence matters from a human perspective — and vetting a founder beyond their ability to attract talent can save firms from headaches or legal woes. Additionally, a startup could get a ton of applicants due to pay, location or even recent coverage in a Well Known Tech Blog — which can bode well for success, but could also just be a result of great marketing. In AngelList’s case, they believe that hiring demand’s fluidity adds to its importance.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I think the future of data-driven investments will bring a double-edged sword into our Zoom rooms (or lack thereof, perhaps). Traditional investment that prioritizes pedigree and culture, or the “art” of a founder, has left out an entire class of historically overlooked individuals. But that same process, in which you spend five hours in conversation with an aspiring entrepreneur, brings a layer of humanity to decision-makers before they get millions to execute on a vision.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get into the due diligence conversation yet again, and investors leaning on data to dictate their investment decisions is anything but a new strategy. This is the song of late-stage investors, of private equity analysts and your brilliant aunt who loves a good earnings report. Early-stage startups and investors, from ClearCo to SignalFire, have spent years building up advice atop algorithms atop assumed returns.</p>
<p>However, in a bull market for even the most bullish among us, the premise of an unbiased, data-based check feels somewhat more hopeful than before. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">Money certainly doesn’t solve all woes</a> &#8212; the top reason startups fail today is <em>still </em>due to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure to raise new capital</a>. Add in the gender fundraising gap and a more automated decision-making process suddenly doesn’t sound unromantic, it sounds inevitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about a new graduate-friendly fund, lawyer tech and Plaid’s growing patchwork of startups. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@nmasc_</a> or listen to me on Equity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/how-many-unicorns-are-just-pinatas-filled-with-expired-candy/">a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</a></p>
<h2><strong>$1 million lasts a million times longer than before </strong></h2>
<p>Led by Flybridge founding partner Jeff Bussgang, Harvard Business School professors put together a $7 million fund to invest in recently graduated students from the university. This is the third installment of the Graduate Syndicate, which officially <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1895183/000189518322000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed this week per SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The syndicate started a few years ago when business school professors realized that young talent within their classes was looking for activation capital. To limit conflict of interest, such as favoritism or power imbalance, Bussgang said that the syndicate only invests in founders after they graduate from school. So far, the syndicate has invested in 60 companies, with 41% of them being led or co-led by a female founder.</p>
<p><em>Bussgang on what changed in pre-seed: </em></p>
<blockquote><p>A pre-seed round, which is typically around a million dollars, is happening in a moment in time where you can make a ton of progress with just a million dollars, given the no-code, low code platforms, the cloud and reduction in costs for starting things up. The biggest trend I&#8217;ve seen is that these companies can just do so much with so little [and] because of these no code platforms…business founders can be builders, they don&#8217;t have to be software developers and that&#8217;s a great tailwind for the HBS community.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>And the startup of the week is…</strong></h2>
<p>Lawtrades. When it comes to our newly distributed world of work, flexibility is a key but elusive term. Lucky for Raad Ahmed and Ashish Walia, the co-founders of Lawtrades, defining the term has been a conversation that’s been in the works since 2016. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/lawtrades-aims-to-change-how-your-company-utilizes-legal-resources/">Lawtrades wants to change how enterprise companies utilize legal resources</a>,and give lawyers a chance at more flexible, remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The startup raised a $6 million Series A round, led by Four Cities Capital, with participation from Draper Associates and 500 Startups. More than $11 million was earned on the platform to date by the lawyer network and over 60,000 hours of work was logged on the platform in 2021, a 200% boost from 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/lawtrades-aims-to-change-how-your-company-utilizes-legal-resources/">our own Christine Hall reports. </a></p>
<p><em>Ahmed on the moonshot:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>As a company, you&#8217;re basically meeting internet strangers and hiring them for hundreds of thousands of dollars and trusting that they’re going to do a good job. So there’s a solid amount of betting that happens on the supply side. We let about 5% to 6% of [lawyers into the platform] &#8211; but the actual hard part is how does this day look operationally? Other platforms…there isn’t a lot of work transparency, so that’s what we’re trying to work on.</p>
<p>We have this simple tool, a time tracking app, once you get hired for an engagement, you&#8217;re basically logging in every hour of work. We basically make this transparent to clients so they see what&#8217;s the equivalent of a Facebook newsfeed but it&#8217;s a work feed. So it updates on who&#8217;s working on what or how long, what project and you can react to that, comment on it and we&#8217;re coming up with more and more clever ways for us to sort of capture the data with minimal work from like our network of lawyers.</p>
<p>It actually allows you to gain even more transparency and even more detail into someone&#8217;s productivity than you would if you were side by side right.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Plaid went in on Cognito </strong></h2>
<p>Fintech giant Plaid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">acquired verification platform Cognito for around $250 million</a>, TC’s Alex Wilhelm reported this week. Plaid has been actively growing from the fabric that helps fintechs communicate, to a patchwork of services built atop those key connections.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The deal comes months after Plaid’s own acquisition, which would have seen it be owned by Visa, fell apart and landed it a lofty new valuation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/wordles-blizzard-of-transparency/">As we spoke about on the latest Equity</a>, Plaid has matured to host a growing startup accelerator, acquire companies and clearly expand its strategic ambitions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Excerpt: Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday?

<p>Hello friends, I hope you are well and warm and healthy and happy and good. If not, some of those things. If you are none, well there’s a reason we invented ice cream.</p>
<p>In good news I have a few tasty nuggets for you this fine Saturday. We’re talking the metaverse, a venture capital story that I’ve watched from its genesis, and a funding round for a very cool startup that I accidentally blanked this week, so we’re talking about it here. Ready? Let’s have some fun.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260866" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The most fun that I had this week was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1484180969057710084">a visit to Decentraland</a>. In short, I was in edit and trying to distract myself so that I wouldn’t bother the editing team while they worked, so I fired up the social-crypto environment – metaverse, in other words – and went for a tour. Rocking a mohawk and some pretty cool pants I managed to get lost, visit an NFT gallery, and fail to gain access to an arena.</p>
<p>Look, the metaverse as it exists today looks a lot like Runescape. That’s not that big a diss, given the sheer historical footprint that the online RPG has built for itself. But what I don’t really need is a less featured MMORPG that includes, oddly, a more financial angle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/despite-blockchain-gamings-play-to-earn-angle-i-prefer-to-pay/">than I tend to like in my games</a>.</p>
<p>I am neutral at the moment, and open to the metaverse becoming sufficiently cool that I log in daily. But today it seems that some Web 2.0 properties that include community creation and social interaction are superior to what we’ve yet seen from the crypto team.</p>

<h2>Amplify’s newest general partner</h2>
<p>Roughly 1,000 years ago, a startup named Mattermark hired me to build an independent news room for their company. It was a great learning experience, frankly, and had the added edge of introducing me to some lifetime friends. <a href="https://twitter.com/ckevinliu?lang=en">Kevin Liu now of TechStars</a>, for example.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahcat21">Sarah Catanzaro</a> was another standout from the Mattermark team. Her work on the company’s data team was later translated into work in venture, first at <a href="https://www.canvas.vc/">Canvas Ventures</a>, and later <a href="https://amplifypartners.com/">Amplify Partners</a>. Amplify, for reference, last <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/amplify-partners-raised-amplify-partners-iv--ade45263">announced a fund in late 2020</a> worth $275 million. Given that timeframe, I expect the group to announce a new capital vehicle in short order.</p>
<p>At Amplify, Catanzaro went from principal, to partner, to, most recently, general partner. Her journey from the lowest ranks of the VC world to its top-tier has been enjoyable to watch. And, she told TechCrunch during a call the other week, she’s the first woman to reach her level at Amplify. I highlight that to remind myself that promotions in the yet-cottage industry of venture capital are unlike startup level gains in their pace.</p>
<p>Regardless, Catanzaro told us something that I wanted to write down here, so that we can circle back to it later on. We discussed her firm’s investment approach, check size targets, and how often they enter companies at seed versus Series A maturity levels. Per the newly minted GP, Series A rounds have gotten much bigger <em>without</em> a commensurate decrease in risk. This is something that I have had as a hunch for some time, but hadn’t heard someone say out loud before.</p>
<p>This means that Series A risk, from a venture perspective, is going up as more capital is put to work at the startup stage. The math could work out in the end, provided that enough mega-exits are made in the coming years. But with the market in free-fall, and Concern now getting more column inches than Unbridled Enthusiasm, well, I wonder a bit.</p>
<h2>The pride of Rhode Island</h2>
<p>Living as I do in the Ocean State, I am slightly afield from the best-known technology hubs in the United States. But that doesn’t mean that fascinating tech companies are being built here in my small state. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/student-labor-marketplace-pangea-closes-2m-seed-round/">has spilt ink</a>, to pick an example, on <a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, a startup founded in Providence that is building a freelance labor marketplace for college kids.</p>
<p>Another startup in Lil Rhody is <a href="https://dockwa.com/">The Wanderlust Group</a>, which has built Dockwa, a software platform for marinas and boaters. In short, the world of managing boat slip reservations was stuck floating in the world of pen and paper, and Wanderlust decided to to modernize it through software.</p>
<p>We last touched on the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/the-wanderlust-group-raises-14-2m-to-double-down-on-getting-folks-outdoors/">in 2020 when it raised $14.2 million</a>. At that time, CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mdmelillo">Mike Melillo</a> told TechCrunch that his company had merely been on the hunt for $7 million, a figure that it doubled.</p>
<p>So I was not surprised to hear from the company recently that it has raised again. This time Wanderlust has raised a $30 million Series C at a $150 million pre-money valuation. The funding event was led by <a href="https://www.thursday.vc/">Thursday Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Happily for you and I, Wanderlust was willing to share ARR growth for 2021, which came in at 71%. More fun, after moving to a four-day workweek, the company saw its ARR expand 100% from June 2020 to June 2021; there’s a real datapoint for one of the more interesting labor experiments I am tracking in startup-land.</p>
<p>But most interesting from the company is that it’s building a fund. Not another corporate venture capital fund, but something else. Called Wanderfund, the company is funding the vehicle with $300,000 this year for what it describes as “environmental causes at the national and local level.” It’s starting, in part, with putting money in its local Boys &amp; Girls Club to help kids get out of the house and into nature.</p>
<p>The company is building a Dockwa-like product for camping, so the “go outside” theme is pretty core to what the aptly named <em>Wanderlust</em> Group is building.</p>
<h2>Miscellania and Various</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/investing-app-acorns-pioneer-spac-scrap-22-bln-merger-2022-01-18/">Acorns SPAC deal is off</a>, which caught our eye. It’s not a huge shock given how poor some SPACs have performed post-combination, but we had honestly been looking forward to Acorns as a public company.</li>
<li>Acorns S-1, please.</li>
<li>And the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-adds-feature-letting-users-pose-questions-to-tesla-coinbase-2022-1">Robinhood experiment</a> with making the financial market more open to regular folks through IPO access and corporate democracy has good sides, and <a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/robinhood-and-ipo-access">sharper edges worth keeping in mind</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok that’s enough for now. Chat you all next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2021 will be remembered as the year that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/"> ransomware</a> gangs turned their attention to critical infrastructure, targeting companies built around manufacturing, energy distribution, and food production.</p>
<p>The Colonial Pipeline ransomware alone resulted in the shutdown of 5,500 miles of pipeline over fears that the ransomware attack on its IT network would spread to the operational network that controls the pipeline for distributing fuel.</p>
<p>Operational technology (OT) networks control the devices critical to the continued operations of production lines, power plants, and energy supplies, and as such are typically segmented from a company&#8217;s internet-facing IT networks to better isolate critical hardware from cyberattacks. Successful attacks against OT networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/triton-malware-strike/">are rare</a>, but in the wake of the Colonial ransomware attack, CISA warned of a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-threat-to-ot">growing threat</a> for critical infrastructure owners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now security researchers are warning of the risks posed by the embedded devices that sit on those OT networks. Red Balloon Security, a security provider for embedded devices, found in new research that it&#8217;s <a href="https://redballoonsecurity.com/ransomware-installation-on-embedded-devices-is-possible-because-weve-done-it/index.html">possible to deploy ransomware</a> on embedded systems that are used in real-world networks.</p>
<p>The company said it found vulnerabilities in the Schneider Electric Easergy P5 protection relay, a device that&#8217;s key to the operation and stability of the modern electric grids by triggering circuit breakers if a fault is discovered.</p>
<p>This vulnerability could be exploited to deploy a ransomware payload, a “sophisticated but reproducible” process that Red Balloon said it achieved. A Schneider Electric spokesperson told TechCrunch &#8220;it is extremely vigilant of cyber threats,&#8221; and that &#8220;upon learning of the vulnerabilities with the Schneider Electric Easergy P5 protection relay, we worked immediately to resolve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ang Cui, founder and co-CEO of Red Balloon told TechCrunch that while ransomware attacks have hit IT networks of critical infrastructure providers, a successful compromise of an OT embedded device can be &#8220;far more damaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Companies are not used to or experienced in recovering from an attack on the embedded devices themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the device is destroyed or made unrecoverable, then a replacement device needs to be sourced, and this can take weeks as there is a limited supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security veteran Window Snyder, who last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/thistle-technology-seed-security-iot/"> launched a startup to help IoT manufacturers reliably and securely deliver software updates</a> to their devices, said that embedded devices could become an easy target, particularly as other points of entry become more resilient.</p>
<p>Speaking of embedded systems: “A lot of them don’t have separation of privilege on them, a lot of them don’t have separation between code and data, and a lot of them were developed with the idea that they’d be sitting on air-gapped networks — it’s insufficient,” Snyder told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Red Balloon says its research demonstrates that the security built into these devices — many are several decades old — needs to be improved, and is calling for end-users in government and commercial sectors to call for higher standards from the vendors who make those devices.</p>
<p>“Issuing firmware fixes is a reactive, inefficient approach that will not address the overall insecurity of our most mission-critical industries and services,” says Cui. “Vendors need to bring more security down to the embedded device level.” He also believes also that more work needs to be done by the U.S. government on a regulation level, and thinks more pressure needs to be put onto device manufacturers who currently aren’t incentivized to build in more security at a device level.</p>
<p>Snyder, however, thinks a regulation-led approach is unlikely to help: “I think the thing that helps most is reducing the attack surface and increasing compartmentalization,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We’re not going to regulate our way out of more secure devices. Somebody has to go out there and build resilience into them.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past two years have been exciting periods of growth for the cloud market, driven by increased demand for access to new technology during COVID-19 and the proliferation of the “work-from-anywhere” culture. IT leaders worked to shift workloads to the cloud to ensure business continuity for the remote workforce, leading to skyrocketing adoption of cloud computing. This momentum is expected to pick up in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p>For many businesses, the pandemic accelerated their digital transformation plans by months, or even years. Reliance on cloud infrastructure will only continue to grow as organizations adjust to the hybrid work model. Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-02-gartner-says-four-trends-are-shaping-the-future-of-public-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projects</a> that global spending on cloud services is expected to reach over $482 billion in 2022, up from $313 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>As we start the new year, C2C, an independent Google Cloud community, has identified six cloud computing trends to watch in 2022.</p>
<h2>More people are harnessing new technologies</h2>
<p>The pandemic inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs. Whether out of necessity from mass layoffs, a desire for a more flexible lifestyle, or finding the inspiration to finally pursue a passion, millions have started their own ventures.</p>
<p>As their businesses grow and digitize, entrepreneurs across industries are embracing the cloud and adopting technologies like machine learning and data analytics to optimize business performance, save time and cut expenses. There are countless benefits to small businesses and startups. For one, the cloud makes data accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling the seamless collaboration necessary in a hybrid work environment. Without having to spend on expensive hardware and software, entrepreneurs can invest in other areas as they scale their businesses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In algorithmic investing, investors use a company’s metrics to decide whether to participate in a deal. But when the art of choice is factored out, it becomes more difficult to perform deep due diligence on founders who may be about to receive millions of dollars via a wire transfer.</p>
<p>In practice, attempts to remove bias can create newer, blind spots that are harder to identify.</p>
<p>In theory, algorithmic investing hedges against investors&#8217; preconceived notions and pushes emotions to the side. Fintech unicorn Clearco and venture firm SignalFire have spent years implementing data-focused investment processes, joined more recently by AngelList and Hum Capital. While this approach isn’t new, the movement against solely emotion-based decisions feels louder given the proliferation of dollars out there.</p>
<p>Metrics, even in the earliest stages, are becoming more mainstream.</p>
<p>AngelList’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">recently closed early-stage venture fund </a>is basing all of its investments off of one key metric that AngelList has been tracking for years: a startup’s ability to hire.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Abraham Othman, head of the investment committee and data science at AngelList Venture, he told me they win deals because they are less adversarial to portfolio companies than other firms.“Our approach? This is our data set &#8212; let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said.</p>
<p>No further due diligence? No problem.</p>
<p>It’s no small set. About 2 million individuals use AngelList Talent to apply to startups each quarter. About 35,000 companies per quarter are contenders for AngelList talent, but only half of those companies are investable early-stage businesses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You have to begin somewhere. When Jayce Hafner and Sami Tellatin bonded as Stanford MBA classmates over their shared belief that helping U.S. farms run more efficiently would be good for the country and a great business, they decided to start with grants.</p>
<p>For her part, Hafner grew up on a cattle ranch in Virginia and knew firsthand that applying for grants &#8212; even to improve the sustainable farming practices of her family&#8217;s farm &#8212; was a confusing and time-intensive process. As for Tellatin, she studied biological engineering as an undergrad and spent three years with the USDA, researching farm economics. She knew, too, that farmers might make better choices if grants were more available to them.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://farmraise.com">FarmRaise</a>, a now 12-person, two-year-old, San Diego, Ca.-based company that has made considerable progress since the two joined forces with another cofounder, Albert Abedi, who they met through the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/check-out-these-startups-from-pears-demo-day-theres-usually-a-breakout-or-two-in-the-bunch/">accelerator program</a> of Pear VC, the Palo Alto-based firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Hafner, the company already has nearly 10,000 farms on the platform thanks to word of mouth, a dash of search-engine magic, and, importantly, partnerships it has struck with agriculture giants like Cargill and Corteva (spun out of DuPont in 2018) that have carbon emission reduction goals to meet and have begun directing farmers to FarmRaise for help with grants tied to low-carbon farming.</p>
<p>FarmRaise&#8217;s platform &#8212; which asks for granular farm insights, then structures the data in a way that allows FarmRaise to quickly apply for a wide variety of grant programs on its customers&#8217; behalf &#8211; also has enough momentum that investors are now in the mix. The team just landed $7.2 million in seed funding led by Susa Ventures.</p>
<p>Still, as with so many startups, Hafner says grants &#8212; both federal and private &#8212; are just the starting point for the very broad financial services company that FarmRaise intends to become. Imagine, suggests Hafner, that once a farm has provided much of its data to the company, that FarmRaise can help it land loans, secure equipment at bulk prices, and help with the farm&#8217;s tax planning.</p>
<p>Many of these services will be provided through third parties, she says, with FarmRaise collecting finders&#8217; fees. FarmRaise isn&#8217;t looking to reinvent the wheel. But there&#8217;s also no reason that farmers shouldn&#8217;t have a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; resource to which to turn, she adds. Besides, other services can keep customers satisfied while they wait to learn whether or not they landed a grant, some of which have wait times of six to 12 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grants are &#8220;our wedge,&#8221; Hafner says. &#8220;They are not the end of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, FarmRaise is focused on hiring more employees, lining up more grants, and making sure its customers are happy with the services it provides currently and for which it charges a monthly subscription, along with 10% of the value of the grants it secures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to get right. Grants are a big opportunity, suggests Hafner, including because USDA funding has &#8220;been growing like crazy,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She points to the Trump administration, which distributed &#8220;tens of billions of dollars&#8221; in funding to support farmers who struggled with Covid-related supply-chain disruptions.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also has FarmRaise feeling encouraged, she adds, &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing this keen focus on growing the size of the pie for conservation funding and it likely doubling in the years to come.&#8221; It only makes sense, she suggests. &#8220;Not only does [sustainable farming] increase farm profitability but it also sequesters carbon and can help to address climate change. They are just many, many, many benefits that come with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other participants in the company&#8217;s seed round include Cendana Capital, Ulu Ventures, Pear, Better Tomorrow Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Financial Ventures Studio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google filed a motion Friday asking a federal court to dismiss most of the counts in an antitrust lawsuit led by the state of Texas. In the filing, the company argued that the Texas lawsuit isn&#8217;t &#8220;credible&#8221; and that the state failed to establish that the company&#8217;s ad business has run afoul of antitrust laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;AG Paxton&#8217;s allegations are more heat than light, and we don&#8217;t believe they meet the legal standard to send this case to trial,&#8221; Google Director of Economic Policy Adam Cohen <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the suit, which alleges that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in online advertising, in late 2020. Texas <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/14/facebook-google-ad-market-lawsuit-527108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated the suit with a new complaint</a> last week that was first filed in November but redacted at the time, before a judge ordered the details of the complaint to be made public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Kentucky and Puerto Rico have also joined the lawsuit seeking to hold the tech giant accountable.</p>

<p>Google claims that Paxton &#8220;overlooks, or misstates, a litany of clear facts,&#8221; including allegations that the company made a deal with Facebook to maintain its online ad dominance by crushing an emerging ad buying process called &#8220;header bidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/technology/google-facebook-ad-deal-antitrust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting from The New York Times</a>, Facebook announced the relationship in 2018 but did not disclose that Google granted its competitor &#8220;special information and speed advantages to help the company succeed in the auctions that it did not offer to other partners — even including a guaranteed &#8216;win rate.'&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mired in its own antitrust woes, Meta similarly asked the court to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/lawsuit-aiming-to-break-up-facebook-group-meta-can-go-ahead-us-court-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismiss an antitrust lawsuit</a> that could force the company to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, but a judge ruled earlier this month that the FTC&#8217;s refiled suit would be allowed to proceed.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency and blockchain had a breakout year in 2021.</p>
<p>ust look at the numbers: 80 million unique crypto wallets; Bitcoin and Ether grew 60% and 407%, respectively; El Salvador adopted bitcoin as official currency; the NFT market generated $2.5 billion in trades. Even Burger King announced a whopper when they got in on the NFT action. Impressive? Absolutely. Have we reached a point where crypto and blockchain reach mass adoption? Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Even though DeFi, cryptocurrencies, blockchains, NFTs and a slew of other products came online in 2021, only about 1% of the world’s population has a unique crypto wallet. Media coverage, financial institutions, and companies with hefty marketing budgets jumped in and made it seem as if mass adoption was already here. But in reality, we’re not there yet.</p>
<p>However, we anticipate that changing in 2022. From more creative crypto entries to the impact of inflation and new technologies, here are five trends we expect in 2022, and what you can do to navigate the challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>Expect more diverse uses for crypto</h2>
<p>For the most part, consumers are aware that crypto exists, but they don’t understand its benefits in their day-to-day lives. For many, it’s seen as an investment tool for institutional or retail investors, a novelty, or something that caters primarily to the trendiest of the Gen Z crowd. With blockchain games and GameFi, as well as reward redemption platforms that trade airline miles into crypto on the horizon, expect this to change in 2022.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of this already in 2021 with NFTs that cater to art collectors and sports enthusiasts. We&#8217;ll see it branch out into other areas such as wine, sneakers and other collectibles, bringing in new users.</p>
<p>For the mass consumer, understanding these technologies can be challenging, but when NFTs are tied to something they know and are enthusiastic about, it’ll start growing among that community. Keep an eye on enterprising companies pushing into these areas – specifically collectibles – as a way to broaden the reach of crypto and blockchain in 2022.</p>
<h2>A surge in crypto apps</h2>
<p>Crypto is considered technically complicated to hold, and for the layperson, even the terminology is difficult to understand. Crypto and blockchain need to be easy to use and understand before mass adoption can happen, and that’s what we’ll see in 2022.</p>
<p>Cheaper blockchains are allowing new users to onboard with DApps, which are decentralized applications that run on a P2P or blockchain network. They don’t require users to submit their personal information. It’ll start with global digital asset payments, recurring buys, or tipping, but will grow to include multiple types of transactions, which will only increase user adoption.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 21, 2022! I normally try to bring some pep to my little intros in this missive. But today I am going to avoid astroturfing my own mood to simply say, hey, what&#8217;s up with the stock market? After a period of time when things only went up, have we flipped the coin? I am not going to say that I love it, but hey, at least it’s the weekend. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/activision-blizzard-union-raven-software/">Is Microsoft buying a union?</a> </strong>Raven Software’s quality assurance department is forming a union at Activision Blizzard. TechCrunch called the move the “first union to form at a major U.S. gaming company.” Given that Microsoft is supposed to buy Raven Software’s parent company, the union situation has an even more interesting flavor than most tech union news that we’ve seen lately.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/vcs-approached-facebook-to-fund-a-spinout-of-workplace-valued-at-over-1b-but-facebook-declined/">VCs wanted to spin-out Facebook’s Slack competitor</a>:</strong> Facebook’s internal work tool that it turned into a product won’t be leaving the confines of the Meta corporation. TechCrunch learned that VCs wanted the social giant to spin it out at a valuation north of $1 billion, but Team Zuck didn’t bite.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/netflixs-dismal-results-are-more-evidence-that-the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">Netflix’s poor results prove the pandemic trade is over</a>:</strong> After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/netflix-q4-2021-results-subscriber-numbers/">reporting numbers</a> that left Wall Street less than enthused, the value of Netflix stock tanked today. The result, and resulting investor reaction underscores our general belief that the pandemic trade is behind us. Recall that in late December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">TechCrunch asked</a> if the era of super-rich tech valuations was behind us. The answer? Yeah, it looks like it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/european-spend-management-platform-moss-raises-86-million/">If you are working on corporate spend, please collect your check</a>: </strong>As Ramp, Brex, and Airbase battle it out in the United States, Moss’ work to build a corporate spend behemoth in Europe is attracting allies. Rich ones, it turns out, as the company just landed $86 million. The company is now worth nearly $600 million, thanks to its latest share sale.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/cana-technology-raises-glass-to-new-capital-as-it-readies-beverage-printer-for-market/">Please print me one (1) mocktail</a>: </strong>One of the funniest bits of a Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series of novels is the silly spaceship that can’t make tea. It can, to paraphrase, make something that is <em>akin</em> to tea, but not quite. That’s a long-winded way of saying that beverage printing is not a new concept. But it is a new reality, at least to my brain. Cana Technology just unveiled what it calls “the world’s first molecular beverage printer.” To which we ask: Can it make tea? Either way, this sounds dope.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/paris-based-vc-firm-partech-unveils-chapter54-accelerator-to-help-european-startups-cross-into-africa/">Europe -&gt; Africa</a>:</strong> The African technology startup market is accelerating. That’s known. But what if you are building a company, say in Europe, and want to move into the African market? Venture firm Partech’s new Chapter54 accelerator is working on just that problem, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/israels-entree-capital-raises-300m-for-israel-focused-fund-adi-gozes-becomes-partner/">Another Israeli VC puts together a new fund</a>: </strong>2022 is shaping up to be a hot year for the Israeli technology scene, with Entrée Capital announcing a $300 million fund. That’s the second new fund from Israel thus far this year that we can name. So much for a slowdown, yeah?</li>

<p>It’s great to have a stake in the company you’re helping to build, but when employees don’t know the optimal way to exercise their stock options, they usually end up with a raw deal.</p>
<p>Last year, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their options post-exit, rather than pre-exit, according to Secfi data.</p>
<p>In a post for TechCrunch+, CEO Frederik Mijnhardt shared his analysis of the biggest trends around stock options in 2021, including why, despite stellar IPOs, most employees couldn’t exercise their options until after the exit, dramatically increasing their tax liability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead to 2022, it seems that the industry’s current trend toward mega-sized rounds of funding and longer exit timelines mean that for the average startup employee, their total cost to exercise stock options will continue to rise,&#8221; says Mijnhardt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

More when the company reports earnings, as this story is far from over.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/intel-eyes-ohio-for-a-pair-of-chip-factories-amid-global-shortage/">Intel could build a huge plant in Ohio</a>:</strong> Building chips is expensive, and hard to spin up.

The Watson push seems to be stumbling to a conclusion, selling for a price that is expected to be a fraction of what IBM paid to compile the corporate assets behind its health-focused AI push.</li>

<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/how-should-non-technical-founders-collaborate-with-software-developers/">(TechCrunch+) How should non technical founders collaborate with software developers?</a> Miranda Halpern continues the TechCrunch Experts project by interviewing CEO of Wolfpack Digital, Georgina &#8216;Gina&#8217; Lupu Florian.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of your clients are non-technical people who have an idea, but no coding experience? How much of a limitation is that for launching an app?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I would say probably around 50% of our clients are in this situation, either as founders of a startup, or as representatives of companies (product owners in scale-ups, or people in corporate innovation departments, for example). We are here to help with every step of the way, so we don’t see it as a limitation at all.</p>
<p>However, it’s true that having previous experience working with agencies/developers may be useful in terms of familiarity with the software development processes. But absolutely anyone, regardless of their background, can get up to speed quickly, and we are here to support them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, 96% of visitors to your website aren’t ready to buy. Instead, they are either becoming familiar with your brand (awareness stage) or considering your products as one of many options (consideration stage). In these initial phases, you want potential prospects to put their contact details down so that you can engage them with personalized emails in the future. Unfortunately, very few customers just hand over their data like that. This is exactly where alluring magnets enter the equation.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve worked at early-stage startups where we relied on our best guesses to shape product pipelines and develop marketing strategies.</p>
<p>I have also held jobs at companies where we engaged directly with current and past customers to ask them what they wanted. You can probably guess which approach generated more favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s done informally via a Reddit AMA or a Twitter Space, it&#8217;s never a bad idea to interact with people who use your products and services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260745" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Well-researched personas are useful, but nothing is better than talking to a customer if you want to understand what delights them — and what they&#8217;re willing to pay for.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/how-to-build-a-product-advisory-council-for-your-startup/">With a product advisory council (PAC)</a>, early-stage startups can tap into the their users&#8217; hive mind. The benefits are many: PACs can help validate everything from marketing campaigns to future product planning.</p>
<p>But to build one, founders must first define clear goals and create value for participants. In this seven-step guide, you&#8217;ll find strategies and tactics for identifying key members and influencers, streamlining the communication process, and creating &#8220;a little FOMO.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+ this week. I hope you have a relaxing weekend!</p>

<p>Risk is an essential part of gambling, so it may be improper to describe Microsoft’s planned purchase of Activision Blizzard as a “bet.”</p>
<p>Considering that Microsoft has a market cap over $2 trillion, purchasing a gaming company that pumps out titles like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and Candy Crush for $68 billion isn’t exactly fraught with danger.</p>
<p>According to Box CEO Aaron Levie, the move solidifies Redmond’s entry into AR/VR gaming.</p>
<p>“If you believe VR and immersive computing is the future — whether for consumer or business use cases — Activision helps Microsoft build a flywheel of content and technology that gets more users on board to this future.”</p>

<p>2021 was a year like no other when it came to venture investment, and this year is poised to tread a similar path, writes 500 Global’s CEO and co-founder, Christine Tsai.</p>
<p>According to Tsai, 2022 will see web3 going mainstream, more capital flowing to underestimated founders, and broader investments in regions that have traditionally been overlooked.</p>
<p>“All signs point to a continued abundance of opportunities for startup founders and investors in the year ahead.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Quantum computing’s potential applications include machine learning and computer-aided drug design, but the industry is still very much in its early days.</p>
<p>In 2021, there were approximately 90 quantum investments that totaled $1.4 billion. A significant jump from $700 million the year before, but compared to SaaS, not even a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Even so, we’re already seeing quantum exits: IonQ reached a $2 billion valuation after its 2021 SPAC, and Rigetti plans to do the same this year as it develops its superconducting quantum computer.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive market map of the quantum computing industry, Maria Lepskaya, a senior associate at Runa Capital, sorted the top companies in the space into 12 quadrants, “each corresponding to particular quantum technology and a stage of startups.”</p>

<p>Climate tech startups raised $32 billion in 2021, but that amount is nowhere close to the estimated $2.5-$4.8 trillion required to fund enough adaptation and mitigation projects to make a meaningful difference.</p>
<p>Private investors can&#8217;t fill the gap alone, but VCs are in a unique position to change this dynamic.</p>
<p>By backing climate startups, they can de-risk proven climate tech, build legitimacy to attract talent, help with scaling, attract new kinds of investors, and shape the overall ecosystem, write investor Jamil Wyne and climate finance researcher Abrar Chaudhury.</p>
<p>“While most VC verticals will be assessed in terms of how much they return to investors, climate tech may be unique in that its success will also be determined, essentially, by its contribution to the preservation of our livelihoods and how much it can avoid a winner-take-all dynamic.”</p>

<p>It’s great to have a stake in the company you’re helping to build, but when employees don’t know the optimal way to exercise their stock options, they usually end up with a raw deal.</p>
<p>Last year, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their options post-exit, rather than pre-exit, according to Secfi data.</p>
<p>In a post for TechCrunch+, CEO Frederik Mijnhardt shared his analysis of the biggest trends around stock options in 2021, including why, despite stellar IPOs, most employees couldn’t exercise their options until after the exit, dramatically increasing their tax liability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead to 2022, it seems that the industry’s current trend toward mega-sized rounds of funding and longer exit timelines mean that for the average startup employee, their total cost to exercise stock options will continue to rise,&#8221; says Mijnhardt.</p>

<p>It’s important to ask potential investors questions, but first-time founders often alienate VCs by quizzing them about the breadth and depth of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The trick, according to Prashant Fonseka, a partner at Tuesday Capital: only ask <em>easy</em> questions.</p>
<p>“Save the challenging questions for a time when you’re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you’ve convinced them your company is fundable.”</p>

<p>From Buy Now, Pay Later to open banking and social finance, fintech has scaled rapidly since the pandemic began. Investment has kept pace with growth: last year, fintech accounted for more than 20% of all venture investments.</p>
<p>In a deeply researched post, Mary Ann Azevedo and Alex Wilhelm examine how fintech overtook and outperformed every other sector to the point where its outlines mirror that of the broader venture market.</p>
<p>“To some degree, it appears that what is true for the venture capital market is also true for the fintech market, but in a more exaggerated form. Fintech is like most venture, but simply more extreme.”</p>

<p>China has a mature venture investment ecosystem, but recent interventions by the country’s government to rein in the tech sector have left many wondering whether startup investment in the country may suffer permanently.</p>
<p>In The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm makes the case that the country’s venture market will take a hit — but not a lethal one.</p>
<p>“There are lots of non-corporate investors in China who are still active. So long as they persist, the numbers will not collapse,&#8221; writes Alex.</p>
<p>&#8220;But potential new regulatory rules regarding major tech companies could prove to be a material knock to the country’s venture scene.”</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a guest post by Marjorie Radlo-Zandi, the veteran angel investor shared five key elements she considers before investing.</span></p>
<p>Her advice is clear and simple, which makes it particularly valuable in an environment where startup funding is flowing faster than ever.</p>
<p>Few investors expect a first-time founder&#8217;s pitch deck to be the most definitive analysis of a particular sector, but you&#8217;re better off being cautious instead of overly optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;An extraordinarily high projection signals you’re not altogether credible, and I advise you to avoid this mistake at all costs,&#8221; says Radlo-Zandi.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s never been a better time to found a startup, but you can&#8217;t catch pennies from VC heaven if there are holes in your story.</p>

<p>“When I say new businesses, that can mean a lot of different things,&#8221; said Rhee. &#8220;We are willing to create a new business unit if the idea, suggestions and partnership hit a home run.&#8221;</p>
