<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone: Mary Ann is back! Yes, after a short absence we have our third Friday host back where she belongs. Namely right in front of a microphone, talking to us.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And it was good to have her back, as we had a small mountain of news to talk through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-marketplace-opensea-offered-10-billion-valuation">OpenSea could be worth $10 billion</a>:</strong> Right before we recorded, news broke that OpenSea could raise new capital at a far-greater valuation than it did earlier this year. While we had some jokes, we also did a little math on why OpenSea could really be worth so much money.</li>
<li><strong>Other rapid-fire funding rounds:</strong> If OpenSea does raise again, it will join good company in putting together several rounds in under a year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">Facily has done the same</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/justt-comes-out-of-stealth-with-70m-in-funding-to-help-online-merchants-fight-false-chargebacks-with-ai/">has Justt</a>. In short, the old 18-month cycle for raising capital is so dated it might as well get delivered by telegram.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/lambda-school-rebrand-bloom-institute-of-technology/">Lambda School rebrands</a>: </strong>Change at Lambda has felt inevitable for a long while. Nearly a year after its last layoff, Lambda School <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">announced more cuts in April</a> amid a broader restructuring. Then, Allred admitted that it’s been difficult to make his company’s vision work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">Casper goes private</a>:</strong> After a tough time as a public concern, DTC mattress company Casper is going private. Notably its issues have not dampened market interest in taking other DTC companies public.</li>
<li><strong>What makes a founder, a founder: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman’s legal battle to be named founding member of Compass has ended in a settlement,</a> bringing up a discussion about founder disputes and why titles matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re entering the holiday period, so expect the usual disruptions to Equity&#8217;s production calendar. We&#8217;ll be taking short breaks as per usual, but will be recharging some ahead of what should prove to be a very, very busy 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1461463681728983041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1461463681728983041%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Ftwitter-finally-brings-in-app-tipping-to-android-users-095508562.html"> rolling out</a> its in-app tipping feature to all Android users above the age of 18, following the iOS launch in September. The social media giant says the &#8220;Tips&#8221; feature is geared toward users looking to get a little financial support from their followers through Cash App, Paypal, Venmo and Patreon directly through the app. Android users can now get set up to receive tips from their profile by tapping the &#8220;Edit profile&#8221; button and then selecting &#8220;Tips&#8221; to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Tips, we&#8217;re creating an easy way to direct people to links to your payment profiles and we’re making it easier to support the people driving the conversation on Twitter – whether you want to support a content creator, help someone fundraise, tip someone who just needs some help or thank someone for making you laugh,&#8221; the social media giant <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tips">notes</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tips is now on Android!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can get set up to receive tips from your profile –– tap the “Edit profile” button then tap “Tips” to start.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1461463681728983041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter first introduced the feature in May after reports had indicated that the company was working on a direct payment option. The launch of &#8220;Tips&#8221; on Android comes a month after Twitter rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/twitter-is-bringing-ticketed-spaces-to-android-users-in-the-u-s/">&#8220;Ticketed Spaces&#8221; on Android</a>. With this feature, hosts on Spaces, Twitter’s live audio room feature, are able to sell access to Spaces. The social media giant notes that the feature is a way to support creators for their time and effort in hosting and moderating public conversations.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only social media platform pushing toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its app. Last month, TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that it is testing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">new in-app tipping feature</a> on its platform that would allow creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. The company confirmed the feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not yet widely available.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok and Twitter’s direct tipping features appear to be a way for the companies to compete with other digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube, which offer lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most noticeable &#8212; and noted &#8212; effects of climate change has been its impact on how other events in the environment &#8212; be they natural or man-made occurrences &#8212; play out: forest fires burn more violently and for longer; floods happen more often and are more severe when they do; and so on, with climate change often cited as the main culprit for all of the catastrophes. Today, an insurance startup called <a href="https://ourkettle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kettle</a> that believes it has built a better product &#8212; specifically, reinsurance underwriting product to insure insurers &#8212; to account for catastrophic events like these, by way of better data science, is announcing some funding on the heels of (sadly) more need for its services.</p>
<p>It has closed a Series A of $25 million, money that it will be using to build out tools and services for a specific set of catastrophes in one specific market: fires in California. Acrew Capital is leading the round, with Homebrew, True Ventures, Anthemis, Valor, DCVC, and LowerCarbon Capital also participating.</p>
<p>Kettle&#8217;s longer-term plan is to expand to more disaster types, and more states, in the coming years, but for now, fires in California present a particularly acute set of problems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Events like the Caldor and Dixie fires have contributed to an overall rise in the rate and size of wildfires in California, Kettle says. 2020 saw over 4% of the state burning. On average there are some 10,000 fires every year in California, but the outsized nature of some of the fires seems to be growing, with 14 fires causing 98% of the damage due to wildfire in the state.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Manning, Kettle&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Andrew Engler, said that these forces have created a gap in the market for insurance: in short, those who might want to insure their homes against these kinds of wildfires are either unable to, or end up having to pay exorbitant premiums.</p>
<p>Manning said that this is primarily because insurance companies &#8212; while ironically being the trailblazers in data science decades ago to determine risk for unexpected events &#8212; have failed to keep up with how to use that technology to account for recent developments like climate change, subsequent catastrophic environmental events, and their impact on the things that typically get insured like property, life, automobiles and so on.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;The industry hasn’t updated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the classic innovator&#8217;s dilemma.&#8221; Typically, insurance companies are using the same modeling that they have always used to try to understand what are new kinds of risks, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t look at the last five years and determine the next ten years anymore.&#8221; Communication, and making it more accurate and reflective of the situation at hand, is something of a fixation for Manning: prior to Kettle, he had been the CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/kenyan-startup-ushahidi-launches-a-crowdsourced-campaign-to-monitor-the-u-s-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushahidi</a>, the crowdsourced information startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kettle mostly presents itself as a reinsurance technology provider to customer-facing insurance companies (it also currently resells insurance that it underwrites via one channel, aimed at the most expensive properties and their owners, starting at anything over $3 million and up to $10 million).</p>
<p>This is a huge business, typified by incumbent behemoths like Lloyd&#8217;s of London, who in theory mitigate the risk insurance companies face when they get the formula wrong. Manning&#8217;s belief is that reinsurance companies also are not using enough data, and accurate enough data science or technology overall, to do their jobs to match today&#8217;s circumstances.</p>
<p>Reinsurance is currently a $400 billion-a-year industry, but it&#8217;s struggling with the cracks just starting to emerge. There has been, Kettle said, a 68% drop in return on equity because catastrophes, and their unintended consequences, have caused more than $1 billion in damage over the past 15 years. This presents an opportunity to provide a different spin on how to provide this service. Kettle&#8217;s approach is to pinpoint specific situations &#8212; in this case wildfires in California &#8212; to provide reinsurance specifically for policies or parts of policies that cover just that.</p>
<p class="p7">Using machine learning in which it combines weather data, satellite imagery and other data sets, Kettle applies a lot what has helped AI stand out from non-AI processes in other fields: the ability for machines to simply make more calculations than any human or even group of humans can.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Normally, an insurance company will run between 10,000 and 100,000 simulations to predict outcomes,&#8221; Manning said. &#8220;We run over 500 bill This means that it can account better for eventualities to help create pricing that meets them. Kettle claims to have been accurate on its predictions 89% of the time so far. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/wildfire-predicting-startup-kettle-tries-to-help-insurers-with-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>, Kettle said that some 26 insurance carriers have been in contact with it to help model their risk, and Manning told me that the company expects three to four commercial deals to close by the end of this year.</p>
<p>There is often something a little weird feeling about technology that essentially is built around the idea of bad events happening, and potentially profits from those things that go wrong. Insurance often falls into the category, not least because a lot of insurance hasn&#8217;t really been built that well, to fit modern times, and often feels exploitative, or arbitrary, or there by grace of lobbyists making sure it is mandated, more than any actual need for it. (And insurance fraud speaks to the other side of that inefficiency coin.)</p>
<p>Manning accepts this, but also sees it very differently.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;I think the industry itself is very poorly managed,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;The incentives are not in the right direction, and creating a system where the customer and company have different incentive structures is not great.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;But I do think it’s important,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;As a homeowner, if my home burns down I’ll get its value back. That can be a truly life changing thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>For investors, the disruptiveness Kettle is bringing is what attracted them, although longer term you have to imagine that the big incumbents can&#8217;t not be considering how to update their data models, too. And that could mean more business for Kettle, or an acquisition, or&#8230; death, which is perhaps fitting for a insuretech. For now, though, there&#8217;s a lot of potential still for this young startup.</p>
<p>“When you take a minute to think about it, it becomes very obvious why traditional reinsurers can&#8217;t accurately underwrite climate risk &#8212; their methodologies  look to the past,” says Lauren Kolodny, Partner at Acrew Capital, in a statement. “And our climate is changing in ways that can’t be predicted on the basis of historical data. Kettle is solving a massive, global problem. And we&#8217;re so thrilled to deepen our partnership with this incredible team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, parents received a shock when a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-02-04%20ECP%20Baby%20Food%20Staff%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform showed that some commercial baby foods were found to contain “dangerous levels” of toxic metals.</p>
<p>This caused a flurry of information in the media on the impacts and what parents can do to avoid it, which included checking ingredients. That growing awareness for nutrition also benefited food companies focused on providing more nutritious options for babies and older children.</p>
<p><a href="https://amaraorganicfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amara</a> is the latest startup in this space to raise funding, announcing today that it brought in $12 million Series A funding to expand its product line of nutrient-dense foods created for children up to seven years old. The investment comes 18 months after a $2 million seed round and growth that had the company going from from 100 to 1,000 stores.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236899" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The latest funding round was led by plant-based foods company Eat Well Group in a majority partnership, with current management in place, that values the company at $100 million, founder and CEO Jessica Sturzenegger told TechCrunch. Existing investors from the seed round also participated, including Pharmapacks.</p>
<p>Sturzenegger and her team launched Amara’s first products in Whole Foods in 2017 after three years of working on the technology. The company developed proprietary technology that locks in the taste, texture and nutrients into a shelf-stable pouch of fresh baby food meals. It has 10 SKUs and a baby food line designed to mix with breast milk, formula or water.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Packaged foods found on grocery shelves today often are fruit-based and high in sugar, coming in at a price point of $3 to $7 per meal and which also have to be kept cold or frozen, she added. By contrast, Amara’s meals start as low as $1.80 per meal, in keeping with the company’s mission to provide products that cater to a wider range of family budgets.</p>
<p>This year, Amara expanded on that to produce its Yogurt Smoothie Melts, which Sturzenegger touts as “the only melt-in-mouth snacks for babies and toddlers without any added sugar.”</p>
<p>“Studies show that the food you eat from zero to seven years old impacts how you think, feel and perform later on in life,” Sturzenegger told TechCrunch “‘You are what you eat’ may be a cliché, but studies show it is also true, and parents are paying attention.”</p>
<p>Prior to taking the Series A dollars, Amara was already profitable on every order; in fact, it was growing three times year over year organically and through word of mouth, but after the baby food report came out in February, Sturzenegger said the company garnered increased attention by both parents and venture capital firms.</p>

<p>“Amara has proven an impressive ability to scale through retail distribution and e-commerce excellence, and the funding and industry expertise from Eat Well Group will help accelerate Amara’s growth as we head into 2022,” said Marc Aneed, president of Eat Well Group, in a written statement.</p>
<p>The funding will enable Amara to grow fast to meet the demand as it invests in hiring, product development and brand awareness. In addition to grocery stores, the company sells via its website, Amazon and grocery stores mostly in California, but in Sprouts nationwide. Over the next 12 months, Sturzenegger plans to get Amara’s products into more grocery stores.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shift to nutrition is providing room for many startups to disrupt the baby and child food market. As such, the <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/baby-food-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global baby food market</a> was valued at $67.3 billion in 2019, and is expected to grow to $96.3 billion by 2027, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1218/baby-food-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.3 billion of that revenue</a> coming from the U.S. market currently.</p>
<p>Venture capital firms have taken notice, pumping fresh capital into food companies focused on infants and children, like Little Spoon, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/little-spoon-scoops-up-44m-to-grow-its-childrens-nutrition-delivery-service/">$44 million in Series B funding</a> in July, while Serenity Kids, offering low-sugar baby food, took in<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-baby-food-brand-serenity-kids-expands-product-line-with-7m-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $7 million in Series A</a> funding in June.</p>
<p>“There is room in the market, and for everyone to target different parents and price points,” Sturzenegger said. “Our niche is good food for everyone. If we are going to change the way the future generation eats, it has to be accessible.”</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Switzerland-based privacy tech startup, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym Technologies</a>, which is trying to commercialize an old idea for privacy-centric infrastructure (mixnets) by combining it with buzzy crypto incentives, has closed $13 million in Series A investment from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto-focused fund, following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/nym-gets-6m-for-its-anonymous-overlay-mixnet-to-sell-privacy-as-a-service/">$6M raise we covered back in the summer</a> (also loosely pegged as a Series A).</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/11/17/andreessen-horowitz-leads-investment-in-privacy-startup-integrating-with-bitcoin/">Forbes</a>, which had the exclusive on the latest tranche of funding, the round values the nascent European startup at circa $270M.</p>
<p>Other investors are named as including Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, Tayssir Capital, Huobi Ventures, HashKey, Fenbushi Capital, and &#8220;more than two dozen&#8221; operators of validator nodes, or servers responsible for verifying transactions on Nym&#8217;s network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Trumpeting the raise earlier this week, founder Harry Halpin <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1461100059374805003">tweeted</a> that Nym&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;see crypto destroy surveillance economy within the next years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although the tweet earned him some instant trolling over taking VC investment for a privacy-centric project; and, er, for taking VC investment from a fund whose investment portfolio sprawls deep into the surveillance economy &#8212; including the likes of privacy-eviscerating adtech giant Facebook and Sam Altman&#8217;s (literal) eyeball-scanning crypto dystopia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wants-to-scan-every-humans-eyeball-and-give-them-crypto-in-exchange/">Worldcoin</a>, both of which have rather more in common with fuelling surveillance than driving privacy. But, hey, no one goes to VC for those kind of &#8216;values&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We at Nym, who for have been fighting  to end mass surveillance for years without mainstream support, see the tides are turning for privacy. With the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@a16z</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DCGco</a>, and many more, I hope <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nymproject</a> will see crypto destroy surveillance economy within the next years! <a href="https://t.co/rRNFSYizjb">https://t.co/rRNFSYizjb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; harryhalpin (@harryhalpin) <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1461100059374805003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Forbes, Nym&#8217;s test network has around 5,000 nodes and 30 validators at this stage &#8212; and is expected to go live at full capacity by the end of this year. Although Halpin told us the test network had around 9,000 nodes when we spoke to him back in July. So quite what full network capacity will mean (in terms of nodes) isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>In a further scoop, Forbes reports that the startup has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/08/25/chelsea-manning-is-back-and-hacking-again-only-this-time-for-a-bitcoin-based-privacy-startup/">hired former U.S. Army intelligence analyst and whistleblower, Chelsea Manning</a>, to work on client side security.</p>
<p>It couches Nym&#8217;s beefed up Series A as a sign of the rising store being placed on privacy infrastructure &#8212; quoting Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, offering the qualified claim that [emphasis ours]: “Encryption is <em>becoming</em> an incredibly important component of the internet today&#8221;; and describing Nym&#8217;s tech as serving up &#8220;privacy at the very bottom layer as a foundation for other private solutions to be built on top&#8221;.</p>
<p>Quite how Andreessen Horowitz valued (or, well, didn&#8217;t) encryption in earlier Internet decades is certainly one to ponder.</p>
<p>Nym, meanwhile, is using the a16z-led capital injection to expand the size of its team (to up to 30) as it gears up to launch the mainnet &#8212; slated to happen some time in the next few weeks. It is also, per Forbes, planning to award grants to third party developers to encourage them to build for the network, starting next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Given its product market fit in real estate, Zuma now aims to implement its business model into other industries with sales teams, like healthcare, automotive, insurance, education and fashion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Looking for a new apartment is either a leisurely thing to do or something that has to take place quite quickly. When you don’t reach anyone in the leasing office, you often move on to the next one on the list, even if it was one you would have considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getzuma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuma</a> wants to ensure that any reach out for information is answered in minutes versus days. Today, the company, which adds artificial intelligence to sales engagement, exited its beta phase with $6.7 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by CEO Shiv Gettu, a former real estate consultant, and president Kendrick Bradley, a former Boeing and SpaceX engineer who left his job in 2018 to work at a property management company. They both saw the pain points for real estate sales teams and together built a tech-driven Airbnb-like hospitality property company that grew to $2 million in revenue in nine months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the global pandemic hit, they had long-term lease commitments, but with business and leisure travel halted, they pivoted their company into a virtual leasing office using AI to automate the conversion process, which became Zuma, Gettu said in an interview.</p>
<p>He noted statistics that showed a <a href="https://www.hireaiva.com/blog/real-estate-isa-missing-80-pct-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of real estate leads</a> tend to come in at night and on weekends, when leasing agents aren’t usually on property, and that response gap of waiting until the next business day can account for a decrease of <a href="https://www.onecavo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MIT-InsideSales.com_Lead-Response-Management.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 times after half an hour</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236716" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236716" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2236716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png" alt="Zuma" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png 3458w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=1536,843 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=2048,1124 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236716" class="wp-caption-text">Zuma app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zuma</p></div></p>
<p>Zuma’s AI-powered agent, Kelsey, answers complex questions about a property as they come in, and via text message, to encourage any hot lead to become a booking customer, even outside of normal business hours. It also brings in a human-in-the-loop aspect, if the questions are outside the scope of Kelsey’s ability, to respond.</p>
<p>“We understood the value of leads and the importance of nurturing them,” Bradley told TechCrunch. “Text messages engage with prospects immediately. If you’re interested in an apartment, you might not hear back for 48 hours, but Zuma integrates with property management tools and when a lead inquires, Kelsey gives them information on the property and the policies with the idea of them then coming in to view the property and sign a lease.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since January, the company has grown revenue by 10 times and is working with customers like Bungalow.com, which see an average conversion rate increase of 2.1 times in 30 days and 35 times return on investment, while saving an average of 50% on sales staffing costs.</p>
<p>Joining Andreessen Horowitz in the investment were Y Combinator, Range Ventures, Liquid 2, Day One Ventures, Soma Capital and a group of individual investors, including Apartment List co-founder Chris Erikson, former Y Combinator COO Qasar Younis and Lambda School founder Austen Allred. The latest funding round gives Zuma a total of $7.2 million raised to date.</p>
<p>Gettu says the company has hit a good rhythm with its initial product, so the new capital will go into new features, hiring and expanding sales to capture the market. Zuma is also looking to implement its business model into other industries with sales teams, like healthcare, automotive, insurance, education and fashion.</p>
<p>“Zuma’s blend between human support and AI creates a magical conversation experience for prospective customers that drastically increases conversion,” Connie Chan, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, shared in a statement. “The Zuma team has proven their impact for property management teams, and the sky&#8217;s the limit as this platform grows to serve and help scale any industry that has leads that require nurturing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.flytrex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flytrex</a>, the Israeli startup working with <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/09/walmart-now-piloting-on-demand-drone-delivery-with-flytrex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, Chilli&#8217;s, and others in North Carolina in pilots for a drone-based delivery service targeting suburban consumers, has picked up $40 million in funding to continue developing its hardware and software, and more business partnerships, as it awaits regulatory nods to expand its service to more markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>While others like Amazon are looking at building their own drone services (Amazon&#8217;s service called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8037720011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Air</a>), Flytrex claimes that its drone pilot in the North Carolina is the biggest of its kind at the moment. But it&#8217;s just the start of a bigger delivery service and fleet that Flytrex is hoping to build, taking the approach of getting its drones certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as commercial aircraft to give it the most flexibility in how it can design and run its business in the long run.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that we&#8217;ll have national approval by the first half of next year,&#8221; said Yariv Bash, Flytrex&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview. &#8220;We are in the process with the FAA, which we started more than a year ago.&#8221; The first part of its efforts was taking part in the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/integration_pilot_program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP)</span></a> (UAS: unmanned aircraft system, which includes dronts) which concluded in October 2020; now it&#8217;s continuing that with another initiative, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">BEYOND</span></a><span class="s4">,</span> and it is working with the North Carolina Department of Transportation &#8220;to help tackle the remaining challenges of UAS integration.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237087" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Currently Flytrex approved to fly in North Carolina for a distance of 1 nautical mile (just over 1 land mile), he said, but the aircraft that the company has designed have a range of three miles in each direction currently, so that will be part of what it hopes to offer in future.</p>
<p>This is a Series C that brings the total raised by Flytrex to $60 million. <span class="s4">BRM Group</span> is leading the round, with participation also from <span class="s4">OurCrowd (the SoftBank-backed, Israel-based crowdfunded investor); </span>Lukasz Gadowski; and previous investors <a href="https://benhamouglobalventures.com/"><span class="s4">Benhamou Global Ventures (BGV)</span></a>, <a href="https://btov.vc/"><span class="s4">btov</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.backboneventures.ch/"><span class="s4">BackBone Ventures</span></a>. In a list mostly filled with financial backers, there is one interesting strategic name: Gadowski is the founder and chairman of Delivery Hero, a big player in online food delivery around the world using land-based transportation.</p>
<p>Delivery Hero is not working with Flytrex now, but Bash said that more generally the startup believes that existing on-demand delivery platforms like DoorDash, Delivery Hero and the rest could be potential partners and customers: in cases where established delivery brands want to complement their own fleets with an air-based mode, they might integrate with Flytrex rather than trying to build it themselves.</p>
<h2>&#8216;We are producing commercial airplanes, not drones&#8217;</h2>
<p>Flytrex was founded and is finding traction with early customers and investors on the back of a fairly simple premise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On-demand delivery services using bikes and four-wheeled vehicles are just about starting to work out the positive unit economics of providing services in dense, urban areas: the key is to double or triple up orders, or make them short enough loops that drivers can fit in many in the space of a day of work.</p>
<p>That formula doesn&#8217;t quite fly, so to speak, when we are talking about people in more spread-out residential areas, such as suburbs &#8212; especially when the cargo, in Bash&#8217;s words, &#8220;is just a $5 burrito.&#8221; It costs too much to send people out, both to restaurants and to customers, which each pay fees to keep the cost of that burrito from looking too ridiculous, and couriers also end up carrying costs that eat into their own margins. &#8220;It’s a lose-lose-lose situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Flytrex believes that in these cases, a drone-based system, which zips around and is managed remotely and deposits whatever the cargo happens to be into a customer&#8217;s backyard, is the solution.</p>
<p>The opportunity is a huge one in a market like the U.S., where some two-thirds of the population lives in suburban areas. &#8220;The major cities&#8221; &#8212; where so much of on-demand delivery has focused up to now &#8212; &#8220;are basically niche,&#8221; Bash said.</p>
<p>Flytrex is taking a very vertical &#8212; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no pun intended</a> &#8212; approach in its business model, starting first with the hardware and how the service is designed.</p>
<p>Drawing on the breadth of experience you get in Israel in building hardware, computer vision and other AI technology, and cloud services, the startup has designed its own drones and software that is used to control them.</p>
<p>Given the FAA process that it&#8217;s going through to get that hardware certified as aircraft &#8212; &#8220;I am standing in line with Lockheed, Boeing, and Amazon. Everyone has to stand in line,&#8221; Bash told me &#8212; strictly speaking, he doesn&#8217;t refer to his aircraft with the D-word.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are producing commercial airplane, not drones,&#8221; he said, a process that has added, he estimates, three to five years to its timeline for getting approval. There are many, many companies making drones today, so much so that you could argue it has become commoditized. Bash doesn&#8217;t completely rule out the idea of using hardware made by others one day, but notes that this lengthy timeline, and the software that it has built around its hardware, will make this unlikely anytime soon.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the future if I can get a more affordable airplane than producing my own, we are more than happy to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Around the &#8220;drone&#8221; &#8212; or whatever you might call it &#8212; is a bigger tech stack and database that Flytrex is building. It&#8217;s mapped out backyards in the communities it serves, so that it knows where to fly and drop off packages so that they are relatively safe for drop-and-go deliveries so that people can walk out of the back of their houses to pick them up. Bash said that Flytrex has amassed data on more than 80 million backyards. Google Maps and the others that power the mapping services for the various delivery companies in the market today might have figured out all the front doors, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll have the back doors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p9">Added to this is a wider fleet system design that sits in the cloud to manage where and when drones are operating. The idea is that Flytrex doesn&#8217;t operate these directly all the time, but works with its equivalent of &#8220;couriers&#8221; to do so: these can be the same people who today delivery packages via bikes or cars, and they will be trained to become &#8220;flight operators&#8221; who will work via third-party companies to operate the drones. (As an equivalent, this would not be unlike how some on-demand transport platforms contract with individuals, but also local fleets that use the platform to pick up business.)</p>
<p class="p9">The early version of the service so far seems to have found willing customers on both sides of the marketplace. Flytrex&#8217;s first-ever service was launched in <span class="s5">Reykjavik</span>, Iceland in 2017, but the first U.S. pilot started only about a year ago, in September 2020 in Fayetteville, NC. It has since expanded to a second location, Raeford, NC. Flytrex said that since February 2021, the volume of orders has increased more than tenfold, with thousands of deliveries to date.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s all smooth sailing, though. Flytrex&#8217;s service has been years in the making already, and Bash admits nothing is easy. Even others like Amazon have seen ups and downs: the company also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a key FAA hurdle</a> recently, too, but in recent weeks has seen the <a href="https://insideunmannedsystems.com/amazon-prime-air-co-founder-gur-kimchi-joins-near-earth-autonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-founder of Prime Air leave the company</a>, and moreover it seems to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/amazon-s-prime-air-drone-unit-quietly-disbanded-french-r-d-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mothballing some of its R&amp;D efforts</a> for the project.</p>
<p class="p5">And beyond these specific businesses, there is a strong degree of skepticism around anything involving autonomous transportation of any kind.</p>
<p class="p5">But while some indeed may see drone delivery services as still something of a moonshot &#8212; ironic considering Bash&#8217;s previous entrepreneurial effort as the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarivbash/?originalSubdomain=il" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founder of SpaceIL</a> &#8212; but there are enough shortcomings with existing delivery services, and enough advances in autonomous systems, that might well merit at least some bets being taken here for strong rewards ahead, as far as investors are concerned.</p>
<p class="p5">And if big companies like Amazon will be doing something in the space &#8212; either for itself or just as likely as a service for third parties &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely important for there to be alternatives and choice in the market for those that opt not to go the Amazon route.</p>
<p class="p4">“We are committed to supporting companies that have the potential to change people’s lives for the better, and Flytrex’s impact on retailers and consumers alike fits that mission perfectly,” said Eran Barkat, Partner at BRM Group, in a statement. “Drones are playing a key role in revolutionizing last mile delivery for communities around the world, and we are thrilled to support the Flytrex team as they take the future of food and household delivery to new heights.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Helaina is tapping into a precision fermentation process that programs yeast cells and teaches them to become manufacturing hubs to develop almost identical proteins found in human milk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myhelaina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helaina</a>, a company producing a first-of-its-kind infant milk, announced $20 million in Series A financing to usher in its next phase of growth that includes beginning the manufacturing and commercialization process for its first product.</p>
<p>Food scientist Laura Katz, who also teaches food science at New York University, founded the company in 2019, and touts it as “the first company making functional human proteins for food.”</p>
<p>To do this, Helaina is tapping into a precision fermentation process that programs yeast cells and teaches them to become manufacturing hubs to develop almost identical proteins found in human milk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When we started Helaina, there was a lot of technology going into a lot of industries, but feeding babies had not advanced too much,” Katz told TechCrunch. “For me, when I thought about where in the population to advance nutrition and health, infants and parents were the first thing that came to me.”</p>
<p>As the infant formula market, poised to be a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infant-formula-market-size-to-reach-usd-103-75-billion-by-2026--fortune-business-insights-300929520.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$103 billion market by 2026</a>, grows, there continues to be shame and stigma around how to feed children in their early years, and Helaina aims to provide parents with a choice of foods that are priced to be accessible to all, but also support as they examine their choices, she said.</p>
<p>Helaina created its first protein and now wants to create all of breast milk’s components, though one at a time. Not only will its product provide calories, but also it will help to build immunity against fungal, bacterial and viral diseases.</p>
<p>The company’s latest round was co-led by Spark Capital and Siam Capital, and includes Plum Alley Investments and Primary Venture Partners. It gives the company $24.6 million in total funding, which includes a $4.6 million combined round of pre-seed and seed investments from 2019 and 2020, respectively, Katz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was a planned round, but what Katz noted was unexpected was the “overwhelming interest” in the company from investors.</p>
<p>“What we found in raising money is such a personal connection to what we are doing,” she added. “So much is happening in food tech, but seeing the ability to use this tech for a product so close to people’s heart has been overwhelming. Lots of people are interested in what we are doing.”</p>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to scale with manufacturing partners to prepare for commercialization. The goal is to grow capability, round out the executive team and finalize go-to-market plans.</p>
<p>The company is working to gain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its product and then has plans to use its proteins in a host of consumer products that will be clinically proven, essentially creating a new category within the consumer sector that broadens the definition of nutrition to include immunity, Katz said.</p>
<p>Helaina is not alone in working to create a formula that is more nutritious and best resembles human milk. Earlier this year, Bobbie raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/bobbie-bags-15m-series-a-to-create-a-better-baby-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million in Series A funding</a> for its formula modeled after European brands. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639417/can-this-startup-engineer-a-better-baby-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ByHeart</a> is also developing a formula, while <a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/biomilq-says-it-has-successfully-produced-worlds-first-cell-cultured-human-breast-milk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomilq</a> says it has produced the “world’s first cell-cultured human milk outside of the breast.”</p>

<p>Katz says the approach her company is taking to create the proteins and focus on making a product that is better in terms of health outcomes is what differentiates Helaina from its competitors.</p>
<p>“Helaina is the first company to bring human proteins to food,” she added. “No one else has done this before. As we expand technology to parents to feed growing children, we are creating this new category that is like consumer immunology.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is one of the first investments that Sita Chantramonklasri made from her new fund, Siam Capital, which she said invests in businesses that are at the intersection of sustainability and consumer need.</p>
<p>Chantramonklasri spends a lot of her time in the food tech space and heard about Helaina long before she was connected with Katz by Kevin Thau, who led the seed round for Spark Capital, she said.</p>
<p>At the time, she was doing a deep dive into the breast milk space and was looking at some of the novel technology in the space from some of Helaina’s competitors. She spent a lot of time with Katz to understand her background and what Helaina was doing in the space. After spending time in the laboratory and seeing the company’s yeast engineering experience, Chantramonklasri said she felt that Helaina was providing a science-forward product.</p>
<p>“Laura is a fantastic founder and wise beyond her years [she’s 29 years old!] and wants to see the mission of Helaina through,” she added. “The market will get more competitive and timing is the play as is customer loyalty. Helaina is in a position to be an advocate for mothers and families. From a technology standpoint, it is too early to tell what will happen. We see innovation in other cell culture technologies like the Biomilq, but Helaina will be a leader in the space from a progress standpoint.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-backed Flipkart is acquiring online pharmacy startup SastaSundar to enter the healthcare segment in India as e-commerce battle intensifies in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Flipkart said it has signed definitive agreements to acquire a majority stake in <a href="https://www.sastasundar.com">SastaSundar</a>, but did not disclose the size of the deal. Eight-year-old SastaSundar was last valued at $125 million in a financing round in 2019. The Kolkata-headquartered startup, which works with over 490 pharmacies, raised $48.2 million across several financial rounds prior to the current deal, according to research firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>India’s top e-commerce platform, which is valued is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">valued at over $37 billion</a>, said its healthcare vertical will be called Flipkart Health+. Flipkart&#8217;s planned foray into the healthcare space comes at a time when the market is seeing both consolidation and aggressive investments.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon India, Flipkart&#8217;s chief rival in India, began selling medicines on its marketplace last year. Reliance Retail, the largest retail chain in India, acquired the parent firm of online pharmacy Netmeds last year. Its conglomerate rival, Tata Digital bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/tata-digital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-1mg/">online pharmacy 1mg in June</a></p>
<p>PharmEasy, the market leading healthcare startup, filed for an $843 million initial public offering earlier this month.</p>
<p>E-pharmacies today accounts for less than 5% of the pharma market and its &#8220;scope for growth is very high with increasing awareness, digital penetration and increasing comfort with online transaction in other categories,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein said in a report earlier this year. &#8220;Even with low levels of penetration, there has been significant levels of consolidation with players exiting and M&amp;A activity,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Ravi Kant Sharma, founder and chief executive of SastaSundar said the startup&#8217;s majority stake acquisition to Flipkart will accelerate the younger firm&#8217;s mission to &#8220;provide affordable healthcare to all Indians in a convenient manner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The consumer internet ecosystem in India is growing rapidly as consumers recognize the opportunities and convenience that digital adoption is enabling in their lives. With growing awareness and focus on health heightened by the pandemic, there is a large opportunity and demand for affordable healthcare and ancillary offerings,” said Ravi Iyer, Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Development at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are excited to enter this space through this investment in SastaSundar.com, a company that has established itself as a trusted partner for lakhs of consumers through genuine products, a technology-powered platform and a wide network. The synergies between the Flipkart Group and SatsaSundar.com, combined with our commitment to prioritize our customer’s needs, will help us grow and transform online healthcare in India.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like Nio, Chinese electric car maker Xpeng has kickstarted its international expansion. But unlike its rival, which put on a series of splashy campaigns in Norway, Xpeng launched quietly in the Scandinavian country last month.</p>
<p>In Norway, Xpeng has begun shipping its G3 SUVs and P7 sedans. The Chinese EV startup aims to enter more European markets in 2022, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Xpeng has stayed low-key with its overseas expansion probably because it was waiting to launch its first &#8220;international&#8221; model, the G9 SUV that came to light today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236299" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;G9 is our first model to be conceived and developed from the ground up for both the international and Chinese markets, bringing our most sophisticated designs to our customers worldwide,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s co-founder and president Henry Xia said at an auto exhibition on Friday.</p>
<p>The SUV is Xpeng&#8217;s fourth production model and will be the first to possess the carmaker&#8217;s latest advanced driver assistance system. The ADAS, called Xpilot 4.0, is built for urban driving, as Xpeng <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> at its Tech Day last month. Baking Xpilot 4.0 into a passenger car is ambitious, as the version aims to assist anything from &#8220;vehicle start-up to parking,&#8221; a big step closer to fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>Xpilot 4.0&#8217;s computing power comes from two Nvidia Orin-X system-on-the-chip units. Its hardware includes a mix of cameras, lidar, millimeter-wave radar, and a 3D visual perception network.</p>
<p>In other words, G9 will be layered with sensors. But Xpeng tries to make them inconspicuous. Its dual-lidar units, for example, have been integrated into the headlights. Lidar had traditionally been too expensive for mass-produced cars, but Xpeng and other industry players are working to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make the sensing tech affordable</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>G9 is not launching in China until the third quarter of 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter, so European customers won&#8217;t likely get to try the SUV until 2023.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Xpeng has much work to do before its highly autonomous passenger cars are ready to ship internationally. It will need to set up charging networks in its target markets, a process that is prone to COVID disruptions. Xpilot also relies on high-definition mapping, so the Chinese firm will probably need to team up with local navigation providers.</p>
<p>Xpeng may also be questioned by local governments regarding the safety of its smart cars. Governments around the world vary in their attitude toward vehicle autonomy, and episodes of collisions involving Tesla&#8217;s ADAS have only increased their skepticism about the tech&#8217;s readiness.</p>
<p>Xpeng has done some preparation in this regard. For instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/">will be testing drivers</a> and giving them a safety score before letting them activate Xpilot. Its vehicles&#8217; built-in monitoring system will also keep vetting drivers and may revoke Xpilot access if it determines a driver is acting irresponsibly.</p>
<h2><strong>Other specs</strong></h2>
<p>The G9 is compatible with Xpeng&#8217;s &#8220;superchargers&#8221;, 800V high-voltage mass-production SiC (silicon carbide) that&#8217;s able to charge a car for up to 200 km of range within five minutes.</p>
<p>The SUV comes with a &#8220;fault detection&#8221; system that can identify the fault location after a breakdown. The system will then display the service center with available inventory as well as estimated repair time and cost.</p>
<p>Lastly, the G9 uses the Gigabit Ethernet communications architecture, which &#8220;improves communications and support&#8221; for higher-level autonomous driving, smart cockpits, and OTA upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced Thursday that it&#8217;s running a test to give users a sliver more control over what they see on the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237048" style="width: 252px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237048" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2237048 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?w=242" alt="Facebook test feature" width="242" height="335" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png 242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=108,150 108w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=217,300 217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The test will go live on Facebook&#8217;s app for English-speaking users. It adds three sub-menus into Facebook&#8217;s menu for managing what shows up in the News Feed: friends and family, groups and pages and public figures. Users in the test can choose to keep the ratio of those posts in their feed at &#8220;normal&#8221; or change it to more or less, depending on their preferences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237031" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Anyone in the test can do the same for topics, designating things they are interested in or stuff they&#8217;d rather not see. In a blog post, Facebook says the test will affect &#8220;a small percentage of people&#8221; around the world before the test expands gradually in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Facebook will also be expanding a tool that allows advertisers to exclude their content from certain topic domains, letting brands opt out of appearing next to &#8220;news and politics,&#8221; &#8220;social issues&#8221; and &#8220;crime and tragedy. &#8220;When an advertiser selects one or more topics, their ad will not be delivered to people recently engaging with those topics in their News Feed,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s algorithms are notorious for promoting inflammatory content and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/03/facebook-misinformation-nyu-study/">dangerous misinformation</a>. Given that, Facebook— and its newly-named parent company Meta — are under mounting regulatory pressure to clean up the platform and make its practices more transparent. As Congress mulls solutions that could give users more control over what they see and tear down some of the opacity around algorithmic content, Facebook is likely holding out hope that there&#8217;s still time left to self-regulate.</p>
<p>Last month before Congress, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen called attention to the ways that Facebook&#8217;s opaque algorithms can prove dangerous, particularly in countries beyond the company&#8217;s most scrutinized markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even within the U.S. and Europe, the company&#8217;s decision to prioritize engagement in its News Feed ranking systems enabled divisive content and politically inflammatory posts to soar.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is that it’s optimizing for content that gets engagement, or reaction,&#8221; Haugen said on &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; last month. &#8220;But its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing — it’s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.&#8221;</p>

Last week, we learned more about what, exactly, persuaded investors to assign the five-year-old a whopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/heres-how-rippling-fresh-off-its-series-c-aims-to-center-companies-around-employee-identity/">$6.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>On the same day of that announcement, we had an unexpected opportunity to sit down with Conrad in person at an event we were hosting in the city. We didn&#8217;t plan to interview him (a friend slated to do this fractured her arm ahead of their sit-down), but we thoroughly enjoyed the conversation, where we talked more about Rippling but also asked Conrad for his advice to entrepreneurs who have enjoyed extreme <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2020/05/28/the-comeback-of-a-fallen-tech-unicorn-ceo/?sh=3191868c100a">highs</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2016/02/08/zenefits-ceo-parker-conrad-resigns-amid-scandal/?sh=7381498b8314">lows</a>, as he famously has.</p>

<p>Founders whose companies have floundered or who otherwise have lost control of what they were building might benefit from watching the interview. In the meantime, we&#8217;ve pulled out some highlights from the conversation, edited for clarity.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>TC: Rippling is building what you call an employee system. In fact, the last time we spoke, you mentioned that unlike Salesforce, which ties a lot of business systems together around a common customer identify, Rippling makes employees the centerpiece of this unified schema. Where do you find the confidence to compare your company to a $300 billion outfit like Salesforce?</strong></p>
<p>PC: People misunderstand, in my view, what Salesforce is because they think it&#8217;s a CRM system. I think Salesforce is really a system for managing business process and workflow across your company that happens to be built on this underlying foundation of customer data. And the thesis of Rippling, and the analogy to Salesforce, is that we think there exists within your company an entirely <em>separate</em> set of business process and workflow that requires a lot of the same tooling that you find in Salesforce &#8212; things like building workflow automations, for reporting and analytics, for policies and configurations, and things like that, but that it needs it to be built on a different underlying primitive. [We think] there&#8217;s this sort of bizarro world version of Salesforce where everything is re-centered around employee data. And that is really the internally facing system to manage your company, as opposed to the externally facing system that Salesforce is for managing a lot of your business process related to customers and sales and marketing and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You also say you are building this &#8216;compound model&#8217; that involves a lot of separate businesses being built at once so that they can be integrated and bundled in different ways for your customers. You&#8217;ve argued that this model makes more sense than focusing more narrowly on one opportunity. But how replicable is this model for founders who don&#8217;t have the connections and resources that you do?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PC: It&#8217;s something that I believe that almost no one else agrees with &#8212; that most of the conventional wisdom around building a company, which is that you should focus on one very narrow thing and do it extremely well &#8212; is probably now wrong. It&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve gotten into this problem that businesses have, where they now have a collection of 100 separate point solution products. The root of a lot of the irreducible crap work involved in running a company is often managing employee information across all these different systems.</p>
<p>The alternative, a compound startup, involves building multiple different products in parallel and usually allows you to solve a larger business process problem that stretches across a number of previously distinct business systems . . . Ten years ago, the big question that everyone had is &#8216;How many of these SaaS products can actually become billion dollar companies?&#8217; And the answer, it turned out, was every single one of them. [But] a lot of those focused opportunities are really picked over now [whereas] there are these undiscovered islands of product-market fit just beyond the horizon line if you&#8217;re willing to go out and try and build this much harder thing, which is a couple of interrelated products that work together seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>TC: But you&#8217;re Parker Conrad, so you can raise capital, and you can also get founders whose companies perhaps floundered to come work for you and run these divisions. Is that really replicable? </strong></p>
<p>PC: So one thing: if you do companies that are building this way, you need to organize them slightly differently. One of the ways that we&#8217;re able to successfully build different products in parallel is by having more of a business unit structure, where [we hire] former founders to run specific product lines and build them and really run them as general managers. I think we now have 50 founders who work at Rippling in various different capacities.</p>
<p>[As for how we find those founders] I mean, I remember when I did my first startup. It was slow grinding failure for seven years, we could never raise any money from anyone, and when I left, it was impossible. I was looking for a job. I couldn&#8217;t find one. So I had to start a company instead. At the time, there were no specific skills I had. I was the founder of this company that had gone nowhere, that no one had ever heard of. I wasn&#8217;t really qualified to run any specific function. Now I think the world has changed a little bit. It&#8217;s much easier to find those types of jobs as a founder . . .</p>
<p>You also mentioned like, well, okay, you know, you [being Parker Conrad] can raise money to do something like this, but can other people? And I think they can. There is a lot of money in the market right now, and if you can paint a picture of a really ambitious idea, of what you want to do, there are people who will fund it, and you can raise a lot of money to go after it. [It&#8217;s also] easier to attract employees to a really big and ambitious vision.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You rose to fame with Zenefits. Things went wrong, which we&#8217;ve talked about a little bit in the past. I do want to ask how you went about those first investor meetings for Rippling, because you got right back out there. Were they difficult?</strong></p>
<p>PC: Actually, raising money was for Rippling after Zenefits was not hard. There were investors who were extremely supportive. And I will be forever grateful to Y Combinator, Garry Tan and Initialized Capital, Mamoon at Kleiner Perkins, [and] a whole ton of seed investors who signed up immediately, like, I mean, no questions. Well, I think a lot of them did their own diligence about what had happened in Zenefits. And there was also obviously a set of investors that that wasn&#8217;t true for. And it was really just that there were enough of the people who were extremely supportive that it wasn&#8217;t an issue.</p>

<p><strong>TC: I read in a Forbes piece last year that right after Zenefits, you were binge watching &#8220;Star Wars.&#8221; But just for six weeks [were you laying low]. In the interest of helping others who may go through their own roller coaster ride, how did you pull yourself together and get back out there?</strong></p>
<p>PC: I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out. What it felt like to me when things went south &#8212; and one thing that I think not everyone realizes &#8212; is that there are people that have this entire institutional apparatus behind them, who have crisis PR firms and institutional backing and money. And then there was like, me, and I was hiding in my house, you know, watching &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; and trying to ignore the outside world and really not talking to anyone.</p>
<p>And it took a long time. I was under an enormous amount of restrictions over what I could even say about that experience. And because I wasn&#8217;t allowed to talk to people about this, there was a moment where I realized that the only way that I was going to talk to the larger tech community, to the media, to my extended friends and family, to my former colleagues, to talk about this experience, was to build this specific company and to turn it into something that would would become hopefully a $100 billion dollar outcome and that would force some kind of conversation or reassessment of this [past history]. So that was the thing that, for a long time, kind of got me out of bed in the morning. It was leading me to focus on building this business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In that same article, Garry Tan said you&#8217;re a great founder because you have a chip on your shoulder. Does that resonate and, if so, is that because of what happened at Zenefits or does it date back even further?</strong></p>
<p>PC: Is this StrictlyVC of strictly therapy or whatever? [Laughs.] Yeah, no, I think I&#8217;ve probably always felt that way, even before Zenefits, and I like hiring people and working with people who also have a little bit of a chip on their shoulder. I think it works out better if you have a chip on your shoulder but also a sense of humor. If you just have a chip on your shoulder, maybe you&#8217;re kind of a prick. But people who have both those things can be a lot of fun to work with and often can really accomplish some awesome stuff, so those are the people who I like to spend time with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are 13 surviving copies of the original print of the U.S. Constitution. Today, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) announced it lost its bid to buy one from art dealer Sotheby’s after a high-stakes bidding war that captured the internet&#8217;s attention. Still, the bold ascendance of the DAO, a group of people who met on the internet, is a unique case study into the art of on-ramping swaths of people into crypto, one meme and auction at a time.</p>
<p>After a brief flurry of excitement on Twitter, where some members of the group mistakenly announced they had won in a live Twitter Spaces chat, the group <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461498841820192771/photo/1">released a statement</a> saying it had lost after all. The group &#8220;broke records for the most money crowdfunded in less than 72 hours,&#8221; per the statement.</p>
<p>One organizer said in the group&#8217;s Discord channel that it lost because it had not raised enough money to establish a reserve required to maintain and care for the document on an ongoing basis. Participants in the ConstitutionDAO will be able to get their money back, minus gas fees, according to the group. Given the fact that there are no governance tokens that have yet been given to participants, the return of money could be further complicated if some members want to remain in the group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236961" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Austin Cain and Graham Novak, two 25-year-old Atlanta residents working in finance, first started a Discord chat to launch the effort, which now has more than 8,000 members. Within a week of launching, the DAO raised over $40 million worth of ETH on <a href="https://juicebox.money/#/">Juicebox</a>, an early stage DAO platform.</p>
<p>The effort, largely spun up through Twitter and a ballooning Discord server, is a window into what a community effort could look and feel like in a Web3 universe, where shared ownership and transparency are guiding principles. The opportunities presented by the DAO structure are sparking widespread interest &#8212; the value governed by DAO treasuries is now at over $6 billion, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/biggest-daos-now-hold-6b-worth-of-digital-assets-consensys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per some estimates</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Daniel Monteagudo got a message at 7:57 p.m. from a friend asking if he wanted to hop on a call in three minutes with other people who wanted to buy the Constitution using ETH. He finished up the movie he was watching, hopped on the phone and decided to support the cause: he’s thrown $1,000 of his own money in so far, and currently runs the Twitter account for <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConstitutionDAO.</a></p>
<p>Unlike most DAOs, ConstitutionDAO is not token-gated, meaning that someone who joins the Discord for the community doesn’t need to have made an investment in the organization. It’s different than say, a Bored Apes Yacht Club, in which users have to be able to afford one of the pricey NFTs in order to get access to the members-only community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>”It’s been really weird,” Monteagudo said, of the momentum of the project so far &#8212; which has attracted over 19,000 members, <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1461162895547453445?t=ICtqKsM89XtymDvLAQMnkA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Grimes</a>, to join the DAO. “But I think people are excited at the prospect of raising a ton of money really quickly to mobilize action for a specific goal.”</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.xyz/ilemi/ConstitutionDAO-Funding-Tracker">Using a third-party dashboard</a>, Monteagudo estimates that 13% of contributors to ConstitutionDAO are using ETH for the first time. The same platform indicates that about 44% of people who have contributed to ConstitutionDAO have less than 40 transactions to their name.</p>
<p>The thrill of onboarding people into crypto is thus an exciting side effect of ConstitutionDAO, as theatrical as it may seem. It’s giving people a way to understand the impact and feel of a decentralized community, while also appealing to their emotions in a way that the U.S. Constitution might be able to over a work of abstract art.</p>
<p>“DAOs help large groups of people work together from all over the world. Companies can do that, but they tend to take a long time to get set up and it can be difficult to pay people across borders,” he said. “With DAOs, it’s easy to create a worldwide organization.”</p>
<p>The slew of fresh users may be exciting, but it also means that someone has the responsibility to educate the crypto-new on where their money is going &#8212; and if it’s even going to come back. Early on, for example, the ConstitutionDAO team had to change their pitch from “own a piece of the Constitution” to “you will get governance tokens” so contributors would understand exactly how their money would be spent.</p>
<p>“I just think that because the Constitution is the reason that many people &#8212; let’s say 3,000 people, have gotten into crypto, then I kind of feel responsible for making sure they do it well,” Monteagudo said</p>
<p>Upstream founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ajt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Taub</a> wants to do away with the term &#8220;DAO&#8221; altogether; instead, his company is taking a page out of the Dapper Labs book and renaming the structure to &#8220;collectives.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We’re not reinventing the wheel. Pooling money with friends has happened for a long time, paying dues with communities has happened for a long time,” Taub said. Instead, DAOs are a bet by individuals who want one of two things, the founder continued: to make money, or to gain a sense of ownership and transparency within a community. The latter piece, while more promising, feels “less researched, talked about and discussed right now.”</p>
<p>It’s part of the reason Upstream announced today that it is creating <a href="https://twitter.com/ajt/status/1461411355903279105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a platform to offer DAOs-in-a-box</a>. He envisions a world where collective members can contribute money into a shared ETH wallet, write proposals for how money should be used, vote on decisions and choose delegates to have more voting power within the community. By creating a full stack spot for people to set up DAOs, Taub thinks that there will be more clarity around governance and compliance.</p>
<p>“The Upstream collective is going to be a lot of people’s first time in a DAO and using a Metamask wallet, Ethereum and getting comfortable with it,” Taub said. “It&#8217;s a good thing in general for more people to understand the future of how money is going to move because we&#8217;ve crossed the chasm.”</p>
<p>Upstream is just one of multiple startups that have entered the fray to accelerate DAO development recently. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/08/31/investing-in-syndicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed DAO tool builder Syndicate</a> in August, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/">Utopia Labs raised $1.5 million</a> for a DAO operating system in October.</p>
<p>While groups like ConstitutionDAO embody promise for DAO proponents of the emerging structure, they are not immune to the critiques commonly leveled against new crypto technology. Some view ConstitutionDAO as just another stunt purchase, pointing out the vast number of alternative uses for the millions of dollars spent on buying the document.</p>
<p>Attention-grabbing schemes have helped people understand the power of new technologies like NFTs, but they aren’t and shouldn’t be the sole allure of crypto. That said, as it often is in the early days of a new technology, an event that appeals to those who aren’t crypto-fluent can be useful for education, albeit imperfectly so.</p>
<p>Beyond organizing to bid on rare historical documents, DAOs have a wide range of potential use cases. There are creator DAOs like Mirror that allow people to fractionally monetize their work and projects like PieDAO that use the structure to make business decisions similar to the way a corporation would. Most prominent DeFi (decentralized finance) lending platforms, like Uniswap and AAVE, are governed by DAOs.</p>
<p>Some established DAOs that launched with the purpose of making a one-off purchase have since widened their scope. PleasrDAO, for example, was originally formed to buy a Uniswap NFT artwork, but has since made inroads into DeFi and launched an incubator. Because it has gained so much traction and attracted copious resources, ConstitutionDAO could easily do the same.</p>
<p>Taub envisions potential long-term uses for DAOs that could serve the public interest &#8212; for example, in local government, where residents of cities could vote directly on how the treasury’s funds are used. But Taub also acknowledges that their newness and association with a notoriously homogenous, white, male Web3 community mean that DAOs have a long way to go.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the governance token structure underpinning many DAOs assigns voting rights based on how much money each individual has donated. ConstitutionDAO will likely sport this structure in the future, although ConstitutionDAO’s Discord chat is open to all for now. So while DAOs do provide transparency and ownership, it might be a stretch to call them democratic, as those who can’t afford larger stakes will not have the same level of say over the group’s decisions.</p>
<p>And like with other emerging Web3 technologies, DAOs facilitate huge transfers of capital with little formal oversight or regulation. Those who are attracted to the vision of community they offer may still harbor anxieties about losing their money or falling victim to fraud.</p>
<p>Joining a DAO can come with huge risks, given the regulatory grey area in which they exist today. In most U.S. states, DAOs are not governed by a concrete legal structure, so protocol developers and participants hold heightened liability compared to shareholders of regulated corporations.</p>
<p>Until these hurdles have been surmounted, DAOs are likely to center around social groups and niche communities like ConstitutionDAO rather than providing any material threat to entrenched corporate and societal structures. But once the infrastructure exists, DAOs could transform from groups of crypto-curious users buying niche items and having fun on the internet to serious collective entities that act like companies but can be more nimble and inclusive in their decision-making.</p>

I&#8217;ll be honest: I&#8217;m not the biggest Ed Sheeran fan, but the hashtag <a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-1ny4l3l r-1ddef8g r-tjvw6i r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGOxEdSheeran?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#PokemonGOxEdSheeran</a> made me laugh. So, like any self-respecting journalist, I emailed my contact at Niantic to see if he&#8217;d spill the beans (under embargo, of course).</p>
<p>He replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t share anything just yet about the Tweet, but will be sure to include you once we can!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, today, Pokémon GO announced its collaboration with Ed Sheeran. Apparently, there&#8217;s going to be an Ed Sheeran performance in-app, which we&#8217;ll learn more details about on November 22, when the event starts. For now, we know that his song &#8220;Overpass Graffiti&#8221; will play every night during the event, and there&#8217;ll be some Ed Sheeran apparel for your avatar. Pokémon GO&#8217;s celebration of&#8230; Ed Sheeran&#8230; runs through November 30, and during the event, players will encounter increased wild spawns of the water starter from the first five generations of Pokémon: Squirtle (with sunglasses!), Totodile, Mudkip, Oshawott and Froakie.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ed always chooses the Water-type Pokémon as his first partner when he starts a Pokémon RPG,&#8221; the app wrote in <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/ed-sheeran-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p>On Twitter, Pokémon GO elaborated that not only does Ed Sheeran always pick the water starter, but his favorite Pokémon is, indeed, Squirtle.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That’s not all! In celebration of Ed Sheeran’s favorite Pokémon, Squirtle wearing sunglasses will be returning to Pokémon GO! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f576.png" alt="🕶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />We might be “Thinking Out Loud,” but the thought of catching this Squirtle again feels so “Perfect” that it’s giving us “Shivers.”</p>

<p>Okay, I interned at a music PR firm for a whole three months, so let me tell you. Ed Sheeran might want you to think he&#8217;s just like us, feeling fond nostalgia for simpler times when Game Boy Color was high tech, but this dude has a whole team of publicity professionals behind him, weighing the pros and cons of his every move. This is a guy whose song &#8220;Shape of You&#8221; is the most streamed song of all time. He has resources. So, is Squirtle really Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon, or is that just a palatable fact to advertise? Squirtle is popular enough that average people can recognize it, but not as boring a pick as Pikachu. It makes sense. If you&#8217;re a PR professional and your client is revealing their favorite Pokémon, you don&#8217;t want them to say Cubone or something. Everyone knows Cubone is the most depressing Pokémon. But if they say Bouffalant, it&#8217;s like, why? Who cares?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Any serious Pokémon player knows that water types are over-powered, especially in the Kanto region. The first gym leader you face, Brock, specializes in rock-type Pokémon. Both Bulbasaur and Squirtle have super-effective moves against rock, but Charmander, a fire-type, is weak against Brock&#8217;s mighty level 14 Onix. You wanna know what&#8217;s even worse? Try battling Brock during your first-ever playthrough of Pokémon Yellow, using Pikachu&#8217;s thundershock against a rock snake. It sucks. </span></p>

<p class="containerBlock__headline">Like any good journalist waiting for an email about another story, I decided to investigate. Is Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon <em>really</em> Squirtle? Or is this just a PR ploy?</p>
<p>If you were to search &#8220;ed sheeran pokemon&#8221; right now, you would find news articles from outlets with a more robust staff than TechCrunch, which published brief news hits this morning about this unlikely, wholesome collaboration. But I wanted to go deeper. Beyond this announcement, what do we know about Ed&#8217;s Pokémon fandom? So, I narrowed my search.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2236981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="163" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=150,36 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=300,72 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=768,184 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=680,163 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.08.48-PM.png?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I discovered that two years ago, the British superstar visited <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10272069/ed-sheeran-pokemon-karaoke-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Japanese karaoke bar</a> after the Rugby World Cup final. England lost to South Africa. Brutal. He was photographed wearing both Snorlax and Charizard onesies as he sang karaoke to his own songs, which is simultaneously cringe and a power move.</p>
<p>To date, it seemed Sheeran had only acknowledged the existence of Kanto region Pokémon, or, the basic ones. This past May, Ed Sheeran posted an Instagram photo next to a large Snorlax plush, staring fondly at it like an old friend. He is wearing socks.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script></div>
<p>The following month, in June, Ed spoke with Spanish streamer Ibai Llanos. Per <a href="https://nintendohill.com/2021/07/ed-sheeran-shares-his-favourite-starter-pokemon-and-more-in-this-live-performance-with-ibai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting from Nintendo Hill</a>, Sheeran shared three insights into his Nintendo fandom: his prized possession is a Nintendo 64 GoldenEye 007 cartridge, he met the creator of Pokémon (who also wrote him a letter!), and &#8212; wait for it &#8212; his favorite Pokémon is Squirtle.</p>
<p>So, unless if Sheeran&#8217;s probably-very-skilled PR team has been planning this for at least five months (not impossible, tbh!), we can probably say that Ed Sheeran&#8217;s favorite Pokémon is really Squirtle. But also, isn&#8217;t it fun to imagine if his favorite Pokémon was something super mundane, and Pokémon GO had to develop an entire event around it? Like Burmy, Nosepass or Zigzagoon.</p>
<p>Sheeran also confirmed in that interview that the first generation of Pokémon is his favorite. Which, I mean, yeah, Ed, we can tell. However, it does seem that he has at least engaged with Pokémon content released during the twenty-first century. In 2013, he posted a photo of a cat with a Pokémon card. And what Pokémon card was it? Turtwig, a fourth-generation starter Pokémon. A grass type.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 18, 2021. Today we’re talking how audio turns into the written word and how to stop watching <em>certain</em> video content if you can’t, ahem, turn it off. But first, don’t forget that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> is coming up in just a few weeks! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/investors-bet-that-sweetgreen-will-make-sweet-amounts-of-green/"><strong>Sweetgreen’s IPO turns out pretty sweet:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Whatever you thought of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">Sweetgreen’s financial performance</a>, it is having a pretty great public debut. After pricing at $28 per share, above its target range, the company’s share price shot higher today to nearly double its starting value. Sure, you could argue that the company underpriced its public debut, but I doubt that the company is crying.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">Paytm’s IPO doesn’t:</a></strong> But while Sweetgreen is rolling in clover, Indian fintech giant Paytm had a pretty awful first day as a public company, with its shares falling around 27% in regular trading. The SoftBank- and Alibaba-backed unicorn raised $2.5 billion in its public-market debut, so it at least locked in the funds before seeing its valuation fall.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/">Spotify finally rolls out live lyrics globally:</a></strong> If you, like myself, live on Spotify but are tired of using your web browser to look up song lyrics, good news! Now you don’t have to! Lyrics are live in the music service and they look like this:</li>
</ul>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a few things to dig through from startups today, but first, Grammarly. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/grammarly-raises-200m-at-a-13b-valuation-to-make-you-an-even-better-writer-through-ai/">just raised $200 million at a $13 billion valuation</a>. This makes the company, variously, a <em>decacorn</em> or <a href="https://www.axios.com/unicorn-startup-privately-held-valued-1-billion-c64e66cb-ec22-4c68-9aaf-db7f71431704.html"><em>dragon</em></a> or <em>Company That Should Go Public</em>. Regardless, the old $1 billion valuation threshold that used to set startups apart has lost all meaning. The $10 billion mark, however, seems to be the new requirement to be a truly standout startup today.</p>
<p><strong>Notes from the TechCrunch transport desk: Cars of the future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/biliti-bets-us-market-is-primed-for-electric-tuk-tuk-deliveries/"><strong>Electric tuk tuks for the U.S. market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the play that Biliti thinks is going to be big. Tuk tuks are three-wheeled, open-cab vehicles that are something akin to a cross between a delivery van and a moped. They are popular in a number of global markets, if not the United States. But with more folks living in cities over time, and more of us expecting goods to be delivered to our homes, perhaps the time of the tuk tuk is nigh in the U.S.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/sono-motors-has-gone-public-aims-to-get-sion-solar-electric-vehicle-to-market-by-2023/"><strong>Sun power:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I don’t know how well this will work in the wild, but Sono Group just went public on the back of its solar-powered car idea. The idea is that the car can suck in enough juice from the sky to power a commute. Which means no charging cables, even if the car probably wouldn’t get you too far without other forms of electrical input. Still, the idea is very neat and we hope that all EVs in time have a solar component.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/apple-reportedly-aims-to-debut-a-fully-self-driving-car-in-2025/"><strong>Self-driving Apple:</strong></a> Remember the Apple car? Apart from the never-quite-here Apple television set, the Apple car is my favorite bit of tech from the consumer electronics giant that we have yet to set eyes on. But reporting indicates that we could see the self-driving vehicle in 2025. That’s just far enough away for us to forget about the date.</li>
<li>And speaking of self-driving, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/baidu-robotaxi-2030/"><strong>Baidu’s self-driving taxis could be in 100 cities by 2030</strong></a>. By 2030 that number better be bigger than 100, honestly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And now, a sampling of the rest of the day’s startup news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/new-app-snax-combines-short-form-movies-with-interactive-games/"><strong>What if TikTok, but also gaming?</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the idea behind Snax, which intends to bring together short-form video and interactive elements. This could be very cool, or not, probably depending on whether Snax is able to let the crowds contribute content or it decides to do all that work itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/party-round-raises-7m-to-make-the-process-of-raising-capital-less-awful/"><strong>Party Round raises its own party round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The idea behind Party Round is that raising money is a pain in the butt and that founders need better tooling. The service wants to make fundraising simpler and also allow founders to accept smaller checks. So that they can put together their own <em>party rounds</em>. Funding events with many smaller participants used to be mocked as a bad idea for founders. So much for that old logic. Party Round just added $7 million to its accounts using its own service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/mlops-startup-comet-nabs-50m-series-b-just-six-months-after-raising-its-a/"><strong>Get used to reading about MLOps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today&#8217;s news that machine learning operations startup Comet closed a $50 million Series B just months after closing its Series A might seem like just another example of a startup raising lots of money, very quickly. But recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/weights-biases-raises-new-capital-as-developer-tools-remain-a-venture-focus-ml-matures/">Weights &amp; Biases raised $135 million</a> for its own MLOps work the other week. It’s a category that is now perhaps seen as inevitable and therefore a lucrative long-term bet. Expect to see more of these investments.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/2236404/"><strong>Doorvest raises $14M to help folks buy, manage rental properties:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you want to get into real estate investing, your options set is limited today to your ability to build a small real estate company or invest in REITs. Doorvest wants to make the first option easier for folks and make itself a packet in the process.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/formstack-raises-425m-for-a-no-code-platform-that-helps-businesses-automate-their-customer-and-internal-workflows/"><strong>Workflow automation is big business:</strong></a> If you get on the horn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/how-one-startup-is-shaking-up-the-consumer-trading-boom/">with Appian CEO Matt Calkins</a>, he isn’t hard to get started on the subject of workflows. Workflows are what RPA and other automation tools, well, automate. And it’s a big enough piece of work that Appian is seeing startup competition. Formstack just raised $425 million for a no-code approach to business workflow automation, for example.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/kandji-pulls-in-100m-series-c-on-800m-valuation-up-10x-since-last-year/"><strong>MDM is investor catnip:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News out today that Kandji has raised $100 million at an $800 million valuation for its Apple device management business might not raise your eyebrows, but recall that Apple itself is getting in on the game and that Jamf, another competitor, already went public. Perhaps Apple’s corporate footprint is simply larger than we thought.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/remojo-gets-funding-to-help-men-quit-porn/">This startup wants to help you stop watching porn:</a></strong> If you’ve spent too much time online in the last while, you have at least heard of certain movements among the digitally inclined to stop consuming pornography. Now that porn is free and easily accessible, as opposed to costly and served in physical formats, some folks are overindulging. Enter Remojo, which wants to help men quit the media variety altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And, finally, accessibility:</strong></p>

<li>Watching <a href="https://accessible.substack.com/">micro-publications with a focus on technology accessibility</a> get off the ground has brought the topic back to the front of my mind. Which is why news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/clubhouse-live-captions-on-ios/">that Clubhouse is bringing live captions to iOS caught my eye</a>. It’s a good move, and one that we hope becomes table stakes for audio platforms moving forward.</li>

<p>Dear Sophie,</p>
<p>I run operations at an early-stage startup, and I’ve been tasked with hiring and other HR responsibilities. I’m feeling out of my depth with hiring and trying to figure out visa issues for prospective hires.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/dear-sophie-any-advice-on-visa-issues-for-new-hires/">Do you have any advice?</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://workday.com">Workday</a> announced this afternoon that it intends to acquire <a href="http://vndly.com">VNDLY</a>, a Mason, OH startup that helps companies manage external workforce personnel for $510 million.</p>
<p>Workday helps companies manage finance and human resources tasks, and VNDLY fits nicely into the latter category providing them with software to manage contractors, a service that should come in handy at a time where it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to fill full time job openings.</p>
<p>Pete Schlampp, chief strategy officer at Workday, says as the face of work changes, companies need a way to manage contractors and VNDLY gives them that. Folding that capability into the Workday platform expands their capabilities with an offering that customers will need in the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;VNDLY is at the forefront of the vendor management industry with an innovative and intuitive approach. The powerful combination of our technologies and talent will help customers better manage their evolving workforce dynamics, helping them keep pace with today’s changing world of work,&#8221; Schlampp said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bringing the two companies together means that customers can manage internal and external workers from the same interface, saving HR personnel from switching context based on worker type. In addition, customers will be able to plan for workforce needs, regardless of the type, while managing internal and external compliance and risk requirements related to this type of worker.</p>
<p>The two companies were not strangers to each other as VNDLY lists Workday as an integration partner on its website. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter next year, which corresponds with Workday&#8217;s Q4 2022 ending on 1/31/2022.</p>
<p>VNDLY is based in Mason, Ohio, and it marks the latest exit for a Midwest startup. Other big Midwest exits include Salesforce buying Indianapolis-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">ExactTarget for $2.5 billion</a> in 2013 and Cisco buying Ann Arbor, MI-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/">Duo for $2.35 billion</a> in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 and raised almost $58 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data. The company&#8217;s largest and most recent round was<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vndly-raises-35-million-in-series-b-funding-led-by-insight-partners-300975581.html"> a $35 million Series B</a> at the end of 2019 led by Insight Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new economy of space has been made possible by the new generation of launch companies — the <em>old</em> new generation now, actually, as SpaceX and Rocket Lab cement their reputations. Now it&#8217;s up to the likes of Astra, Firefly Aerospace, Relativity Space and Launcher to change the game — as the CEOs of those companies will explain at our virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> event on December 14-15.</p>
<p>These companies all have very different approaches to the orbital launch services industry. <a href="https://launcherspace.com/">Launcher</a> is focusing on efficiency, for instance, with a 3D-printed copper liquid engine that it says is among the most fuel-efficient out there. Lower costs, less fuel per launch and subsequently more space for payloads mean it can undercut competitors in the increasingly competitive small launch market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a>, on the other hand, intends to lower costs by making the launch vehicles as cheap as possible and throwing caution to the wind. Launching from Kodiak, Alaska and brazenly accepting a higher risk per launch, Astra&#8217;s philosophy is that demand will soon be so great that speed and convenience will grow in value, and its portable launch vehicle will be ready.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/firefly-aerospace-raises-75m-series-a-at-a-1b-valuation-plus-100m-in-secondary-sale/">Firefly Aerospace</a> has a larger launch vehicle that can take up to 1,000 kg to orbit and has begun diversifying as well. A $93 million NASA contract for an upcoming mission to the lunar surface shows that the company has escaped its complicated past and is ready to become a major new force in the industry in the Artemis Era.</p>
<p>First, of course, they have to get to orbit — as difficult a task as it ever was, but one that each company is progressing toward at their own pace. The CEOs of all three companies — Max Haot from Launcher, Benjamin Lyon from Astra and Lauren Lyons from Firefly — will be on stage with us to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the new launch (and funding) ecosystem in detail.</p>
<p>Lastly but certainly not least, we have Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, coming to TC Sessions: Space as well. Growing quickly and putting satellites into orbit by the dozen, Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron is an established presence in launch but only the first step in Beck&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/peter-beck-says-rocket-lab-actively-prepared-for-interplanetary-missions-from-day-one/">long-planned expansion</a> into larger launch vehicles, satellite design and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">Get your pass</a>, join your global space community and get the very latest thinking on space launch systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (previously known as Extra Crunch Live) is ending the year strong with a slate of fantastic speakers. We&#8217;re speaking to Eugenio Pace from AuthO and Sunil Nagaraj from Ubiquity Ventures. Then, our last show of 2021 will feature Alyson Watson from Modern Health and investor Annie Case from Kleiner Perkins.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled with the response to TechCrunch Live. Over the last year, we&#8217;ve had great speakers telling amazing stories of growth, exits and failure. Just recently, Laela Sturdy and Vlad Magdalin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/mixing-the-personal-with-the-professional-in-startup-fundraising/">spoke on mixing the personal with the professional</a> in startup fundraising. Aileen Lee and Rachel Carlson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/aileen-lee-and-rachel-carlson-walk-through-guild-educations-early-pitch-deck/">walked through Guild Education&#8217;s early pitch deck</a> and we learned how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/how-lunchclub-landed-a-preemptive-term-sheet-from-lightspeed/">Lunchclub landed a preemptive term sheet</a> from Lightspeed.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is specifically designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, specifically, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision, and their step-by-step plan to getting there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235691" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this — complete with a look at these companies’ early pitch decks, and more — on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3pm ET, and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven’t yet already, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/subscribe">sign up now</a>!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in December.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joann Wu, a longtime LinkedIn executive who spent over a decade at the company working on user experience and product design, is moving to Uber. She will be joining Uber as VP of product design starting January 3, where she’ll report to Chief Product Officer Sundeep Jain.</p>
<p>Wu told TechCrunch that she&#8217;s a longtime user of both Uber and Uber Eats, the company&#8217;s food delivery business unit. &#8220;I see Uber as a platform that can make it easy to do both — &#8216;go&#8217; and &#8216;get,&#8217; and there&#8217;s a lot we can do with design around doing those two things really, really well every day and make people&#8217;s lives a little bit easier.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236836" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236836" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236836 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?w=593" alt="Joann Wu " width="593" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png 836w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=768,880 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=593,680 593w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Joannwu.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236836" class="wp-caption-text">Joann Wu. <strong>Image Credits: </strong>Uber</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wu started at LinkedIn as a senior UX designer in content and publishing, and held a variety of roles throughout her tenure, including senior director of product design. In March 2021 she took over as VP of product design, where she headed LinkedIn’s global consumer product design team. She led the redesign of LinkedIn&#8217;s website and mobile app, built LinkedIn News and launched the LinkedIn Publishing Platform.</p>
<p>While she was at LinkedIn, the platform grew from around 100 million users nearly 800 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Design is the bridge between humans and technology,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Great experience will transfer users&#8217; intent into action and bring value to their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber is constantly rolling out or piloting new features &#8212; like being able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/uber-pilots-new-features-to-reserve-rides-at-airports/">reserve a car</a> at an airport or adding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uber-eats-adds-map-feature-so-users-can-find-nearest-restaurants-for-pickup/">a new mapping function</a> to its Eats business unit &#8212; so Wu will surely be busy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>The story has been corrected to reflect that Linked in has nearly, not over, 800 million users</em>.</p>
