										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Baidu keeps ramping up its autonomous driving ambitions. The Chinese tech company made its name in search engines and still relies greatly on search ads for revenues. But it&#8217;s hoping that its heavy bet on autonomous driving will pay off down the road.</p>
<p>Apollo Go, Baidu&#8217;s robotaxi service, aims to be in 65 cities by 2025 and 100 cities by 2030, the firm&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Robin Li said on an<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/17/baidu-inc-bidu-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> analyst call Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big batch of licenses that Baidu needs to obtain from local regulators. And eventually, the business&#8217;s sustainability comes down to how many of these permits grant commercial operations to Apollo Go, and how many rides the service could actually garner.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, Li estimated that Baidu is &#8220;probably the largest robotaxi service provider in the world by number of rides.&#8221; In the third quarter alone, Baidu offered 115,000 rides, and Li expected the number for Q4 to be &#8220;much larger than the reported number you can hear anywhere else in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of improving its driving tech, Baidu has so far racked up over 16 million kilometers (10 million miles) of L4, self-driven distance. That&#8217;s up from<a href="https://ir.baidu.com/static-files/da8a09d2-6994-4011-8c4b-7526749689f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 6.2 million miles</a> reporterd in its first-quarter results.</p>
<p>These enormous figures, however, have limited substance unless we know how many of these rides actually happen on busy city roads rather than designated routes in enclosed areas.</p>
<p>Like most autonomous vehicle companies in China, Baidu is carving out a commercial robotaxi operation while supplying its advanced driving assistance tech to automakers and OEMs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Baidu has been providing driving solutions to auto companies via its <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-auto/inside-apollo-6-0-a-road-towards-fully-driverless-technology-522b2b4295cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-sourced Apollo platform</a> since 2017. While the platform has accumulated hundreds of enterprise users, Baidu has fostered closer ties with certain partners. For example, it set up a joint venture with China&#8217;s Geely to form electric vehicle maker Jidu Auto, into which the partners would plow <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-baidus-auto-venture-invest-77-bln-into-smart-cars-over-next-five-years-2021-04-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion)</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, the popular auto-editing tool for writing, has raised $200 million in funding at a $13 billion valuation from new investors including Baillie Gifford and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, among others. The company plans to use the investment to accelerate product innovation and team growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this funding round is a great validation of our business strength,&#8221; Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, Grammarly&#8217;s global head of product, told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been cash flow positive from the very early days. The round also validates the strength of our mission to improve lives through improving communication. This funding round comes in the context of product innovation and product scaling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy-Chowdhury says Grammarly plans to use the funding to continue making investments in its AI technology. The company will also continue to advance its natural language processing and machine learning tech to deliver personalized communication feedback to its users. Roy-Chowdhury also noted that Grammarly plans to make additional investments to earn and strengthen user trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, I see so much potential because, at the end of the day, it always comes back to our mission of improving communication. There&#8217;s so much change in how work gets done with remote-first global teams trying to work together. We see a huge opportunity to help people with these changing scenarios communicate more effectively. This new funding is only going to help us accelerate our efforts to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s vision for the future of the service, Roy-Chowdhury noted that Grammarly will move past simply focusing on conciseness, consistency, and correctness. The company plans to add new categories in which to offer suggested improvements, while also working to become more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Grammarly is already scaling its product offerings and achieving its goal towards ubiquity with the launch of <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/introducing-grammarly-for-mac-windows">Grammarly for Mac and Windows</a> earlier this week. The new desktop application can be used on apps such as Microsoft Office, Slack, Discord, Jira, and more. Roy-Chowdhury says the new desktop app aims to be users&#8217; go-to writing tool wherever they type, as the service is now able to break out of technical barriers associated with browser extensions.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Grammarly for Mac and Windows, we can now tie everything together and help you with the entirety of your communication flow. With this, we are present everywhere you communicate and can help you achieve your outcomes more effectively,&#8221; Roy-Chowdhury stated.</p>
<p>Grammarly also recently announced the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/grammarly-sdk-beta-lets-developers-embed-text-editing-into-any-web-app/">Grammarly for Developers </a>with the rollout of its Text Editor SDK (software development kit), which enables programmers to embed Grammarly text editing functionality into any web application. The beta release of this SDK gives developers access to the full power of Grammarly automated editing with a couple of lines of code. Although users of the target application don’t need to be Grammarly customers, if they do happen to be, they can log into their Grammarly accounts and access all of the functionality that comes with that.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest funding round follows Grammarly&#8217;s previous one in October 2019, when it raised $90 million at a valuation of over $1 billion. This round was led by General Catalyst, which had also helped lead its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/grammarly-raises-110-million-for-a-better-spell-check/"> only other round, for $110 million in May 2017</a>, with participation from previous investor IVP and other unnamed backers.</p>
<p>Today, Grammarly works across more than 500,000 applications and websites including email clients, enterprise software, and word processors. The company says as more people are connecting across more online platforms, it&#8217;s important to get communication right in order to achieve individual and business goals, which is what it aims to help its users accomplish.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span>As the world has digitized, people communicate more than they ever have—yet it has never been so difficult,” said Peter Singlehurst, head of private companies at Baillie Gifford, in a statement. “Grammarly is one of the few businesses in the world focused on solving this problem. What attracted us is the company’s vision and the team’s ability to drive the product forward to help more people in more situations communicate better. Grammarly’s long-term and ambitious approach also aligns with our approach to investing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grammarly operates on a freemium model, where paid tiers give users more tools beyond grammar and spelling checks to include things like word choice, sentence rewrites, tone adjustments, fluency, formality level, and plagiarism detection. The paid tiers are priced at <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/upgrade?utm_campaign=funnelPremiumPlanComparison&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_source=funnel">$12, $20, and $30 per month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab’s reusability program advanced one more step on Wednesday night when the company recovered the booster from its Electron launcher for the third time.</p>
<p>The successful mission comes after a period of delays due to weather, but all went according to plan, with the “Love at First Insight” mission taking off at 8:39 PM EST from the company’s launch facility on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. Separation occurred at around 8:41 PM EST and the first stage splashing down at around 9:24 PM EST, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Peter_J_Beck/status/1461158303283642373">a tweet from Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice in its history – the only other company besides SpaceX to achieve reusability. The first successful recovery took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">November 2020</a> and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in the destruction of the payload.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like those flights, this booster made a splashdown via parachute. But the recovery included an additional element: the presence of a helicopter, which hovered near the splashdown area to track and observe the booster as it made its descent. While the helicopter didn’t actually do anything related to the recovery, its presence is significant, as it indicates that Rocket Lab is also a step closer to executing its ultimate reusability plan: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster and capturing it mid-air with a helicopter.</p>
<p>The Electron sent two BlackSky Earth geospatial imaging satellites to low Earth orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement on behalf of BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. These satellites were originally scheduled to go to LEO in August, part of a three-launch schedule that ended up being delayed due to a small resurgence of the coronavirus in New Zealand and subsequent lockdown measures.</p>
<p>The two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, as the geospatial intelligence company’s aims to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">were lost due to a significant anomaly</a> that occurred shortly after the Electron’s second-stage ignited.</p>
<p>This mission marks Rocket Lab’s twenty-second Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team of Google executives, many of whom worked with one another for years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/next-billion-users-head-caesar-sengupta-is-leaving-google/">left the company earlier this year</a> to launch a startup. The fintech firm, Arbo Works, has raised a financing round led by Sequoia Capital India, the two said Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="http://arbo.works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arbo Works</a>, spearheaded by Caesar Sengupta, said on Thursday 120 angel investors, many from Google, participated in the seed financing round. &#8220;This group includes CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, founders of successful startups, senior executives from tech and financial institutions, and deep practitioners of AI and ML,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup isn’t disclosing the size of the round, but two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that it’s an eight-figure investment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sengupta, who previously led Google’s Next Billion Users program and is pictured above, told TechCrunch in an interview that the funds give Arbo Works runway for several years. “It’s a very significant round,” he said.</p>
<p>Arbo Works has eight co-founders, all of whom previously worked at Google. In fact, on its website, Arbo Works has listed 21 teammates, 20 of whom previously worked at Google (and many worked on the company’s payments product).</p>
<p>“We all have enjoyed working with each other. It sounds weird to say this, but I would continue to work with them anywhere, even if it is selling bananas,” he said laughingly. “Even as Google is a large company, a lot of this group formed around Sundar (Pichai, the company&#8217;s chief executive), working on Chrome OS. The group stayed together; in fact, many moved to Asia when I came here,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236216" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236216" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236216 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=300,90 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=768,230 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=680,204 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=1536,460 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=2048,613 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236216" class="wp-caption-text">Arbo Works team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arbo Works</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what is Arbo, which has set up headquarters in Singapore and the U.S., working on? Sengupta is hesitant to share just yet. But he offered some context around the opportunity the startup sees. Sengupta, who worked and launched peer-to-peer payments app Tez in India, said the startup has identified an open space in the world of consumer finance.</p>
<p>“We think the general world of finance itself can be dramatically improved. With payments, we are seeing a sliver of that getting reinvented, but when you think about your money, the consumer experience there has a lot to be developed. It’s a new space in consumer finance. We want to bring great consumer experiences with deep tech,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are starting with the U.S. market, because the space we are going after is more open there,” he said. “But we are building a global product. We will bring it to India fairly soon.”</p>
<p>Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia India, said Arbo Works has chosen a &#8220;massive unsolved problem in the global fintech space.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Caesar and team are uniquely accomplished in having built multiple cutting-edge products that are used by billions of internet users on the planet. It’s rare that a team with such achievements will join forces to startup. Similar to many other consumer fintech companies we have backed, this one also requires a more user-centric approach, a more delightful user experience and a more seamless and scalable platform than likely exists today. Team Sequoia India and I could not be more grateful to be a part of this journey and join forces with the dozens of ultra talented Arbonauts that are assembling to pursue a very inspiring mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Sengupta why he couldn’t build what Arbo Works is attempting to create within Google.</p>
<p>“Large companies are a different kind of beast,” he said. “We are product builders. I want to build products rather than deal with complex partner issues, external regulators, political issues. Google is such an iconic company now that it can’t take one step without six people externally having six different opinions.”</p>
<p>“We left [Google] on a very, very friendly note. Sundar is more than a mentor or boss … he is a brother to me and he is always going to stay that way. I owe so much of my life to him,” he said. Has Pichai invested in Arbo Works? Sengupta declined to comment, but said many Google leaders have backed the startup.</p>
<p>Arbo Works is beginning to hire more people and is looking to recruit those who are focused on building a product with a long-term focus and share <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10THTYtuwKCnkqymc4UeLXcB3xhR8sr-RAQ08IqdwN94/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar sensibilities</a>. &#8220;We want people who want to work with amazing people and build something that when they&#8217;re 70 years old, they can look back and say they played a role in building it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has been advancing the development of Starship, the largest ultra-super-heavy reusable launch system ever designed in history, at a jaw-dropping pace — and CEO Elon Musk is “comfortable” it will reach orbit sometime next year.</p>
<p>Musk made the comments — which often veered into the philosophical — at the National Academies’ first virtual joint fall meeting of the Space Studies Board and the Board on Physics and Astronomy. The talk, titled simply “SpaceX Starship Discussion,” and subsequent Q&amp;A session gave Musk the opportunity to respond to questions from Academy members on the next-gen system’s technical and operational details.</p>
<p>Musk is aiming for SpaceX to complete work on the launch pad and launch tower at Starbase, the company’s sprawling facility in Boca Chica, Texas, later this month, with the first orbital launch set for January 2022. That would be followed by possibly a dozen additional launches, possibly more, throughout the rest of 2022, Musk said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That doesn’t mean Starship will reach orbit in January, however, as Musk was careful to note. “There’s a lot of risk associated with this first launch,” he said. “So I would not say that it is likely to be successful, but I think we will make a lot of progress.”</p>
<p>The other major barrier to a January launch is regulatory approval. SpaceX’s launch activities at Starbase are currently undergoing an environmental assessment with the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said earlier this week that it would wrap up that review by December 31, so if all goes according to Musk&#8217;s plans, a January launch is the earliest feasible date.</p>
<p>Musk also estimated it could start selling Starship launches at prices cheaper than the Falcon 9 in around two years, which are even earlier than the timeline part of SpaceX’s proposal for NASA’s Human Landing System. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">SpaceX won the sole bid</a> to develop the HLS, which will transport humans to the moon for the first time since the days of the Apollo program, for NASA’s Artemis program. That launch, dubbed Artemis 3, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">now scheduled to launch in 2025</a>.)</p>
<h2>Starship is moving fast</h2>
<p>It’s hard to overstate the scale of Starship, which includes the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket, compared to all other launch systems in history. Fully assembled, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/spacex-stacks-the-full-starship-launch-system-for-the-first-time-standing-nearly-400-feet-tall/">it stands 394 feet tall</a> (by comparison, NASA’s in-development Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft is 322 feet fully stacked). Starship could have the capacity to repeatedly launch more than 100 tons into orbit and function as what Musk described as “a generalized transport mechanism for the greater solar system.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Musk isn’t aiming to build one, or two, or even 10 Starships; instead, he estimated during the talk that humanity may need around 1,000 launch systems to make life truly multiplanetary. And SpaceX has built a factory to mass manufacture them — or as close to mass manufacturing as you could get.</p>
<p>And the company has been moving fast on its development. Back in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">SpaceX flew the 15th prototype of Starship</a>, and the launch vehicle reached around 30,000 feet with a successful upright landing. It was the first time a test concluded with the launch vehicle intact.</p>
<p>“The overarching goal of SpaceX has been to advance space technology such that humanity can become a multiplanet species and ultimately, a spacefaring civilization, and to make true the things that we read about in science fiction, and have them not always be fiction,” he told National Academies&#8217; members.</p>
<p>“I think this is very important for the long-term preservation of the light of consciousness.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world of copycat companies and investment firms that also increasingly operate in similar ways, Jack Abraham stands out a bit.</p>
<p>His venture firm, <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic</a>, only writes checks to startups it spins up itself. It&#8217;s launching a <em>lot</em> of startups, too. Since founding and selling a company called Milo to eBay in 2010 at the age of 24, Abraham has co-founded dozens of companies with Atomic in recent years. Among them: the tele-health company Hims &amp; Hers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/">went public</a> last year through a blank-check company; Bungalow, an online marketplace for residential real estate that closed on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/bungalow-valuation-soars-over-600-million-as-deer-park-invests?sref=gni836kR">$75 million in funding</a> at a post-money valuation of $600 million in August; and OpenStore, an eight-month-old startup that acquires e-commerce businesses that sell on Shopify and which just today announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea">$75 million in fresh funding</a> in a deal that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea">reportedly</a> values the company at $750 million.</p>
<p>Altogether, Atomic has produced 14 companies over the last 12 months, and that&#8217;s on top of nine that it formed the year earlier. Notably, it has done this with not enormous amounts of funding (it closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million/">$260 million fund</a> earlier this year). Atomic doesn&#8217;t have a sprawling team, either, though it has made some <a href="https://atomic.vc/blog/#your-co-founding-team">key hires</a> recently that bring its headcount to 50. (It was previously run by roughly 15 people.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Little wonder that traditional venture firms are starting to wonder if Abraham might be on to something. To get insight into his playbook for their benefit &#8212; and our own &#8212;  we sat down with him late <a href="https://strictlyvcinsf.splashthat.com/">last week</a> while he was in town from Miami, where he relocated from the Bay Area last year. Excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity follow. (You can also catch the full conversation below.)</p>

<p><strong>TC: With valuations soaring so high, so fast, more and more VCs are talking about incubating companies in order to own more for a lot less capital. For their benefit, how is the sausage made at Atomic?</strong></p>
<p>JA: I think in reality, it&#8217;s actually pretty difficult to do venture capital and building companies at the same time. You see some firms doing it, where partners might start a company once every two years or three years, and that&#8217;s because when you&#8217;re operating in venture capital, you&#8217;re in a receiving mode. You&#8217;re getting so much email, you&#8217;re getting deal flow, your job is to source, you&#8217;re in meetings all the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Atomic, we show up every day and play offense with our cofounders to build companies. We&#8217;ve also really worked on scaling up our team [including to bring in experts in marketing, finance, healthcare, and recruiting because] you have to build a team of builders to be able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have a billion dollar fund; how do you pay for all that headcount? </strong></p>
<p>A lot of venture capital funds take the fees from the fund and distribute them just to the partners. We&#8217;re really trying to invest in our team to grow the team and support our companies. We have an amazing legal team at Atomic, for example, and rather than get billed $1,200 for talking to someone at a corporate law firm, we have someone who is equal to them who will get charged that cost to the company. There are some resources that are billed at utilization based on how much our companies use them, but completely at cost, and that helps offset some of the costs of those services where our companies might have spent that money elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_lZAWf0hS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;e also saving money obviously by building companies in house and thus avoiding paying a lot for small stake in someone else&#8217;s startup. How do you generate an idea, and how do you think about Atomic&#8217;s ownership percentage over time?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re strong believers that it&#8217;s much better to observe problems in the world and come up with solutions for them … rather than doing brainstorming exercises. Sometimes those can lead to contrived ideas. So we try really hard across our portfolio to find patterns of things that are broken, problems that exist in industries we operate in, where whitespaces could exist, and note those problems. And we now have a list of well over 600 different company ideas that we can draw from. And we have a process for whittling those ideas down, testing them, getting smarter about them them, engaging experts and ultimately choosing which of them we want to build.</p>
<p>One advantage of our model [is] proprietary deal flow. Every company we create, our LPs get to invest in at predefined ownership levels. So by the time our companies come out and raise from venture capitalists, the ownership levels are much higher than most investors would have, which gives us room to play around with other investors and bring them in. We like collaborating with people. We have a lot of repeat customers that like working with us. We&#8217;re happy to be good citizens and figure out the right way to make that work.</p>
<p><strong>It looks from past deals that Founders Fund is one of them. You even co-founded a company this year with Keith Rabois called OpenStore. Before we get to that, I wanted to ask about telemedicine. Atomic&#8217;s first big hit was Hims, which came together in anticipation of ED drug patents expiring, making it possible to sell generic versions. I wonder how replicable that model is and how closely you&#8217;re tracking the many other drugs falling off the patent cliff. Could those be 50 of the 600 business ideas?</strong></p>
<p>[Hims was created in part from] an observation around &#8220;How do you find painful things people are suffering from, and get them treated online for [that condition]?&#8221; And &#8220;are there medications that are underpenetrated that could help those conditions?&#8221; … rather than some master strategy of observing when all drugs are coming off of patent and then tracking them all and seeing what we could build businesses off of. There are still a lot of opportunities in that space, but no, they do not comprise 50 of the 600 ideas.</p>
<p><strong>You have a wide range of companies. Do you think in terms of sectors?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, in building Atomic, a lot of people told me, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you specialize? Why don&#8217;t you just do one kind of company? Why don&#8217;t you just do e-commerce companies, for example?&#8221; In some ways that would be a lot easier, right? You can build common infrastructure, you can rinse and repeat, and everything can be cookie cutter. [But] Marc Andreessen is one of our investors, and he told me when I was starting Atomic that there are 15 companies that are produced each year that matter.</p>
<p>The odds that those big ideas are going to occur in the same sector over and over again is very, very low. So by definition, we chose to be agnostic. And that has led us into basically everything: healthcare, fintech, education, proptech, commerce, AI, SaaS, consumer products. Nothing is off limits for us. Nothing really scares us. And the world&#8217;s changing so quickly that I actually think you need to have that mindset to catch the next big thing.</p>
<p><strong>How do you find &#8212; and financially motivate &#8212; the founders who you need to lead these companies?</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways that we go about it. We can either start with the person or the people, or we can start with the idea. In the case where we&#8217;re starting with the person or people, we just want to work with them as an individual. We&#8217;re kind of totally agnostic to the idea. So we&#8217;re just like, &#8220;We&#8217;ll work on anything with you. Let&#8217;s find something that we&#8217;re both excited about, and let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221; We&#8217;ll also form companies sometimes where we start with the idea and we build the company up to millions of dollars of revenue, and then bring in the perfect person to run it, and we&#8217;ll still make them a co-founder and we still want to give them a huge amount of equity because we want them to be incentivized but based on where they&#8217;re coming in and how much value they&#8217;re adding that equity split can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve founded many more companies than are listed on your website. Are some operating in stealth mode?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Unfortunately, with some of the success comes copycats. And some of our companies that we&#8217;ve launched, we&#8217;ve had people in other studios literally rip off everything down to the fonts, the copy, the photos, the ad units, the messages in the ads, the pricing, everything. So we kind of have to keep our companies stealth because otherwise people will just copy them early on.</p>
<p>Now that we have a large fund and we can fund the company long enough where it can kind of hopefully hit escape velocity, we would like to do that and then bring it out to market and make it more public once it&#8217;s really hard to copy and it&#8217;s really working and scaling. So we have a few dozen companies that we&#8217;ve started at this point of which maybe half are public and half are still in stealth and crossing that chasm period where they&#8217;re growing, they&#8217;re accelerating, but we just don&#8217;t want to run into those situations if we can avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like you are more involved with OpenStore than other companies. Why?</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235966" style="width: 2057px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235966" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235966 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett</p></div></p>
<p>Keith [Rabois] and I have a great history. Keith was an investor in my first company, Milo. I&#8217;ve known him forever. I think the world of him, and I had this idea for OpenStore [because] there&#8217;s no liquidity for merchants that are creating e-commerce stores outside of Amazon. There are a lot of companies that are buying companies within Amazon. But if you&#8217;re a merchant on Shopify or any of these other players in the ecosystem, there tends to be no one who will acquire your company. You have to first cross a massive chasm and maybe get to $50 million in revenue before you get any offers like that.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this big liquidity gap in that market, and with OpenStore, we built a website that&#8217;s kind of like [the residential real estate company] Opendoor [which Rabois also co-founded] where you can [plug] in your house and get an offer. With OpenStore, you can [provide it] with your store, information on your store, [and] just your Shopify login, and we will underwrite your business and actually give you an offer that same day to sell your company. And we think it can totally change the game in that space. And Keith and I [share the vision] of how big OpenStore can become.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I was more involved with that one is it was being built at my house, so I literally couldn&#8217;t escape it. It was in the downstairs area, and it was all hours of the day. Eventually, my girlfriend told me that had to stop [laughs], and we stopped that, but now we have our own office and the company&#8217;s doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Any Web3 type ideas percolating?</strong></p>
<p>I think Web3 is a massive opportunity … I think the thing you have to be a little bit careful about with Web3 is it&#8217;s one thing to be an investor in Web3 and it&#8217;s another thing to be a builder because the laws are kind of gray in the United States. And we always want to be careful around that. I think it&#8217;s a little bit easier to create a company with equity than create something in pure crypto. [So] we will be doing that more; it&#8217;s just a question of the degree of our going to do it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 17, 2021! The tech world was abuzz today with news that a crypto startup was buying the naming rights to a stadium that was previously named after an office supply company. You can read that as crypto getting mature or 2021 losing the plot. Regardless, we have lots to talk about! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Apple will now let you fix your own gadgets:</a> </strong>We’re surprised but stoked by news that Apple announced a “new program designed to let users perform common repairs on devices at home.” It’s called Self Service Repair, and, frankly, it’s a bit weird to digest such consumer-friendly news from a megacorp.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/waymo-via-expands-ups-partnership-to-include-autonomous-freight-with-class-8-trucks/"><strong>Waymo extrends freight partnership:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Given how lovely it would be to live in a world where cars would drive us instead of the other way around, I am paying close attention to self-driving news of all sorts. Today’s update that parcel-delivery concern UPS and Alphabet’s Waymo division are extending their partnership was therefore right up my alley.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/unicorns-braze-and-usertesting-begin-public-life-in-diverging-ways/"><strong>Braze, UserTesting go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>There were <em>two</em> unicorn IPOs today. Braze, a customer engagement software company, and UserTesting, which does what it says on the tin. TechCrunch dug into their respective IPO prices and economics to celebrate. We also caught up with Braze’s CEO, but more on that later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into <em>startup</em> news, let’s talk about some unicorns. Instacart’s growth rate is reportedly slowing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">TechCrunch wondering if its rivals are nibbling on its market share</a>. Instacart, worth tens of billions of dollars, is an obvious 2022 IPO candidate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236018" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/alltrails-raises-150m-after-covid-accelerates-peoples-interest-in-exploring-the-outdoors/"><strong>Tech company makes money on “outside:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>Depending on where you are in the world today, going outside might sound like a lark or like sheer drudgery. But no matter, because the business of helping people get outside is booming. AllTrails just banked $150 million for its work in helping walkers and bikers and hikers get out and, well, about.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/jiko-announces-partnership-to-a-launch-banking-app-for-the-transgender-community/"><strong>Niche neobanks continue to raise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Building a neobank tuned for one part of the population or another is an increasingly popular activity. The gist is that building a basic banking service is not <em>that</em> hard in 2021, given the number of off-the-shelf parts. This means that we can have more &#8212; and more specific &#8212; digital banks. For example, Jiko is partnering with Euphoria, “a technology suite for the transgender community that helps alleviate the struggles associated with gender transition, to launch a banking app called Bliss.” I dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/with-new-tech-and-3-6m-seed-divigas-aims-to-clean-up-hydrogen-production/"><strong>DiviGas raises $3.6M to clean up hydrogen production:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With a new method of hydrogen diversion under its belt, DiviGas says that it has raised money to keep up with customer demand for its “hollow fiber polymeric membrane” technology. Keep an eye on this company in case it really has cracked a notable tech issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/in-game-creation-platform-overwolf-raises-75m-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/"><strong>Overwolf raises huge capital to help you make in-game content:</strong></a> If you play a game that has a serious modding community, you’re aware that not only big studios can make neat stuff for games. Regular folks can, too. Overwolf, which wants to help individuals make items for games, just raised $75 million for its work. The company’s round is a bet on gaming &#8212; and creators themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-anoma-protocol-raises-26m-for-its-work-to-undefine-money/"><strong>The group building the Anoma protocol raises $26M:</strong></a> Skipping all the technical details, the Anoma protocol will launch in around a year and will allow for individuals to trade digital assets without using money as an intermediary. It’s a ways off, but the tech sounds rather cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/autonomous-tractor-maker-monarch-raises-61-million/"><strong>Monarch crowns itself with second funding round in less than a year:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It turns out that the market for autonomous electric agricultural tractors is booming. Monarch raised $20 million earlier this year and just added $61 million more to its accounts. With labor in short supply, the company may have found the perfect time for its four-wheeled creation.</li>

<h2>4 strategies for setting marketplace take rates</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2235649" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/4-strategies-for-setting-marketplace-take-rates/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235649" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235649 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg" alt="People handing over money" width="1024" height="742" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg 2034w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=1536,1113 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-88622588.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.in/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Image+Source" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>E-commerce platform founders may be tempted to set transaction fees just a little higher than they initially planned, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/4-strategies-for-setting-marketplace-take-rates/">greed isn&#8217;t always good. </a></p>
<p>Boosting take rates by a point or two could boost early revenue when it&#8217;s needed most, but there&#8217;s an opportunity cost, since &#8220;a higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume,&#8221; according to angel investor and product manager Tanay Jaipuria.</p>
<p>Take rates should directly reflect the stage of your business, he advises, since platforms with higher rates see lower transaction volumes. To learn how different companies use this lever, Jaipura studied take rates for more than 25 marketplaces, including Apple, Shutterstock and OpenSea.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal,&#8221; he says.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/"><strong>Instagram to shutter ‘Threads:&#8217;</strong></a><strong> </strong>Meta launched Threads after it killed Direct, the preceding, standalone Instagram messaging app. Now Threads is heading to the grave. Perhaps Meta is working to become a bit more like Google in its ability to whack existing messaging products.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end/"><strong>Spotify takes paid podcasts global:</strong></a> Music giant Spotify’s efforts to bring paid subscriptions to the podcast world took another step today with the European company announcing that it is bringing the tool to the world. I don’t know if paid shows will catch on, but last I checked my TechCrunch contract doesn’t provide me with a cut of revenues from Equity, so don’t expect us to jump aboard any time soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/apple-google-get-ico-questions-on-app-age-ratings/"><strong>The U.K. has questions concerning how Apple, Google determine app age ratings:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Of late, it’s hard to find a week in which U.S. tech giants are not in some sort of European hot water. Perhaps they should take a trip to Bath to sort out their issues. I kid, but this time the U.K. really does seem quite curious.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazons-ridiculously-large-echo-show-15-arrives-december-9/"><strong>What if Amazon made an Echo, but <em>HUGE?</em></strong></a> Well, it has. And you can buy the gigantic Show 15 with its nearly 16-inch screen for the holidays. I don’t know why you would want to give Amazon an even <em>larger</em> screen with which to harass you with toothpaste ads, but here we are.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook, errr Meta, showed off a new prototype haptic feedback glove yesterday, which they detailed could eventually bring a new generation of AR/VR users closer than they&#8217;ve ever been to digital content. Today, a VR startup with that same mission called <a href="https://haptx.com/">HaptX</a> (which we&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/haptx-grabs-12-million-to-build-a-glove-crammed-with-sensors/">here</a> before) released a fairly aggressive statement accusing Meta of showing off a prototype that was &#8220;substantively identical&#8221; to their own patented technology.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://haptx.com/meta-glove-prototype-response/">statement</a> from HaptX CEO Jake Rubin further detailed that his startup has shown off their technology over the years to &#8220;many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta,&#8221; and that they were not consulted by the company on this latest project. &#8220;While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products,&#8221; Rubin notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236117" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236117" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236117 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HaptX</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236087" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.</p>
<p>Both HaptX and the recently unveiled Meta prototype use a technology called microfluidic feedback. While your phone or game controller have haptic feedback that uses small motors to simulate buzzing or rumbling, when it comes to simulating deeper sensations across a user&#8217;s entire hand, microfludic feedback behave differently using actuators that control airflow through a network of tubes in a way that can sophisticatedly mimic sensations associated with picking up objects or even feeling unique textures that are all rendered digitally.</p>
<p>Facebook has also showcased a number of AR/VR prototypes over the years showcasing complex technologies that often don&#8217;t end up making their way to the final products but test the cutting edge of a certain technology. HaptX has been building haptic-feedback gloves for enterprise clients for years miniaturizing the tech that has required a backpack-sized pneumatic box that helps manage the sensory feedback of the gloves. It&#8217;s still a very complicated technology that is probably many years of development away from reaching the same mainstream audience that Facebook, now Meta, has been pursuing with the Quest 2.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Meta&#8217;s team has also made some substantial advances to the technology. In their <a href="https://tech.fb.com/inside-reality-labs-meet-the-team-thats-bringing-touch-to-the-digital-world/">research blog post</a>, Meta detailed that they had created &#8220;the world’s first high-speed microfluidic processor,&#8221; a chipset in the glove that controls these feedback controls. One of the company&#8217;s researchers detailed that his &#8220;goal is to invent soft, lightweight haptic gloves that address both sides of the AR/VR interaction problem — helping the computer to accurately understand and reflect the wearer’s hand movements, and reproducing a range of complex, nuanced sensations for the wearer such as pressure, texture, and vibration to create the effect of feeling a virtual object with your hands.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has taken plenty of criticism over the years from startups who say their products were unfairly copied by the major tech giant. They have also garnered some major scrutiny from regulators who say they&#8217;ve engaged in anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full statement from HaptX&#8217;s Rubin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, HaptX has pioneered the field of microfluidic haptic feedback. Our award-winning technology has been widely covered in the popular and technology press, and we’ve worked tirelessly to develop and promote the unique benefits of microfluidics as an approach to high-fidelity haptic feedback. With the longstanding dedication of our engineers, developers, and investors, we have also secured an industry-leading patent portfolio to protect our technology and products.</p>
<p>In interacting with other companies in the VR industry, we have always believed that cooperation is paramount to the development of the industry as a whole. Over the years, we’ve hosted many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta to demonstrate our groundbreaking haptic technology.</p>
<p>Today, Meta announced their own prototype microfluidic haptic feedback glove. The core components of this prototype, including the silicone-based microfluidic tactile feedback laminate and pneumatic control architecture, appear to be substantively identical to HaptX’s patented technology. We welcome interest and competition in the field of microfluidic haptics; however, competition must be fair for the industry to thrive.</p>
<p>While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce and other online businesses are becoming increasingly global in their operations and customer bases, and a startup called <a href="https://www.airwallex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airwallex</a> &#8212; which has built a banking solution that addresses the opportunity to provide cross-border financial services &#8212; has been seeing a massive surge of activity. To capitalize further on that opportunity, today the company is announcing growth funding.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Melbourne-based Airwallex has raised $100 million, capital that it will be using to continue building out its banking and payments businesses into more markets, and to invest expanding its products.</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; which is being led by Lone Pine Capital and joined by 1835i Ventures (the venture arm of <a href="https://www.anz.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANZ</a>, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group) and Sequoia Capital China, all previous investors &#8212; is an extension to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s Series E that it announced only in September</a>; and it brings the total of the round to $300 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The valuation is also being extended with this latest injection: Airwallex is now worth $5.5 billion (compared to $4 billion in September). From what we understand, the company was getting term sheets as high as $7 billion from outside investors (that outside interest was what prompted the round in the first place).</p>
<p>Airwallex today has around 20,000 customers spanning areas like e-commerce, tech/SaaS companies and professional services. It also has 500 large platform customers (Papaya Global and GOAT are two examples) that have embedded Airwallex&#8217;s services within their own services to power transactions for their own customers.</p>
<p>That business has seen a big boost of activity as a result of a few key developments in the world.</p>
<p>For starters, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a big shift toward more e-commerce among both consumers and businesses. In turn, businesses have needed to extend their financial infrastructure to accommodate more customers. And because e-commerce has broken down the barriers of where you can do business, they&#8217;ve also had to extend their financial reach to touch customers in ever-wider geographies. COVID-19 has also massively disrupted supply chains, so businesses have also had to become more enterprising in how they manage these: They may now have to work with more partners and potentially be agile enough to pay different people month-to-month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of these present the kinds of use cases that speak to the kinds of services that Airwallex offers. Jack Zhang, Airwallex&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said that revenues at the company grew 100% in Q3 over Q2. Its annualized revenues in that most recent quarter were $100 million. &#8220;We had a target to achieve that at the end of the year, but we delivered it a quarter earlier,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It also means a number of other companies are also looking to serve this need: competitors to Airwallex across its different services include Stripe, PayPal, Revolut (via Revolut Business) and more.</p>
<p>Airwallex built its company originally around business banking &#8212; its thesis was that companies had a lot of banking options when it came to doing business in their own markets, but for those who worked across borders, it offered domestic and international accounts that worked as easily as domestic ones, along with card issuing, transfers and foreign exchange, payouts and so on. More recently, the company has moved into payments to complement that. The plan will be to add more services natively to that stack, as well as integrate with third-party providers by way of an app store that it is now developing. That will launch potentially next year.</p>
<p>Zhang also said some of the funds will be used for M&amp;A, as part of the inevitable consolidation that we&#8217;re going to continue seeing in fintech.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve now raised $800 million in the last 6 years, with $600 million in the last two years, and we still have $600 million in the bank right now,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;A very large part of that is going to be used for M&amp;A purposes.&#8221; Features that Airwallex wants to have as a native part of its stack it might buy instead of building itself include subscription payments; software to automatically calculate stamp duty depending on the market where items are being sold; and more data analytics to help customers analyze their revenues better. &#8220;I think there will be consolidation in the next period. But it won&#8217;t be just two players. The [fintech] space is big enough for a dozen winners.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it looks like Airwallex is setting itself up to be one of those winners. Zhang confirmed to me that Stripe &#8212; which today is a key competitor of Airwallex&#8217;s &#8212; approached the company to acquire it around 2018/2019, when Airwallex was significantly smaller but already developing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/airwallex-raises-80m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong presence</a> in Asia Pacific, which is still its biggest market, even as Airwallex moves deeper EMEA and North America. (It would have been a big step for Stripe into the region, which has instead taken on its own steam.)</p>
<p>Zhang said that another big fintech, currently valued at around $20 billion, also approached Airwallex more recently. Nothing has come of that, either &#8212; partly because Airwallex is now too expensive, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are probably too big for others to buy us,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>As for what is coming next on the liquidity front, an IPO &#8220;is not on the agenda,&#8221; but is something that the company will think about potentially for 2023 or 2024.</p>
<p>“Airwallex’s achievements in the last quarter alone showcase the strength of the company’s business model and its unique ability to meet their customers’ evolving needs in a competitive digital payments market,” said David Craver, co-chief investment office at Lone Pine Capital. “The future is bright for Airwallex, and we look forward to helping its team unlock greater growth opportunities.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I run operations at an early-stage startup, and I’ve been tasked with hiring and other HR responsibilities. </strong><strong>I’m feeling out of my depth with hiring and trying to figure out visa issues for prospective hires. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Doubling Down in Daly City</strong></p>
<p>Dear Doubling,</p>
<p>I hear a lot from people like you who are in the same situation at early-stage startups. This came up when I chatted recently with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-teter-sphr-1757623/">Erin Teter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-buurma-00693a47/">Lydia Buurma</a> for my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/">podcast</a>. Teter and Buurma are experienced HR professionals who I’ve known for years. They’re currently working in HR at <a href="https://www.linq.com/">LINQ</a>, an edtech company that provides cloud-based administration and finance solutions for states, districts and schools.</p>
<p>“HR is a full-time job,” Buurma said. “When you talk about creating company culture, setting the company’s mission and values, you want to include people in that discussion and you want to get buy-in from core employees and figure out what characteristics future employees that you want to bring in should have.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>The next best option</h2>
<p>If your startup cannot afford to bring on a full-time HR person right now, Teter recommends that your company at least bring in an HR consultant to help evaluate your company’s situation, set up practices and assist with issues.</p>
<p>“Usually consultants are connected with immigration attorneys and other experts who can help you work through the process,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://waldophotos.com/">Waldo</a>, a photo-sharing platform that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">historically</a> targeted businesses, schools, camps, sports leagues and other organizations, is capitalizing on the growing anti-Facebook sentiment to promote its newly launched consumer product. The company today is introducing a service aimed at private photo-sharing among family and friends, which it&#8217;s promoting as an &#8220;ad-free, non-toxic&#8221; and private alternative to mainstream social sites, like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s just Waldo&#8217;s marketing. Consumers, arguably, already <em>have</em> private, ad-free photo-sharing alternatives outside social media. They can create invite-only photo albums on platforms like Google Photos or share privately via Apple&#8217;s iCloud. They can send photos through encrypted mobile messaging apps. Still, Waldo believes there&#8217;s room for a standalone app that&#8217;s available cross-platform and offers a differentiated feature set.</p>
<p>The Waldo app is available on iOS, Android and the web and includes a wireless DSLR uploading feature aimed at photo enthusiasts. Consumers who want to use the service for private sharing can create galleries for their events and then invite people they want to share those photos with. As others join the shared galleries, they can opt in to have Waldo send alerts about any photos they&#8217;re in through push notifications or text alerts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app also offers closed-loop commenting and reactions that allow the photo owner and the commenter to have a private interaction not seen by anyone else in the album.</p>
<p>The new consumer <a href="https://waldophotos.com/pricing/">plans</a> are offered as either a Plus or Premium subscription at $4.99/mo or $9.99/mo, respectively. The former supports up to five family members and the latter up to 10, with unlimited invites and contributors. Plus also includes 100 GB of storage while Premium offers 200 GB.</p>
<p>These are more expensive plans than offered by Big Tech rivals, however. For comparison, a Google One Basic storage <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">plan</a> of 100 GB, which includes photos and files, is $1.99/mo, and 200 GB is $2.99/mo.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"> iCloud+</a> is $0.99/mo for 50 GB in the U.S. or $2.99/mo for 200 GB. So Waldo will really need to sell consumers on its feature set of facial recognition-powered smart notifications, private reactions and custom print options.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VXDwVXt0qg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Waldo plans to build on its existing partnerships with professional industries, like camps, schools and churches that use Waldo as a tool to share photos privately with parents and others.</p>
<p>Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">past five years</a>, Waldo has slowly grown its footprint outside of the consumer space. Today, it has &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers, including a combination of families and employees of the K-12 institutions and businesses its app serves. Its business customers can use the app&#8217;s facial recognition features (with parents&#8217; permission) to automatically identify and tag their students, campers, event-goers and other attendees. That way, parents don&#8217;t have to look through the hundreds of photos the organization may snap in order to find just those that feature their own child or children.</p>
<p>This paid subscription-based service has been adopted by groups across the U.S. and Canada, but Waldo doesn&#8217;t disclose its revenue.</p>
<p>Waldo tells us the plan is not to pivot from its existing B2B offering, but instead expand to a new group of users.</p>
<p>Because parents and others may already have Waldo installed on their phones, the company sees the potential in shifting them over to its consumer photo-sharing service. And the recipients of the shared photos don&#8217;t necessarily have to download the app to join in &#8212; the service can be used without an app installed from the web browser on any device.</p>
<p>As a user of Waldo through my own child&#8217;s camp, this transition makes sense. Instead of downloading Waldo&#8217;s shared photos to my phone only to then turn around and re-share them with grandparents through another platform, I could see how it may be easier to just join Waldo&#8217;s consumer subscription plan and push a &#8220;camp photos&#8221; albums to a few family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to provide our communities with our Waldo Pro solution as it is an important value-add for our families who seek to have all of their family&#8217;s photos, irrespective of who took them, in a single cloud-based, mobile-friendly location, and a huge benefit to our communities who benefit from a safer photo-sharing platform,&#8221; Waldo CEO Rodney Rice told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of Waldo Plus and Premium represents our opening up the platform from only being accessible as a member of one of our &#8216;Waldo-fied&#8217; communities to every consumer being able to use the platform for everyday sharing and all the events in their lives,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A weird thing has happened in the past two years. After years of decline, <a href="https://www.mic.org/#/newsArticle">motorcycle and scooter sales</a> have bounced back. That&#8217;s good news for BMW&#8217;s Motorrad division and its latest electric scooter, the CE 04.</p>
<p>The two-wheel retro-futuristic bike, which was showcased in Los Angeles this week at an event ahead of the LA Auto Show, will be riding a wave of two-wheeled renaissance, which could help usher in larger acceptance of electric scooters.</p>
<p>BMW Motorrad of America&#8217;s vice president Trudy Hardy believes that the two-wheeled EV could come into its own as more than just a cool-looking bike. &#8220;I think what&#8217;s interesting about having a scooter in this category is I think it will start to solve some transportation challenges.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Set to arrive in showrooms in early 2022, the CE 04 will start at $11,795. Like all things BMW, it carries a premium price tag. Yet, for the feature set and the fact that it&#8217;s electric, it might actually be a solid deal.</p>
<p>The scooter will seat two, has 42 horsepower and an impressive 45 pound-feet of torque. The 8.9-kWh capacity battery pack is targeted to offer 80 miles of range and it supports level 2 charging up to 6.9 kW.</p>
<p>Plus it has that large 10.25-inch TFT display that when paired with the BMW Motorrad app offers up turn-by-turn navigation and can track rider data, like how far over you&#8217;ve leaned in corners, as well as the typical motorcycle information.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s an electric scooter in a world where the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/harley-davidson-spins-out-livewire-into-a-standalone-electric-motorcycle-brand/">Harley-Davidson Livewire</a> exists and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zeros-fxe-offers-electric-motorcycle-fun-in-a-slightly-new-package/">Zero Motorcycle</a> continues to thrive.</p>
<p>Hardy believes that for BMW this is a smart strategy, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to bring new people into the brand that might not have considered a motorcycle, but are going to find this to be a friendly solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bike maker&#8217;s first foray into the U.S. market with electricity was the C-Evolution. It was essentially a pilot program. &#8220;It was really to test the waters a little bit. This is our first endeavor really going into the electrification market,&#8221; Hardy told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Although Hardy is nervous that people tend to generalize scooters as something less than what they are. New customers also mean those new to motorcycles and scooters in general. There will likely be customers that currently ride electric bicycles that step up to an electric scooter like the CE 04 and not quite understand that it&#8217;s more powerful than it looks. It&#8217;s easy to dismiss scooters and see something that&#8217;s underpowered, but the reality is the EV torque that makes electric cars so exhilarating is also here on this scooter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a toy. Fortunately, BMW Motorrad&#8217;s entire lineup comes standard with anti-lock brakes and other safety features.</p>
<p>For new and experienced riders, the CE 04 is offering something a bit new. A compact but spirited EV two-wheeler that could be the answer to city commutes. Hardy sees it as part of an ongoing move by the company as a whole. &#8220;BMW has always been known for the performance side and the technology side and it&#8217;s nice that we&#8217;re now entering that electrified space from four wheels to two wheels, which is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also helps that more and more people in the United States are buying new bikes and EVs. That combination might be a win for the funky CE 04.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subaru pulled the cover off its first all-electric crossover for the second time in November. This time, the 2023 Subaru Solterra electric crossover — the Toyota bZ4X doppelgänger — made its U.S. debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
<p>The first all-electric subcompact crossover is a joint project, like the Subaru BR-Z and the Toyota 86 (formerly the Scion FR-S) was before it, and the crossover is a close sibling, almost twin-like, to the Toyota bZ4X crossover that was announced in April.</p>
<p>The upshot: The Solterra is targeting Americans&#8217; insatiable appetite for crossover and it gives Subaru a foothold in the EV market, with Toyota&#8217;s help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The last two years have been very good to Subaru, even with chip shortages crimping the supply chain. The automaker has reported record sales in the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AU4LpYLpzn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/toyota-all-electric-bz4x-250-mile-range/">Toyota&#8217;s all-electric bZ4x is coming to U.S. with up to 250 miles of range</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Toyota&#8217;s all-electric bZ4x is coming to U.S. with up to 250 miles of range&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/toyota-all-electric-bz4x-250-mile-range/embed/#?secret=AU4LpYLpzn" data-secret="AU4LpYLpzn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Known for its all-wheel-drive vehicles, the midsize Forester has been a segment leader in terms of volume, though the company reported that the compact Crosstrek, was the best seller for October of 2021 (by volume). Subaru has said that dealers are having a hard time keeping the more off-road-oriented Wilderness variants of the Outback and Forester on dealer lots, with markups as high as $5,000 above sticker.</p>
<p>Toyota owns 20% of Subaru as of September of 2019, but their partnership goes back to 2005 when GM ended the relationship it had with Subaru. The Toyota-Subaru partnership has been a boon for both companies, as Subaru brings expertise in all-wheel-drive systems to the table while Toyota brings its hybrid and electric powertrains to the smaller automaker. Both Japanese companies tend to be more conservative and considered when pushing into new territory, but the Solterra offers an interesting look into what Subaru thinks the future of electric crossovers with off-road features may look like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A shared platform with all-wheel drive</h2>
<p>The Solterra is another joint project that Subaru has done alongside Toyota, which means that some of the design, especially the interior bits, look a lot like Toyota, while the exterior, chassis and the all-wheel-drive system is all Subaru. Toyota also handled the battery sourcing.</p>
<p>That battery is a 71.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack slung low between the axles and paired to two electric motors, one at the front and one at the rear. Subaru estimates the range to be around 220-plus miles and says that the Solterra can be charged from 0-80% in just about 30 minutes using DC fast chargers.</p>
<p>The powertrain makes 250 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque &#8212; much of which is readily available at the low end, potentially making the Solterra a decent soft-roader.</p>

<p>At an offsite unveiling last week, the electric-ute climbed up and over a small rocky path and through a shallow pond before stopping in front of the gathered press for photos, showing off its light off-road prowess.</p>
<p>While this marks Subaru&#8217;s first foray into the EV market, the Solterra will carry Subaru&#8217;s trademark symmetrical all-wheel-drive system, complete with Subaru&#8217;s X-Mode, which offers better traction in low-friction situations. When one wheel is in the air, the system will modulate the brakes to get you up and over the obstacle, according to Subaru, making this a moderately off-roadable EV. The 8.3-inches of ground clearance doesn&#8217;t hurt either, and Subaru made a point at the LA Auto Show unveiling to note that it is better than the VW ID 4 and Tesla model Y.</p>
<p>At last week&#8217;s event, Subaru also ran footage of Solterra testing on off-road obstacles like stairs, and offset ramps, to show just how capable the small-ute could be. It even pitted it against competitors like the Jaguar I-Pace on the same obstacles.</p>
<p>While pricing has yet to be officially announced, Subaru says that buyers can expect it to start around $39,000. Subaru will start selling the 2023 Solterra in mid-2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instacart's growth rate is plateauing. What's going on?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies had as good a pandemic run as Instacart. The company&#8217;s service saw huge demand gains, leading to waves of venture capital interest.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>From a late 2018 funding cycle that valued the U.S. grocery delivery company at around $7.9 billion, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>, Instacart went on to raise $325 million at a $13.8 billion valuation in July 2020. The pandemic sent many folks home &#8212; and to their phones to order foodstuffs &#8212; to Instacart&#8217;s benefit.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But that was just the start. PitchBook indicates that Instacart raised again in October 2020, adding $200 million more to its accounts at a $17.7 billion valuation. And then in March 2021, Instacart raised a further $265 million at a valuation of around $39 billion. (You can cross-check the PitchBook data <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart/company_financials">with Crunchbase here</a>, if you&#8217;d like.)</p>
<p>Few startups reach the $1 billion valuation threshold. Far fewer make it to the $5 billion mark before going public. And only a true handful get to $10 billion or more. A nearly $40 billion pre-money valuation is stupendous, and puts immense pressure on the company to generate the sort of numbers that public-market investors will expect from a richly valued tech company.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Instacart is seeing its growth rate plateau in 2021, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-pushes-off-public-offering-to-focus-on-grocery-services-growth">per reporting at The Information</a>. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<h2>Instacart&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>The Information&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/berber_jin1">Berber Jin</a> reports that after Instacart tripled its revenues to $1.5 billion in 2020 when compared to 2019, its growth rate has moderated to around a 10% rate this year. Though, she adds, the company&#8217;s Q3 revenue growth was doing better, up around 20% on a year-over-year basis. <em>[<strong>Update:</strong> This paragraph updated to reflect the correct author of The Information&#8217;s piece.]</em></p>
<p>The Exchange reached out to the company about the various data points, but it declined to comment on the record.</p>
<p>After reading Clark&#8217;s piece, I decided to collect information from the company&#8217;s various competitors. Let&#8217;s talk about Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash and Uber, companies that may be snacking on Instacart&#8217;s core business.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For this year's STEM toy gift guide we've split out our recommendations by age for easier navigation. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so check back from now until the end of December for more! </em></p>
<p>For this year&#8217;s STEM toy gift guide we&#8217;ve split out our recommendations by age for easier navigation. The 20+ gift ideas (below) run the gamut from train sets controlled by colorful blocks, to robots that can draw, all the way up to a cute DIY handheld gaming console that&#8217;s really an experimental platform for teens to build on.</p>
<p>Gifts we&#8217;ve selected hit a range of price points &#8212; starting at $15 and topping out at just under $550 (for all the educational LEGO your kid could ever need!), with a spectrum of price points in between.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The learn-to-code category as a whole continues to mature, showing a strengthening (and welcome) focus on art and design, not just pure engineering. At the same time, it&#8217;s clear that sustaining a business selling educational gizmos/games is challenging, with a number of players winking out of existence (or taking an exit) since we last checked in. Product novelty also feels like it&#8217;s diminishing, even as maker hardware itself is flourishing (thanks to the likes of the Raspberry Pi). But, in general, the category&#8217;s experimental &#8220;Cambrian explosion&#8221; moment seems to have passed &#8212; and the programmable robots have (mostly) taken over.</p>
<p>Consolidation remains a big theme in the space. As do pivots (see: <a href="https://musically.com/2021/08/25/kanye-west-launches-a-200-donda-stem-player-with-kano/">Kano&#8217;s new jam</a>, for example). After all, kids are fickle and even the fanciest toy can soon be discarded for a newer, shinier thing. Plus, it feels like some of the earlier hype (and loud claims) &#8212; around gizmos that &#8220;teach coding&#8221; &#8212; has faded to a more practical/realistic and less flashy projection of potential educational value.</p>
<p>One extra challenge for STEM toy makers is the (now) high concern over kids&#8217; screen time. Hence lots of products feature marketing that loudly touts &#8220;screen-free&#8221; alternatives to teaching coding (such as by using physical blocks/cards/buttons etc). Meanwhile some others that do require a screen to work are trying to distinguish what they&#8217;re offering as &#8220;good screen&#8221; time versus the addictive &#8220;digital sugar&#8221; of non-learning-focused games and/or social media … whether parents buy that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For surviving STEM players, increasing amounts of their time and energy are being directed away from the consumer space and toward supplying schools with learning-geared kit and resources directly &#8212; chasing a more reliable revenue stream, although selling to schools is no cake walk, either. Overall, being part of a larger maker marketplace or broader group of educational businesses seems to be where many surviving STEM startups are headed.</p>

<h2>Osmo Explorer Starter Kit</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/byjus-buys-osmo-for-120m/">Indian edtech giant Byju-owned</a> <a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/shopping/kits/explorer-starter-kit/">Osmo</a> has been making educational games for tablets for almost a decade. Its big twist is to combine physical (offline) play (pens, blocks, cards, etc.) with digital on-screen content and interactions.</p>
<p>It does this via a dedicated tablet stand that adds a reflector to the iPad&#8217;s front-facing camera so that it gets a view of the physical play area directly below the screen. This means the app is able to mirror/act on what the kids are doing in the physical space. (And the bounded view means the camera only captures tiny hands, not your kids&#8217; faces, so that&#8217;s a plus for privacy.) Osmo calls this blend of physical-digital play &#8220;embodied learning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <strong>Osmo Explorer Starter Kit </strong>is described as its &#8220;most complete STEAM learning kit yet&#8221; &#8212; with a range of interactive games and art supplies in the bundle (Note: A tablet is not included so you&#8217;ll need your own iPad or equivalent).

<p>As well as pure physical play, Robo Wunderkind has a digital aide in the form of a companion app that expands the learning into on-screen coding. Here it offers tiered complexity &#8212; with three<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> different levels from coding basics, where kids may just be manipulating colorful icons, to doing drag-and-drop block-based coding (based on Scratch) &#8212; which introduces more complex concepts like variables, functions, operators and input/output handling. Python and Arduino APIs are also supported for more advanced programmers. </span></p>
<p>The Robo Sense kit offers a taster of Robo Wunderkind&#8217;s approach, with a handful of sensing blocks to play with plus over 30 projects and tutorials to access online or in-app.</p>

<h2>Artie Max</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.educationalinsights.com/artie-max-the-coding-robot">Artie Max</a></strong> is the latest programmable robot from Educational Insights. Much like its predecessor, <a href="https://www.educationalinsights.com/artie-3000-8482-the-coding-robot">Artie 3000</a>, the STEM toy combines programming and art in a very literal sense: The robot is designed to hold colored marker pens and kids write code that the bot &#8220;draws&#8221; by moving around on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Artie Max&#8217;s main upgrade versus Artie 3000 is that it can hold a bunch of marker pens, not just a single marker &#8212; allowing for multicolored designs to be coded. Programming Artie&#8217;s movements is done via a drag-and-drop interface in the companion app or web interface. Other coding languages are supported, along with a visual interface where kids can draw a design on screen that they want the bot to ink out on paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen is at the center of many industrial processes and potentially part of major future energy ecosystems, but the process of isolating and storing it is wasteful and expensive. <a href="https://www.divigas.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DiviGas</a>, armed with a $3.6 million seed round, hopes to clean up the hydrogen production industry with a new tech that leapfrogs existing methods, potentially supercharging this piece of the new green economy.</p>
<p>While hydrogen itself is generally considered a clean and extremely useful basic element, its production is married to numerous dirty industrial processes. Oil refineries and plastic production, for instance, may give off various hydrocarbons and other mixed gases and chemicals, and to separate them requires further processing and emissions.</p>
<p>One cleaner and simpler option than chemical reactions uses membranes or filters, which essentially separate the H2 and CO2 gases from each other and from other substances in the input stream. But these filters cannot operate at high temperatures, output some gases at low pressures that must be re-pressurized at cost and rapidly degrade in the presence of common acidic gases.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234175" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially the hydrogen diversion industry — and it&#8217;s big, by the way, billions big — is split between an expensive, emissions-heavy option and a cheap, limited option. After meeting in Singapore at one of SOSV&#8217;s HAX incubators, the founders of DiviGas plan to provide a third option that has none of the aforementioned weaknesses.</p>
<p>The company claims to have engineered a new &#8220;hollow fiber polymeric membrane&#8221; at the angstrom scale, which is to say one-tenth of a nanometer. It&#8217;s not like they designed a filter the size of an atom, but rather that the functional features of the material are at this scale, producing the kind of highly specialized effect desired — in this case, causing hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas to separate at slightly different pressures, allowing them to be diverted and isolated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235323" style="width: 979px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235323" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg" alt="Electron microscope image of the fibers and their internal structure." width="969" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg 969w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=768,596 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235323" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DiviGas</p></div></p>
<p>Huge numbers of fibers are bundled together into tubes through which the input gas is forced, with no chemical reactants required. Unlike other membranes, this new one can operate at high temperatures — up to 150 degrees C — and is resistant to common acidic compounds in the gas mix formed from sulfur and chlorine, which means it can handle more caustic and untreated input flows without degrading. And it does so while performing as well or better than the old membranes on basic scales of selectivity (affecting output purity) and permeance (which affects maximum operable pressure).</p>
<p>Because the method is the same in principle as existing membrane techniques, DiviGas&#8217;s tech can be substituted in with minimal fuss and modification. And although manufacturing the new fibers is not a trivial task, they aren&#8217;t particularly exotic and use many existing processes. As co-founder, CTO and creator of the new material Ali Naderi explained, it&#8217;s the result of various cutting-edge innovations but ultimately still easy to manufacture.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make it economically viable, we developed a dual-layer hollow fiber membrane to use the functional materials (i.e. expensive materials) as low as possible on the selective layer (i.e. outer layer) and a cheap/commercially available polymer in the mechanical support layer (i.e. inner layer),&#8221; he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;This type of membrane can be fabricated commercially by using a customized spinning line that has the same price as a standard spinning line has.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prospect of simpler, cleaner hydrogen and CO2 production has been met with extreme enthusiasm by people in the industry, according to co-founder and CEO Andre Lorenceau.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got clients banging down our door, asking us when we can give tens of millions of these things to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This round is us playing catch-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money is going toward building a pilot-scale plant in Melbourne that should be operational in March; currently it takes months to build a single unit (a usable bundle of fibers) for demonstrations, and a given client might want hundreds or thousands on a regular basis. Once the company is able to build them at a rate of around one a week, they can do larger demonstrations and small installations that will secure serious orders — and those proceeds will go toward building out out the full-scale manufacturing process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s two or three times more expensive right now, but they don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Lorenceau said (though the price will come down with volume, he added). &#8220;They say, &#8216;It&#8217;s a tech I know, a manufacturing process I know — if you can give it to us at that price it&#8217;s Gucci.&#8217; And it&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of clients, and we haven&#8217;t even been doing sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>The competitive landscape, he added, is conducive to quick action on their part, being full of slow movers and stalled startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are these giant lumbering corporations, they have a department for this and they do improve, but it&#8217;s old guard. Same reason why it isn&#8217;t the old PhDs of computer science who build the next generation of software tech — they&#8217;re not trying to build next-gen weird shit all the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The startups are also research PhD people who aren&#8217;t used to the high-speed VC thing. They have excellent research performance, but in terms of manufacturing, it costs a zillion bucks to make a square inch of the damn stuff. They say, &#8216;we&#8217;ll figure out the manufacturability&#8230;&#8217; and they never do. So we can leapfrog them and the big corporations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $3.6 million round was led by Mann + Hummel, a German industrial filter company clearly looking to get ahead of the game. Also participating in the round were Entrepreneur First, Albert Wenger (USV), SOSV/HAX, Energy Revolution Ventures, Amasia VC, Volta.vc and Climate Capital, along with several individual investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai announced Wednesday at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show a new all-electric SUV concept vehicle that features everything from lounge seating to what Hyundai calls a &#8220;hygienic&#8221; interior, an appropriate feature as we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Concept vehicles are exactly what they sound like — exercises in creativity and technology that can point to some possible future vehicle. Just because a vehicle shows up as a concept at an auto show does not mean that it will ever show up at your local dealer, however. In this case, Hyundai has created a full-size SUV concept, on a real, you-can-buy-it-at-the-dealer platform.</p>
<h2>The Concept: hygienic interiors</h2>
<p>While plenty of other automakers have shown off concepts with similar lounge-like interiors and seats that swivel 360 degrees for the days when fully autonomous driving becomes an actual reality for the masses, the unique feature of the SEVEN concept is its hygienic interior features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First, a &#8220;Hygiene Air Flow&#8221; system can isolate the airflow between front and rear passengers. Air comes in through intakes in the roof rails and exits the vehicle via the wheel vents in what Hyundai terms &#8220;vertical mode.&#8221; In horizontal mode, or what we normally just consider to be typical vehicle ventilation, air moves from front to back. Hyundai says that the system will work whether the vehicle is moving or parked and that it was inspired by the more advanced systems used on airplanes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235889" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235889" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235889 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg" alt="hyundai interior concept seven electric vehicle la auto show" width="2000" height="1506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=768,578 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=680,512 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=1536,1157 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235889" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Bassett</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to a tailored airflow, Hyundai also showed off its concept for keeping the interior clean between passengers and trips &#8212; since we&#8217;ll all be sharing autonomous vehicles in the future. In the pandemic era, this kind of concern is very real since the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols that can survive for many hours on all kinds of surfaces, including fabric.</p>
<p>The SEVEN concept has a UVC sterilization cycle that runs after passengers exit the vehicle. UVC, or Ultraviolet-C, light is a disinfectant for air, water and non-porous surfaces, and the FDA has reported that it does kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is the virus that causes COVID. UVC light can burn eyes and skin, which is why all the passengers need to be out of the vehicle before the program runs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to custom airflow and UVC sterilization, Hyundai has also included interesting touches like copper, which has antimicrobial features, and hygienically treated fabric to further prevent the spread of future viruses. Hyundai has even included a &#8220;shoe refreshing appliance&#8221; that would clean and deodorize your shoes.</p>
<h2>Real charging and range</h2>
<p>The Hyundai SEVEN Concept will sit on Hyundai&#8217;s Electric Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP. That platform already underpins other vehicles in the Hyundai-Kia group, like the new all-electric crossover Ioniq 5, the first production Hyundai vehicle built on the platform. It&#8217;s the same platform that the Kia EV6 is built on and will be the foundation for future electric vehicles coming from the Hyundai-Kia-owned luxury brand, Genesis.</p>
<p>The platform allows EVs to charge at 400-volt and 800-volt speeds, in the case of real vehicles like the Ioniq 5, allowing it to charge from 10% to 80% in less than 20 minutes on a 350 kW DC Fast charger. Hyundai says that it can get upwards of 300 miles of range from the larger 77.4 kWh battery pack they offer.</p>
<p>While concept vehicles are often mostly vaporware, the Hyundai SEVEN concept offers an interesting blend of imagined and real that gives the world a glimpse of what the company thinks the future may hold for transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram&#8217;s standalone messaging app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threads</a> is shutting down. The app will no longer be supported by the end of December 2021, the company confirmed to TechCrunch after reports of its impending closure began circulating via social media. Instagram is planning to alert its existing Threads users with an in-app notice beginning on November 23, which will direct them to return to Instagram to message their friends going forward.</p>
<p>Threads was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">introduced</a> in 2019 as a companion app to Instagram shortly after the company shut down its other standalone messaging app, Direct. Instead of focusing solely on the inbox experience, Threads was built as a &#8220;camera-first&#8221; mobile messager designed to be used for posting status updates and staying in touch with those you designated as your &#8220;Close Friends&#8221; on Instagram. The app didn&#8217;t gain mainstream adoption, however. But instead of iterating on the experience, Threads received little attention until a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/instagrams-threads-app-now-lets-you-message-everyone-like-its-direct-app-once-did/">revamp</a> last year, which made it possible to message everyone &#8212; not just &#8220;Close Friends&#8221; &#8212; as Direct had once offered.</p>
<p>Though the app had offered a way to update your Status &#8212; or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">even automatically update it</a>, based on your location &#8212; it had been difficult to navigate between the different sections of the app until the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/instagrams-threads-app-now-lets-you-message-everyone-like-its-direct-app-once-did/">2020 redesign</a>. With the update, Instagram attempted to make it easier to switch between friends&#8217; Stories, the Camera interface, and other parts of the experience. It still didn&#8217;t function as a quick way to read through your messages, though, and didn&#8217;t gain significant traction as a result of the changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235737" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app today is ranked No. 214 in the Photo &amp; Video category on the U.S. App Store &#8212; an indication of its continued failure to catch on with a broader audience. It&#8217;s also rated a middling 3.1 stars across 2,500 reviews as users complain about its usability, layout, missing features and glitches. To date, Threads has seen approximately 13.7 million global installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>The closure comes at a time when Meta (formerly, Facebook) is revamping its messaging platforms. Following Threads&#8217; debut, Facebook made Messenger and Instagram interoperable &#8212; meaning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">Instagram users could message</a> friends on Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/messengers-latest-update-brings-new-features-cross-app-communication-with-instagram/">and vice versa</a>. The updates included a host of new features as well, like ways to co-watch videos, react with emoji, change the chat color and more. Eventually, the company wants to include WhatsApp in this cross-platform messaging experience.</p>
<p>Of course, those changes begged the question as to where that leaves a smaller companion app like Threads.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s closure message was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1458213024259522563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, and subsequently written up by smaller blogs. But Instagram had not yet confirmed the details publicly as the message wasn&#8217;t yet displaying to the app&#8217;s users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch its decision to close Threads came about because many of its most-loved features &#8212; like automatic captions and status &#8212; have either rolled out or are now rolling out to Instagram. Instagram also felt it could better focus its messaging efforts by not splitting its attention between two different apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that people care about connecting with their close friends, and we&#8217;ve seen this particularly over the past few years with the growth of messaging on Instagram. We&#8217;re now focusing our efforts on enhancing how you connect with close friends on Instagram, and deprecating the Threads app,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re bringing the fun and unique features we had on Threads to the main Instagram app, and continuing to build ways people can better connect with their close friends on Instagram. We hope this makes it easier for people to have all these features and abilities in the main app,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>The company says it will release new messaging features on the main Instagram app in the months ahead.</p>
<p>On November 23, All Threads users on both iOS and Android will begin seeing the notices that the app will shut down by December, and Instagram&#8217;s Help Center will also display a notice that explains Threads will no longer be supported. When the app&#8217;s support ends, existing users will be logged out and the app will be removed from the App Store and Google Play. When the app closes down at year-end, all Threads features will be available on the main Instagram app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practice ignition</a>, an Australia-based client engagement and commerce platform for professional service businesses, has raised $50 million (65 million AUD) in a Series C round to accelerate its growth and expand globally. It brings the startup&#8217;s total raised to $75 million, said Guy Pearson, CEO and founder of Practice Ignition.</p>
<p>The fresh funding was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jmi-equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMI Equity</a>, marking JMI’s first investment in Australia, with participation from previous backers including Tiger Global and EVP, as well as several strategic investors and family office groups.</p>
<p>Practice Ignition will use the proceeds to double down on growing its core key markets in Asia, North America and EMEA through further development, marketing and sales capabilities. The funding will also be used to fuel its U.S. market expansion through strategic partnerships with Gusto, Intuit and Thompson Reuters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series C raise comes on the heels of a series of announcements. Practice Ignition recently unveiled <a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/news/practice-ignition-and-gusto-partner-to-launch-first-ever-integration-to-accelerate-people-advisory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partnership with Gusto</a> to accelerate the adoption and knowledge of people advisory services. It also announced plans to <a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/news/practice-ignition-expands-r-d-in-toronto-to-focus-on-north-american-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a new R&amp;D</a> team in Toronto, supporting its innovation and customer expansion goals in North America.</p>
<p>Practice Ignition is on an ambitious path to reshape the professional services industry that does business with its customers through its all-in-one client engagement and commerce solution. Its platform integrates digital proposals, payments and automated workflows via leading business apps such as Gusto, Xero, QuickBooks and Zapier to streamline service-based commerce.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gusto is expanding from payroll into a full suite financial wellness platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/embed/#?secret=H9fOh7qhK0" data-secret="H9fOh7qhK0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Practice Ignition has experienced tremendous growth since its inception, almost doubling client revenues facilitated via its platform in 2021. The business is on track to drive significant growth in 2022, with more than 1 million clients across six markets and over $2 billion in client revenue under management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Practice Ignition was founded in 2013 by accounting entrepreneur Guy Pearson and product designer Dane Thomas, who grew frustrated by antiquated manual processes and late payments from clients.</p>
<p>Pearson said its platform was primarily a tool for accountants and bookkeepers, who are still a big part of its customer base. There are a lot of similar workflows in other areas of professional services, such as marketing and consulting, that Practice Ignition believes it can provide value to, he continued. It is continuing to build the platform to suit a broader range of customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating a new category with our client engagement and commerce platform, and we&#8217;re only scratching the surface when it comes to market penetration in the global professional services industry,&#8221; according to Pearson.</p>
<p>As the global professional services industry faces mounting pressure to digitize its operations and customer interactions in light of COVID-19, which has accelerated digital transformation globally, Practice Ignition is gearing up for a substantial shift, Pearson said.</p>
<p>“As the world moves online, many accountants and bookkeepers have to rapidly shift their business practices and functions to be fully digital overnight. With the transition of accounting from tax compliance to advisory, this means that the need to deliver engaging, quality customer interactions via technology is critical for closing deals, boosting profitability and winning and retaining clients,” Pearson said.</p>
<p>“Guy, Dane and the team at Practice Ignition have built a category-defining business with a world-class team. We have been impressed by the strength of the product, the engaged and loyal customer base and the enormous potential for growth and scale globally,” said Sureel Sheth, principal at JMI Equity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Foxconn&#8217;s fingerprints are all over one of the central details in the upcoming all-electric Fisker Ocean SUV.</p>
<p>The company unveiled the production-intent version of the Fisker Ocean SUV on Wednesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
<p>The electric vehicle — Fisker&#8217;s first — will have a distinctive 17.1-inch central screen made by Foxconn that can rotate from portrait mode to landscape, which the automaker has dubbed &#8220;Hollywood mode.&#8221; This Hollywood mode is for the driver and passengers to watch movies or play games when the vehicle is parked and charging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Henrik Fisker, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said they&#8217;ve filed a patent on that swiveling screen technology.</p>
<p>Fisker initially unveiled a prototype of the Ocean SUV at CES 2020, the annual tech trade show in Las Vegas. Now, the company is sharing more specs about the vehicle, including range, various trim levels and corresponding prices as well as details like a solar roof for passive charging.</p>
<p>Fisker plans to offer four trims, in 14 possible colors, starting with the base-level Sport priced at $37,499 — before incentives or taxes. The Sport, which has a peak 275 horsepower, will have an estimated range of 250 miles on a single charge using lithium-ion phosphate battery cell chemistry supplied by CATL.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other trims, both of which are all-wheel, dual motor vehicles, are the Fisker Ocean Ultra that&#8217;s priced at $49,999 and the Extreme trim at $68,999. The first 5,000 vehicles will be the Fisker Ocean One, also at the highest price of $68,999. With those dual motors comes more power and faster acceleration times. The estimated peak horsepower of the Ultra will be 540 hp and a zero to 60 mph acceleration time of 3.9 seconds. The Extreme and Ocean One will have a 550 hp and a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 3.6 seconds.</p>
<p>The Ultra, Extreme and first edition will have CATL battery cells with a nickel manganese cobalt battery chemistry. The Ultra will have an estimated range of 340 miles and the Extreme will push the range beyond 350 miles, according to the company.</p>
<p>Fisker has two vehicle programs in the works. The Fisker Ocean SUV, which took center stage at the company&#8217;s stand at the Los Angeles Auto Show, will be assembled by automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Europe. The start of production is scheduled to begin in November 2022. Deliveries will begin in Europe and the United States in late 2022, with a plan to reach production capacity of more than 5,000 vehicles per month during 2023. Deliveries to customers in China are also expected to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Henrik Fisker said the two companies moved on the design &#8220;fairly quickly,&#8221; and are now diving into the engineering and technical details that include working on a patent for a new way of opening a trunk and other technological innovations.</p>
<p>Curiously, the vehicle manufacturing partnership came out of Fisker&#8217;s conversations with Foxconn to supply a unique infotainment display, Henrik Fisker told TechCrunch in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real issue we have in the car industry is the technology in that car is more than three years old,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And there&#8217;s something wrong with that because we always feel like our phones are better and smarter and faster than what&#8217;s in our cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The aim was to move as fast as the iPhone makers, he said in reference to Foxconn.</p>
<p>Fisker began discussions with Foxconn in January and locked in a deal soon after. The vehicle manufacturing deal, known as Project PEAR, soon followed.</p>
