										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Maryland and Montana have become the first U.S. states to pass laws that make it tougher for law enforcement to access DNA databases.</p>
<p>The new laws, which aim to safeguard the genetic privacy of millions of Americans, focus on consumer DNA databases, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/23andme/">23andMe</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ancestry/">Ancestry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gedmatch/">GEDmatch</a> and FamilyTreeDNA, all of which let people upload their genetic information and use it to connect with distant relatives and trace their family tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> While popular — 23andMe has more than three million users, and GEDmatch more than one million — m</span>any are unaware that some of these platforms share genetic data with third parties, from the pharmaceutical industry and scientists to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>When used by law enforcement through a technique known as forensic genetic genealogy searching (FGGS), officers can upload DNA evidence found at a crime scene to make connections on possible suspects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/golden-state-killer-gedmatch/">the most famous example being the identification of the Golden State Killer in 2018</a>. This saw investigators upload a DNA sample taken at the time of a 1980 murder linked to the serial killer into GEDmatch and subsequently identify distant relatives of the suspect — a critical breakthrough that led to the arrest of Joseph James DeAngelo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While law enforcement agencies have seen success in using consumer DNA databases to aid with criminal investigations, privacy advocates have long warned of the dangers of these platforms. Not only can these DNA profiles help trace distant ancestors, but the vast troves of genetic data they hold can divulge a person’s propensity for various diseases, predict addiction and drug response, and even be used by companies to create images of what they think a person looks like.</p>
<p>Ancestry and 23andMe have kept their genetic databases closed to law enforcement without a warrant, GEDmatch (which was acquired by a crime scene DNA company in December 2019) and FamilyTreeDNA have previously shared their database with investigators.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To ensure the genetic privacy of the accused and their relatives, Maryland will, starting October 1, <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0240">require law enforcement</a> to get a judge&#8217;s sign-off before using genetic genealogy, and will limit its use to serious crimes like murder, kidnapping, and human trafficking. It also says that investigators can only use databases that explicitly tell users that their information could be used to investigate crimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In Montana, where the new rules are somewhat narrower, <a href="https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB602/2021">law enforcement would need a warrant</a> before using a DNA database unless the users waived their rights to privacy.</p>
<div class="css-53u6y8">
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">The laws “demonstrate that people across the political spectrum find law enforcement use of consumer genetic data chilling, concerning and privacy-invasive,” said Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland. “I hope to see more states embrace robust regulation of this law enforcement technique in the future.”</p>
</div>
<p>The introduction of these laws has also been roundly welcomed by privacy advocates, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/maryland-and-montana-pass-nations-first-laws-restricting-law-enforcement-access">including the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the EFF, described the restrictions as a “step in the right direction,” but called for more states — and the federal government — to crack down further on FGGS.</p>
<p>“Our genetic data is too sensitive and important to leave it up to the whims of private companies to protect it and the unbridled discretion of law enforcement to search it,” Lynch said.</p>
<p>“Companies like GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA have allowed and even encouraged law enforcement searches. Because of this, law enforcement officers are increasingly accessing these databases in criminal investigations across the country.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for 23andMe told TechCrunch: &#8220;We fully support legislation that provides consumers with stronger privacy protections. In fact we are working on legislation in a number of states to increase consumer genetic privacy protections. Customer privacy and transparency are core principles that guide 23andMe’s approach to responding to legal requests and maintaining customer trust. We closely scrutinize all law enforcement and regulatory requests and we will only comply with court orders, subpoenas, search warrants or other requests that we determine are legally valid. To date we have not released any customer information to law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA, both of which opt users into law enforcement searches by default, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/science/dna-police-laws.html">the New York Times</a> that they have no plans to change their existing policies around user consent in response to the new regulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The buy now, pay later frenzy isn’t going anywhere as more consumers seek alternatives to credit cards to fund purchases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And those purchases aren’t exclusive to luxuries such as Pelotons (ahem, Affirm) or jewelry someone might be treating themselves to online. A new fintech company is out to help consumers finance big-ticket items that are considered more &#8220;must have&#8221; than &#8220;nice to have.&#8221; And it’s just raised $14 million in Series A funding to help it advance on that goal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neal Desai (former CFO of Octane Lending) and James Schuler (who participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program as a high schooler) founded New York City-based <a href="https://kafene.com">Kafene</a> in July 2019. The pair’s goal is to promote financial inclusion by meeting the needs of what it describes as the “consumers that are left behind by traditional lenders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">More specifically, Kafene is focused on helping consumers with credit scores below 650 purchase retail items such as furniture, appliances and electronics with its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. Consider it an &#8220;Affirm for the subprime,&#8221; says Desai.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Global Founders Capital and Third Prime Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from Valar, Company.co, Hermann Capital, Gaingels, Republic Labs, Uncorrelated Ventures and FJ labs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Historically, if you could access credit, you could go to the bank or use a credit card,” Third Prime’s Wes Barton told TechCrunch. “But if you had some unexpected expense, and had to miss a payment with the bank, there would be repercussions and you could fall into a debt trap.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kafene’s &#8220;flexible ownership&#8221; model is designed to not let that happen to a consumer. If for some reason, someone has to forfeit on a payment, Kafene comes to pick up the item and the customer is no longer under obligation to pay for it moving forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way it works is that Kafene buys the product from a merchant on a consumers’ behalf and rents it back to them over 12 months. If they make all payments, they own the item. If they make them earlier, they get a “significant” discount, and if they can’t, Kafene reclaims the item and takes the loan loss.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2163014" style="width: 231px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163014" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2163014" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?w=180" alt="" width="221" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg 1158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=180,300 180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=768,1283 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=407,680 407w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=919,1536 919w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kafene.jpg?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163014" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kafene</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s a modern take on Rent-A-Center, which charges more money for inferior products, Desai believes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is also a superior product to credit cards, and the size of that market is massive,” Barton said. “We want to take a huge chunk of credit card business in time, and give consumers the flexibility to quit at any point in time, and fly free, if you will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Such flexibility, Kafene claims, helps promote financial inclusion by giving a wider range of consumers options to alternative forms of credit at the point of sale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It also helps people boost their credit scores, according to Desai, because if they buy out of the loan earlier than the 12-month term, their credit score goes up because Kafene reports them as a positive payer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In any situation where they don’t steal the item, their credit score improves,” he said. “Even if they end up returning it because they can’t afford it. In the long run, they can have a better credit score to qualify for a traditional loan product.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kafene rolled out a beta of its financing product in December of 2019 and then had to pause in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company essentially “hibernated” from March to June 2020 and re-launched out of beta last July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By October, Kafene stopped all enrollment with merchants because it had more demand that it could handle &#8212; largely fueled by more people being financially strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, the company was handling about $2 million a month in merchandise volume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With its new capital, Kafene plans to significantly scale its existing lease-to-own financing business nationally, as well as to launch a direct-to-consumer virtual lease card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotaxis may still be a few years out, but there are other industries that can be transformed by autonomous vehicles as they are today. MIT spin-off <a href="https://www.isee.ai/">ISEE</a> has identified one in the common shipping yard, where containers are sorted and stored — today by a dwindling supply of human drivers, but tomorrow perhaps by the company&#8217;s purpose-built robotic yard truck. With new funding and partnerships with major shippers, the company may be about to go big.</p>
<p>Shipping yards are the buffer zone of the logistics industry. When a container is unloaded from a ship full of them, it can&#8217;t exactly just sit there on the wharf where the crane dropped it. Maybe it&#8217;s time sensitive and has to trucked out right away; maybe it needs to go through customs and inspections and must stay in the facility for a week; maybe it&#8217;s refrigerated and needs power and air hookups.</p>
<p>Each of these situations will be handled by a professional driver, hooking the container up to a short-haul truck and driving it the hundred or thousand meters to its proper place, an empty slot with a power hookup, long term storage, ready access for inspection, etc. But like many jobs in logistics, this one is increasingly facing a labor shortage as fewer people sign up for it every year. The work, after all, is fairly repetitive, not particularly easy, and of course heavy equipment can be dangerous.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ISEE&#8217;s co-founders Yibiao Zhao and Debbie Yu said they identified the logistics industry as one that needs more automation, and these container yards especially. &#8220;Working with customers, it&#8217;s surprising how dated their yard operation is — it&#8217;s basically just people yelling,&#8221; said Zhao.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a big opportunity to bring this to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162142" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2162142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg" alt="Two ISEE trucks without containers on the back." width="1024" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg 2619w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=1536,894 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=2048,1192 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ISEE-Yard-Truck-2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2162142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ISEE</p></div></p>
<p>The ISEE trucks are not fully custom vehicles but yard trucks of a familiar type, retrofitted with lidar, cameras, and other sensors to give them 360-degree awareness. Their job is to transport containers (unmodified, it is important to note) to and from locations in the yards, backing the 50-foot trailer into a parking spot with as little as a foot of space on either side.</p>
<p>&#8220;A customer adopts our solution just as if they&#8217;re hiring another driver,&#8221; Zhao said. No safe zone is required, no extra considerations need to be made at the yard. The ISEE trucks navigate the yard intelligently, driving around obstacles, slowing for passing workers, and making room for other trucks, whether autonomous or human. Unlike many industrial machines and vehicles, these bring the current state of autonomous driving to bear in order to stay safe and drive as safely as possible among mixed and unpredictable traffic.</p>
<p>The advantage of an automated system over a human driver is especially pronounced in this environment. One rather unusual limitation of yard truck drivers is that, because the driver&#8217;s seat is on the left side of the cabin, they can only park the trucks on the left as well since that&#8217;s the only side they can see well enough. ISEE trucks have no such limitation, of course, and can park easily in either direction, something that has apparently blown the human drivers&#8217; minds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162138" style="width: 962px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/overhead-render.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162138" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2162138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/overhead-render.gif" alt="Overhead view of autonomous and ordinary trucks moving around a shipping yard." width="952" height="634" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2162138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ISEE</p></div></p>
<p>Efficiency is also improved through the infallible machine mind. &#8220;There are hundreds, even thousands of containers in the yard. Humans spend a lot of time just going around the yard searching for assets, because they can&#8217;t remember what is where,&#8221; explained Zhao. But of course a computer never forgets, and so no gas is wasted circling the yard looking for either a container or a spot to put one.</p>
<p>Once it parks, another ISEE tech can make the necessary connections for electricity or air as well, a step that can be hazardous for human drivers in bad conditions.</p>
<p>The robotic platform also offers consistency. Human drivers aren&#8217;t so good when they&#8217;re trainees, taking a few years to get seasoned, noted Yu. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned a lot about efficiency,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s basically what customers care about the most; the supply chain depends on throughput.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that end she said that moderating speed has been an interesting challenge — it&#8217;s easy for the vehicle to go faster, but it needs the awareness to be able to slow down when necessary, not just when there&#8217;s an obstacle, but when there are things like blind corners that must be navigated with care.</p>
<p>It is in fact a perfect training ground for developing autonomy, and that&#8217;s kind of the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s robots work with very predefined rules in very constrained environments, but in the future autonomous cars will drive in open environments. We see this tech gap, how to enable robots or autonomous vehicles do deal with uncertainty,&#8221; said Zhao.</p>

<p>&#8220;We needed a relatively unconstrained environment with complex human behaviors, and we found it&#8217;s actually a perfect marriage, the flexible autonomy we&#8217;re offering and the yard,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s a private lot, there&#8217;s no regulation, all the vehicles stay in it, there are no kids or random people, no long tail like a public highway or busy street. But it&#8217;s not simple, it&#8217;s complex like most industrial environments — it&#8217;s congested, busy, there are pedestrians and trucks coming in and out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s an MIT spinout with a strong basis in papers and computer vision research, it&#8217;s not a theoretical business. ISEE is already working with two major shippers, Lazer Spot and Maersk, which account for hundreds of yards and some 10,000 trucks, many or most of which could potentially be automated by ISEE.</p>
<p>So far the company has progressed past the pilot stage and is working with Maersk to bring several vehicles into active service at a yard. The Maersk Growth Fund has also invested an undisclosed amount in ISEE, and one detects the possibility of an acquisition looming in the near future. But the plan for now is to simply expand and refine the technology and services and widen the lead between ISEE and any would-be competitors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners are buying a security solution that could be useful as more companies find themselves with some assets on-site and some in the cloud.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Seattle-based network security startup <a href="http://extrahop.com">ExtraHop</a> was riding high, quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/seattles-extrahop-expects-100m-arr-in-2020-ipo/">approaching $100 million in ARR</a> and even making noises about a possible IPO in 2021. But there will be no IPO, at least for now, as the company announced this morning it has been acquired by a pair of private equity firms for $900 million.</p>
<p>The firms, Bain Capital Private Equity and Crosspoint Capital Partners, are buying a security solution that provides controls across a hybrid environment, something that could be useful as more companies find themselves in a position where they have some assets on-site and some in the cloud.</p>
<p>The company is part of the narrower Network Detection and Response (NDR) market. According to Jesse Rothstein, ExtraHop&#8217;s chief technology officer and co-founder, it&#8217;s a technology that is suited to today&#8217;s threat landscape, &#8220;I will say that ExtraHop&#8217;s north star has always really remained the same, and that has been around extracting intelligence from all of the network traffic in the wire data. This is where I think the network detection and response space is particularly well-suited to protecting against advanced threats,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company uses analytics and machine learning to figure out if there are threats and where they are coming from, regardless of how customers are deploying infrastructure. Rothstein said he envisions a world where environments have become more distributed with less defined perimeters and more porous networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the ability to have this high quality detection and response capability utilizing next generation machine learning technology and behavioral analytics is so very important,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Max de Groen, managing partner at Bain, says his company was attracted to the NDR space, and saw ExtraHop as a key player. &#8220;As we looked at the NDR market, ExtraHop, which [&#8230;] has spent 14 years building the product, really stood out as the best individual technology in the space,&#8221; de Groen told us.</p>
<p>Security remains a frothy market with lots of growth potential. We continue to see a mix of startups and established platform players jockeying for position, and private equity firms often try to establish a package of services. Last week, Symphony Technology Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">bought FireEye&#8217;s product group</a> for $1.2 billion, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">a couple of months after snagging</a> McAfee&#8217;s enterprise business for $4 billion as it tries to cobble together a comprehensive enterprise security solution.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been two years since Sony raised the bar for wireless earbuds. Six months before Apple upped its own game with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/apples-airpods-pro-set-a-pricey-new-standard-for-earbuds/">AirPods Pro</a>, the WF-1000XM3 set a new standard for sound and active noise cancelation. Since then, few companies have been able to match – let alone surpass – their performance.</p>
<p>After several weeks’ worth of leaks, the electronics giant is back with the WF-1000XM4 – a pair of buds it claims will best both the sound quality and ANC of the originals. It&#8217;s a high bar with an equally lofty price tag. The pricing was steep with the originals at $230, and now it seems Sony is really leaning in here at $280.</p>
<p>The wireless earbud category was already feeling crowded in 2019, but that’s nothing compared to where we’re at in 2021. There are also plenty of sub-$50 options out (you can also pick up decent Sony earbuds for under $100). Rather than finding a way to drop the cost, however, Sony is looking to cement a place at the truly premium end of spectrum, at $30 more than even the AirPods Pro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>That said, given how high the company set the bar with the M3s, I’m definitely looking forward to testing these things out (a pair just arrived, so more soon). The M4s could well make a great pair of travel headphones – when we start doing that more regularly. The company says the secret sauce here is the V1, a newly designed processor that both enhances the ANC and the sound quality on the buds.</p>

<p>“Specially developed by Sony, the newly designed Integrated Processor V1 takes the noise canceling performance of Sony’s acclaimed QN1e chip and goes even further,” the company writes. “With two noise sensing microphones on the surface of each earbud – one feed-forward and one feed-back – the headphones analyze ambient noise to provide highly accurate noise cancellation.”</p>
<p>There are beam-forming mics on board, as well, to capture sound directly from the speaker’s mouth and reduce unnecessary ambient noise. Interesting tidbit here, too, “The new bone-conduction sensor only picks up vibrations from the user’s voice, enabling even clearer speech when making calls.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163058" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163058" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163058" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9449.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163058" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There’s automatic wind noise reduction for when you’re outside, coupled with a new 6mm driver. The redesigned system promises richer bass and better sound with less distortion. Naturally, Sony has also brought over its High-Resolution Audio Wireless technology, capable of transmitting 3x the data of standard Bluetooth with up to 990 kbps, according to the company.</p>
<p>The buds support Sony’s 360 Reality Audio – clearly something more manufacturers are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/"> looking at for high-end headphones</a>, as they take small steps toward augmented audio. That feature needs to be enabled in the Sony app and naturally only works with select services. Adaptive Sound Control, meanwhile, adjusts playback volume based on ambient noise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163063" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163063" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163063" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2163063" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>As mentioned above, I’ve got a pair sitting on my desk right now, and right off the bat, the charging case is significantly smaller than the M3, while still boasting a full 24 hours of life on a charge. The buds themselves get up to eight hours, which is around the industry standard for higher-end sets. Five minutes of charging the case should get you an hour of playback.</p>
<p>The shape has changed significantly from the M3. The long wings are now bulbous and sit above the ear canal. Curious to see whether this eases some of the pressure with long term use. The buds are rated IPX4 waterproof and work with both Google Assistant and Alexa. They’ll fast pair to Android devices and Windows 10 machines.</p>
<p>They’re available beginning today for $280.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things have captured Silicon Valley-based investors&#8217; attention in recent years quite like the quest to back the successor[s] to Google Docs. The estimable and entrenched productivity suite has been unbundled and repackaged into products that a number of multi-billion dollar tech startups have been built around.</p>
<p>All the while, entrepreneurs are continuing to poke holes in their predecessors&#8217; lore, creating something faster, sleeker or more intuitive. For plenty of the current generation productivity startups, the journey to replace Google Docs and Microsoft Office got a historic shot in the arm this past year as a global pandemic gave remote work software companies a jot of attention.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Covid has made everybody realize that the way that we were working had to change,&#8221; Almanac CEO Adam Nathan told TechCrunch. &#8220;The core tools we used for productivity, Microsoft Word and Google Docs were for when we did a completely different type of work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://almanac.io/">Almanac</a> is trying to revamp the document editor in a package that&#8217;s quicker than products like Notion and far more intuitive than legacy software suites, Nathan says. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last year, the startup raised a $9 million seed round led by Floodgate and has been quietly building out its network of users in early access beta.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2163082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png 2016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The document editor found its way into a diverse number of offices outside tech startups &#8212; from a Domino&#8217;s branch to a veterinary office &#8212; through its open source template library <em>Core</em>, a hub for user-submitted guides on everything from how to run a one-on-one meeting to how to structure salaries for your customer service team. There are 5,000 documents on Core which are accessible to any logged-in user, something that has been a sizable customer channel for the startup as more companies and offices across the country have begun to question some entrenched ways of doing things.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are way more people working in docs outside of Silicon Valley than in it,&#8221; Nathan says.</p>
<p>As a document editor, Almanac&#8217;s core offering is the ability to keep files organized in the way that companies actually organize themselves.</p>
<p>One of its hallmark features is the ability to track document changes in a way that makes Google Docs look completely unintelligible. User can easily make their own copies of documents, merge them with the original and quickly approve changes. Users can also get approval from their manager or another user in their network and ask for feedback along the way.</p>
<p>For tasks that require a bit more thought, people can use Almanac to add tasks to another users to-do list inside the documents themselves, a feature that they might have needed a project management tool like Asana to handle in the past. Updates for items a user has been assigned or has assigned to others live inside their own inbox where notifications flow automatically as documents evolve. The team believes that functionality like this inside Almanac will help teams cut down on unnecessary Slacking and let the documents speak for themselves.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week we shipped a feature that makes writing in Almanac even faster: snippets. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Snippets enable you to save content (or whole docs) and easily reinsert them into a doc. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/YvmHBZM7dG">pic.twitter.com/YvmHBZM7dG</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company is quickly iterating itself into new workflows &#8212; they recently launched a feature specifically around building and updating handbooks, and they also just shipped a feature called Snippets which allows users to save oft-used blocks of texts so they can quickly build up new documents.</p>
<p>In a crowded productivity software space, Almanac&#8217;s sell relies on users fully committing to the offering, that&#8217;s been a central struggle in the post-Microsoft Office era where users have often seen their productivity toolsets swell with tools claiming to cut down on confusion. This often isn&#8217;t the fault of the tools themselves, but with how organizations adopt new software. Almanac hopes that by focusing on common workflows inside documents, its users can resist the urge to open another app and instead realize the gains that come from centralizing feedback in one platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies talk the talk when it comes to diversity, but it&#8217;s harder to know if a firm is actually going the extra mile to hire more qualified people from underrepresented groups, or if they just make noise about it. <a href="https://www.blendoor.com/">Blendoor</a>, a six-year-old startup, wants to put data to work on the problem by giving companies a score based on publicly available data to let the world know just how diverse a company actually is.</p>
<p>Blendoor founder and CEO Stephanie Lampkin says that when she launched the company, it was more focused on finding qualified diverse candidates by mitigating unconscious bias in the hiring process. That involved removing name, age, gender or any other indications that could potentially create bias and just let the person&#8217;s work record stand on its own. She said that the startup targeted companies that had made public DEI pledges as a natural place to start.</p>
<p>As the company directed its efforts in this direction, however, Lampkin says that it quickly became apparent that the public positioning of a company, and how it directed its hiring resources, were often two different things, and she decided to switch focus. &#8220;So we decided to create an index, a credit score, and we pulled in a ton of data from their diversity reports, their EEO One forms if they publish them and all of this buzz around different pledges and investments and partnerships, etc.,&#8221; Lampkin told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She then took this data and structured it, normalized it and built an algorithm that could dynamically score companies much the same way that our credit rating or security scorecards work and make that information public.</p>
<p>She said the George Floyd killing was a turning point for her and the company. &#8220;When George Floyd [was killed] and I saw this resurgence of the diversity pledge, I decided that I don&#8217;t want to play in this diversity theater anymore and just be another check-the-box-solution that companies are using to demonstrate that they care,&#8221; she said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vqfYjE6GS1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/">Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/embed/#?secret=vqfYjE6GS1" data-secret="vqfYjE6GS1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>She added, &#8220;So we decided to double down on BlendScore and in doing so hold companies accountable for all of these big financial commitments that they&#8217;re making in order to track the deployment of that capital, but also the downstream effects in terms of their hiring, retention, promotion rates, compensation equality, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>That culminated in <a href="https://www.blendoor.com/resources">a report the company recent published</a> looking at the data and finding that companies&#8217; public stance doesn&#8217;t always match its public face, especially with pledges following Floyd&#8217;s death. &#8220;My initial purpose was to demonstrate if there is a negative correlation between pledges and performance &#8212; and the only area where we found that to be true was with Black employees versus Black Lives Matter pledges.&#8221; She says that everywhere else there was pretty consistent positive correlation around companies that said they wanted to improve in areas like gender diversity and pay equality, and those that were actually doing that.</p>
<p>In terms of making money, Lampkin says that she wants to focus on helping companies with governance when it comes to diversity pledges, especially for public companies, which will have to answer to a variety of constituencies, from investors to consumers. She also believes that their approach to measuring diversity will also increasingly have an impact on who wants to work at a company and the ability to attract the best talent.</p>
<p>She says that if people are insisting on making diversity a political stance, she&#8217;s going to focus on diversity as a fiduciary responsibility. While it may be good for society as a natural byproduct of that, some companies only see it through that governance lens, and if that&#8217;s the case, she intends to work that angle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What to consider before publishing your diversity memo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/what-to-consider-before-publishing-your-diversity-memo/embed/#?secret=LJx5l3G8dQ" data-secret="LJx5l3G8dQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubling down on ESG and fiduciary responsibility. No more talk about what&#8217;s good for a society. [It doesn&#8217;t matter] what you believe is good for society. This is now about risk management and ESG,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So far the company has 13 employees and she reports she&#8217;s raised about $1.7 million. She acknowledges raising money is a challenge, especially for a Black woman founder. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://afrotech.com/black-women-founders-have-tripled-raising-more-than-1m-since-2018">fewer than 100 Black women</a> have ever raised more than $1 million as of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been really challenging. We&#8217;ve had to just survive off revenue, and think in part it&#8217;s because we sit at the intersection of social activism and for-profit venture, when a lot of investors are like Marc Andreessen they don&#8217;t see a path [for <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/klaus-schwab-on-what-is-stakeholder-capitalism-history-relevance/">Stakeholder Capitalism</a>], but I think that&#8217;s changing and the investor community claims to be on board for more impact investing, so we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has launched a vulnerability disclosure program allowing ethical hackers to report security flaws to federal agencies.</p>
<p>The platform, launched with the help of cybersecurity companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/bugcrowd-crowdsourcing-cybersecurity/">Bugcrowd</a> and Endyna, will allow civilian federal agencies to receive, triage and fix security vulnerabilities from the wider security community.</p>
<p>The move to launch the platform comes less than a year after the federal cybersecurity agency, better known as CISA, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/09/02/cisa-issues-final-vulnerability-disclosure-policy-directive-federal-agencies">directed</a> the civilian federal agencies that it oversees to develop and publish their own vulnerability disclosure policies. These policies are designed to set the rules of engagement for security researchers by outlining what (and how) online systems can be tested, and which can&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for private companies to run VDP programs to allow hackers to report bugs, often in conjunction with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris/">bug bounty</a> to pay hackers for their work. The U.S. Department of Defense has for years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/department-of-defense-expanding-hack-the-pentagon-program/">warmed to hackers</a>, the civilian federal government has been slow to adopt.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/bugcrowd-series-d/">raised $30 million</a> at Series D, said the platform will &#8220;give agencies access to the same commercial technologies, world-class expertise, and global community of helpful ethical hackers currently used to identify security gaps for enterprise businesses.&#8221; Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis told TechCrunch that the directive is &#8220;another watershed moment for the role that hackers play as the Internet&#8217;s Immune System. Bugcrowd team is incredibly proud to partner with CISA/DHS on taking this initiative forward with the US government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform will also help CISA share information about security flaws between other agencies.</p>
<p>The platform launches after a bruising few months for government cybersecurity, including a Russian-led espionage campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">against at least nine U.S. federal government agencies</a> by hacking software house SolarWinds, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">a China-linked cyberattack</a> that backdoored thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">in the federal government</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">announced</a> it would soon add lossless audio streaming and Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos to its Apple Music subscription at no extra charge. That upgrade has now gone live, Apple announced this morning &#8212; though <a href="https://twitter.com/ttam110/status/1401990179557097474">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/iupdate/status/1402154297765335046">noticed</a> the additions actually rolled out yesterday, following the WWDC keynote.</p>
<p>The entire Apple Music catalog of 75+ million songs will support lossless audio.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183">lossless tier</a> begins at CD quality &#8212; 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">previously said</a>. Audiophiles can also opt for the high-resolution lossless that goes up to 24 bit at 192 kHz. Apple has said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">you&#8217;ll need to use</a> an external, USB digital-to-analog converter to take advantage of the latter &#8212; simply plugging in a pair of headphones to an iPhone won&#8217;t work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kk1FmGPCxR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">Apple to add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Apple Music subscribers will be able to enable the new lossless option under Settings &gt; Music &gt; Audio quality. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to choose the different resolutions you want to use for different connections, including Wi-Fi, cellular and download.</p>
<p>When you make your selection in Settings, iOS warns that lossless files will use &#8220;significantly more space&#8221; on your device, as 10 GB of storage would allow you to store approximately 3,000 songs at high quality, 1,000 songs with lossless or 200 songs with high-res lossless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182">Spatial Audio</a> will be enabled by default on hardware that supports Dolby Atmos, like Apple&#8217;s AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip. The latest iPhone, iPad and Mac models also support Dolby Atmos. Spatial Audio on Apple Music will also be &#8220;coming soon&#8221; to Android devices, Apple said.</p>
<p>To kick off the launch, Apple Music is today rolling out new playlists designed to showcase Spatial Audio. These include:</p>

<p>Apple is also adding a <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/introducing-spatial-audio/pl.af1ad34ef38543dd8bcdfc11356bd00e">special guide</a> to Spatial Audio on Apple Music, which will help music listeners hear the difference. This will include tracks from artists like Marvin Gaye and The Weeknd, among others. And Apple will air a roundtable <a href="https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?fcId=1561370672">conversation</a> about Spatial Audio featuring top sound engineers and experts, hosted by Zane Lowe at 9 a.m. PT today on Apple Music.</p>

<p>Because songs have to be remastered for Dolby Atmos specifically, these guides and playlists will help music fans experience the new format without having to hunt around. Apple says it&#8217;s working with artists and labels to add more new releases and the best catalog tracks in Spatial Audio. To help on this front, Apple notes there are various initiatives underway &#8212; including doubling the number of Dolby-enabled studios in major markets, offering educational programs and providing resources to independent artists.</p>
<p>Apple also said it will build music-authoring tools directly into Logic Pro. Later this year, the company plans to release an update to Logic Pro that will allow any musician to create and mix their songs in Spatial Audio for Apple Music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You'd expect an expense management company to have a large sales department and advertise heavily. But like we’ve seen over and over, Expensify just doesn’t do what you think it should.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;d expect an expense management company to have a large sales department and advertise through all kinds of channels to maximize customer acquisition. But like we’ve seen over and over through the course of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">this EC-1</a>, Expensify just doesn’t do what you think it should.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind this company’s propensity to just stick to its guts, it’s not much of a surprise that it got to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">more than $100M in annual recurring revenue</a> and millions of users with a staff of 130, some contractors, and an almost non-existent sales team.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how its possible to grow to such a level without an established sales team, the short answer is: Word of mouth. To an extent, Expensify can do this due to the space it’s in, as expense reporting is such a thankless, almost mind numbingly boring task that anyone who found a good solution is bound to recommend it to their colleagues and friends.</p>
<p>But it’s more interesting how Expensify grows bottom-up within SMBs, its core customer base. By providing an easy and meaningful experience via the product itself, the company has come to a point where it only takes one or two users who love the service to turn their company into customers.</p>
<p>This approach flips the traditional sales model on its head and is now known as product-led growth, but Expensify did it long before it was an accepted business model. Though that was harder than it sounds, it also put the company in a uniquely privileged position, which it is fully intent on leveraging.</p>
<h2>Starting the flywheel</h2>
<p>There are many ways to get such a business model started, but as usual, Expensify threw caution and all advice out the window and banked on turning its users into evangelizers for its product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is ditching a massively unpopular auction format that underpins a choice screen it offers in the European Union, it <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/changes-android-choice-screen-europe/">said today</a>. Eligible search providers will be able to freely participate.</p>
<p>The auction model was Google&#8217;s &#8220;remedy&#8221; of choice &#8212; following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018 EU $5 billion antitrust enforcement against Android</a> &#8212; but rivals have always maintained it&#8217;s anything but fair, as we&#8217;ve reported previously (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/googles-no-choice-screen-on-android-isnt-working-says-ecosia-querying-the-eus-approach-to-antitrust-enforcement/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/duckduckgo-still-critical-of-googles-eu-android-choice-screen-auction-after-wining-a-universal-slot/">here</a>).</p>
<p>The Android choice screen presents users in the region with a selection of search engines to choose as a default at the point of device set up (or factory reset). The offered choices depend on sealed bids made by search engine companies bidding to pay Google to win one of three available slots.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s own search engine is a staple &#8220;choice&#8221; on the screen regardless of EU market.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="05OWd6fuY1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/">Google&#8217;s EU Android choice screen isn&#8217;t working say search rivals, calling for a joint process to devise a fair remedy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s EU Android choice screen isn&#8217;t working say search rivals, calling for a joint process to devise a fair remedy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/embed/#?secret=05OWd6fuY1" data-secret="05OWd6fuY1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The pay-to-play model Google devised is not only loudly hated by smaller search engine players (including those with alternative business models, such as the Ecosia tree-planting search engine), but it has been entirely ineffectual at restoring competitive balance in search market share, so it&#8217;s not surprising Google has been forced to ditch it.</p>
<p>The Commission had signalled a change might be coming, with <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/eus-vestager-actively-working-on-google-android-antitrust-fix">Bloomberg</a> reporting in May remarks by the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vesager, that it was “actively working on making” Google’s Android choice screen for search and browser rivals work. So it evidently heard the repeated cries of &#8220;foul&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s not working, yo!&#8221;. And &#8212; finally &#8212; it acted.</p>
<p>However, framing its own narrative, Google writes that it&#8217;s been in &#8220;constructive discussions&#8221; with EU lawmakers for years about &#8220;how to promote even more choice on Android devices, while ensuring that we can continue to invest in, and provide, the Android platform for free for the long term&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>It also seems to be trying to throw some shade/blame back at the EU &#8212; writing that it only introduced what it calls a &#8220;promotional opportunity&#8221; (lol) &#8220;in consultation with the Commission&#8221;. (Ergo, &#8220;don&#8217;t blame us gov, blame them!&#8221;)</p>
<p>In another detail-light paragraph of its blog, Google says it&#8217;s now making &#8220;some final changes&#8221; &#8212; including making participation free for &#8220;eligible search providers&#8221; &#8212; after what it describes as &#8220;further feedback from the Commission&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen. These changes will come into effect from September this year on Android devices,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The planned changes raise new questions &#8212; such as what criteria it will be using to determine eligibility; and will Google&#8217;s criteria be transparent or, like the problematic auction, sealed from view? And how many search engines will be presented to users? More than the current four, that&#8217;s clear.</p>
<p>Where Google&#8217;s own search engine will appear in the list will also be very interesting to see, as well as the criteria for ranking all the options (market share? random allocation?).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog is mealy mouthed on any/all such detail &#8212; but the Commission gave us a pretty good glimpse when we asked (see their comment below).</p>
<p>It still remains to be seen whether any other devilish dark pattern design details will appear when we see the full implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> More details on how the choice screen will work can be found <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/">here</a> &#8212; including some details on eligibility where Google says vertical search engines won&#8217;t be able to participate; only general search engines can. It will also weed out multiple search brands owned by the same entity, with only one able to appear. Companies that syndicate Google&#8217;s search results and ads also won&#8217;t be eligible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that it&#8217;s not in Google&#8217;s gift to claim these changes are &#8220;final&#8221;. EU regulators are responsible for monitoring antitrust compliance &#8212; so if fresh complaints flow they will be duty bound to listen and react.</p>
<p>In one response to Google&#8217;s auction U-turn, pro-privacy search player DuckDuckGo was already critical &#8212; but more on the scope than the detail.</p>
<p>Founder Gabriel Weinberg pointed out that not only is the switch three years too late but Google should also be applying it across all platforms (desktop and Chrome too), as well as making it seamlessly easy for Android users to switch default, rather than gating the choice screen to set-up and/or factory reset (as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">we&#8217;ve reported before</a>).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is now doing what it should have done 3yr ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU: <a href="https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr">https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr</a></p>
<p>However, it should be on all platforms (e.g., also desktop Chrome), accessible at all times (i.e., not just on factory reset), and in all countries. <a href="https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3">https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1402258047737774082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another long-time critic of the auction model, tiny not-for-profit Ecosia, was jubilant that its fight against the search behemoth has finally paid off.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CEO Christian Kroll said: “This is a real life David versus Goliath story &#8212; and David has won. This is a momentous day, and a real moment of celebration for Ecosia. We’ve campaigned for fairness in the search engine market for several years, and with this, we have something that resembles a level playing field in the market. Search providers now have a chance to compete more fairly in the Android market, based on the appeal of their product, rather than being shut out by monopolistic behaviour.”</p>
<p>The Commission, meanwhile, confirmed to TechCrunch that it acted after a number of <span lang="EN-IE">competitors raised concerns over the auction model &#8212; with a spokeswoman saying it had &#8220;discussed with Google means to improve that choice screen to address those concerns&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;We welcome the changes introduced by Google to the choice screen. Being included on the choice screen will now be free for rival search providers,&#8221; she went on. </span><u></u><u></u><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;In addition, more search providers will be included in the choice screen. Therefore, users will have even more opportunities to choose an alternative.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p>The Commission also offered a little more detail of how the choice screen will look come fall, saying that &#8220;o<u></u><span lang="EN-IE">n almost all devices, five search providers will be immediately visible&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;They will be selected based on their market share in the user’s country and displayed in a randomised order which ensures that Google will not always be the first. Users will be able to scroll down to see up to seven more search providers, bringing the total search providers displayed in the choice screen to 12.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;These are positive developments for the implementation of the remedy following our Android decision,&#8221; the spokeswoman added.</span></p>
<p>So it will certainly be very interesting indeed to see whether this Commission-reconfigured much bigger and more open choice screen helps move the regional need on Google&#8217;s search engine market share.</p>
<p>Interesting times indeed!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the top-rated hotel in New York City? According to Tripadvisor users, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d8501479-Reviews-Mint_House_at_70_Pine-New_York_City_New_York.html">Mint House at 70 Pine</a>, and it&#8217;s easy to see why as you click through the photos. Throughout NYC, hotel rooms are essentially bento boxes, carefully constructed to contain all the necessary bits. But not Mint House rooms. Mint House rooms are virtually complete apartments, and travelers have taken notice.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way Mint House operates, and as the world starts to reopen, the company is well-positioned to serve business and pleasure travelers alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.minthouse.com/">Mint House</a> launched in 2017 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/mint-house-raises-15m-to-give-business-travelers-a-better-hotel/">raised $15M in 2019</a> as it expanded its offering. At the time Tige Savage, Revolution Venture managing partner and Mint House investor, described the company like this: &#8220;Mint House is the best of a hotel without the worst of a hotel and the best of an Airbnb without the worst of an Airbnb.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is different from traditional hotels by offering products more similar to those rented by Airbnb, but while still offering similar features as a hotel. Another company called Lyric tried to walk this line, too, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/lyric-raises-160-million-series-b-led-by-airbnb/">raised $150m</a> before ultimately shutting down.</p>
<p>Initially, Mint House targeted business travelers in secondary markets (read: not New York City). Pre-COVID Mint House rooms were primarily available in Indianapolis, Denver, Nashville, Miami, and Detroit. Mint House CEO Will Lucas explained at the time that there were opportunities in these markets as often accommodations are worse than in major markets.</p>
<p>COVID changed Mint House&#8217;s trajectory, Lucas explained in an interview with TechCrunch. At the beginning of the pandemic, the hospitality industry fell off. Mint House saw occupancy rates fall from 60% to single digits, and Mint House had to refund customers and furlough employees. Eventually, through new sales team members, Mint House discovered their product offering was well suited for the pandemic. Displaced workers needed a place to live and work. Traveling healthcare professionals needed a home away from home. Some university students were shut out of student housing but still required to attend school. Mint House&#8217;s apartment-like rooms presented a compelling alternative to a traditional hotel room where kitchens are often, at most, just an instant coffee pot and a mini-fridge. But with Mint House rooms, guests have in-room kitchens, living space, and recently rising in importance, an actual workspace.</p>
<p>As the pandemic settled in, Mint House saw a drastic change in length of stay. Before COVID-19, the average stay length was four nights. During COVID-19, the average stay length was 21 nights as the needs for travelers shifted. Instead of flying in for a quick meeting, workers and travelers needed a place to hunker down and work remotely. During the height of the pandemic, 81% of Mint House guests were working remotely.</p>
<p>Mint House&#8217;s key features seem purpose-built for social distancing, but they were in place before the pandemic. Guests do not have to check in with a front desk and there are no key cards. Guests can order groceries, and the room will be stocked before arrival &#8212; a service rarely found outside of business-centric hotels but now in demand even with leisure travelers too. Customer service for all of the properties is centralized, too.</p>
<p>While most of the hospitality industry languished throughout 2020, Mint House saw terrific growth. Several months into the pandemic, Mint House saw occupancy rates hit new highs. By June, 84% of Mint House&#8217;s rooms were booked, and the company averaged 80% over the rest of 2020. The company doubled down and grew its portfolio by over 50% in the last half of 2020, too.</p>
<p>Today, nearly a year after the bottom fell out, Mint House is in 24 buildings in 13 markets.</p>
<p>In New York City, Mint House is competing with giants. CEO Lucas explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, in New York City, we have been earning on average 2.2x the RevPAR (revenue per available room),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our CompSet (Competitive set, or rather, competing hotels) is incredibly formidable competition that includes two Thompson hotels, three Marriott Hotels, and Hilton Hotels. We are number one in occupancy, number one in ADR (Average Daily Rate), and putting them together, we&#8217;re more than double the CompSet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucas believes these rankings show Mint House&#8217;s strengths and how the company is different from traditional hospitality brands. And yet, Mint House turned to executives from classic hospitality brands to fuel growth.</p>
<p>Mint House recently announced the addition of several new executives. Jim Mrha, who previously worked at Domio, Hilton, MGM Hospitality, and Marriott, will serve as Mint House&#8217;s CFO. Paul Sacco, a former investment officer and executive at TPG Hotels &amp; Resorts and Starwood, joined Mint House as Chief Development Officer. Jess Berkin, another former hospitality executive of the travel e-commerce startup Porter &amp; Sail, is Mint House&#8217;s new marketing and communication executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re about to really blast off,&#8221; Lucas said with a bit of pride.</p>
<p>Mint House is engaged in an aggressive growth strategy just as the world is set to reopen. The company is looking to double the number of available units and go international, starting with London in a month and eventually in South America.</p>
<p>Now, halfway through 2021, the pandemic is receding, and travel is starting to change again. Mint House is seeing the average stay drop back down from 21 nights in 2020 to something around six nights. According to Lucas, leisure travelers are increasing, and Mint House is seeing the return of short business stays. And then there&#8217;s the new type of business traveler who leaves behind their home office to work remotely from somewhere new, like Miami.</p>
<p>Mint House straddles an interesting line between hotels and short-term rentals like those offered by Airbnb. On one side, they offer the convenience and trust found in a hotel with the style and comfort of a short-term rental. If the company can execute its plan and its recent executive hires should help, the company is well suited to compete with the Hilton and Marriotts in NYC and throughout the States and world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sustainable livestock production and agriculture, measurement is the first &#8212; and sometimes most elusive &#8212; step in the process of turning our food system from a carbon emitter into a carbon sink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So <a href="https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html">DSM</a>, a science-based company that focuses on agriculture and other parts of our food systems, and <a href="https://www.blonkconsultants.nl/">Blonk</a>, a data analytics for sustainability consultancy, developed </span><a href="https://sustell.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a combination software and practical service for ranchers to understand and improve the sustainability of their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sustainable and regenerative agriculture doesn’t have a universally agreed-upon definition, it usually involves changing land management practices to sequester more carbon in the soil, using more environmentally friendly animal feeds and reducing fossil fuel usage of tractors and other farm equipment among many other changes. The goal is to reduce the 7.1 gigatonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere, about </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/#:~:text=Total%20emissions%20from%20global%20livestock,of%20all%20anthropogenic%20GHG%20emissions."><span style="font-weight: 400;">14.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all greenhouse gas emissions, created by the livestock industry.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s this tremendous need for accurate footprinting of animal production down to the individual farm level,” said David Nickell, vice president of sustainability and business solutions at DSM. “And each farm, of course, is very different. And you have to have a system which is able to use actual farm data, and to get an accurate picture of that particular farm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system analyzes the environmental impact of a farm’s activity on 19 different categories, including climate change, resource use, water scarcity, runoff and ozone depletion. Farmers provide data on their daily operations, including feed composition and use, manure management practices, animal mortality, the electricity system and the other infrastructure, transportation logistics and mitigation technologies employed, like scrubbers or excess heat circulation systems, and sometimes packaging to the software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blonk’s environmental footprint technology then produces a life cycle assessment of the farm, an analysis of the environmental impact of rearing an animal from inception to when it exits the farm gate. DSM and Blonk have created Sustell modules for most land farm animals, including chickens, pigs and dairy and egg production, and plans to extend it to cover beef and aquaculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is really key is that we were able to build on this momentum of methodologies and standards that have been developed,” said Hans Blonk, CEO of Blonk Consultants and Blonk Sustainability Tools. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pLbvyUXclB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/yard-stick-provides-measurement-technology-to-combat-climate-change/">Yard Stick provides measurement technology to combat climate change</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yard Stick provides measurement technology to combat climate change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/yard-stick-provides-measurement-technology-to-combat-climate-change/embed/#?secret=pLbvyUXclB" data-secret="pLbvyUXclB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blonk was able to combine agriculture environmental standards from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, European Commission and many others in one place to create the vast library of background data needed for the software to produce useful and actionable insights.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers at the moment really want to understand what they&#8217;re doing,” Nickell said. “They want to understand their baseline [footprint] and rank them. Understand what&#8217;s good, and what’s not so good. Customers want to understand how they rate compared to peer benchmarking, whether it&#8217;s a country or an industry benchmark.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Sustell software gives farmers clarity on the emissions on their farms, they can then identify where improvements need to be made and DSM helps implement ways of reducing those emissions, creating an end-to-end service for customers and hopefully a positive impact on the planet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Practical interventions make change happen,” Nickell said. “We’ve invested in technologies which reduce the footprint of animal products production. The service is measurement and marry that up with bringing solutions, which make a difference. That’s the complete solution to making this much-needed change happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in order for Sustell to create that change, it needs to be adopted widely and the learnings need to be shared between competitors. Right now, DSM and, in some ways, the capitalist system, isn’t set up for that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nickell, DSM is first focusing Sustell on big integrated livestock companies. This is a common challenge with new innovative environmental technologies that can be adopted by big farming conglomerates or co-ops with money and resources to spend, while smaller family farms get left behind. But Nickell hopes that Sustell can scale to work with smaller farms, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second issue is around data sharing. While Nickell was very clear that Sustell will be following all applicable data privacy and ownership rules &#8212; and that’s usually a good thing &#8212; in order to really create meaningful environmental change, transparency is actually key. Competitors need to share the best ways for reducing emissions so everyone can adopt them and save the planet, but many companies are very data protective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think maybe that [data sharing] develops in time,” Nickell said. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re there yet. Maybe it will get to that level as more and more customers are transparent on their footprint and their reporting.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Proving that Central and Eastern Europe remains a powerhouse of hardware engineering matched with software, <a href="https://www.gideonbros.ai/">Gideon Brothers</a> (GB), a Zagreb, Croatia-based robotics and AI startup, has raised a $31 million Series A round led by Koch Disruptive Technologies (KDT), the venture and growth arm of Koch Industries Inc., with participation from DB Schenker, Prologis Ventures, and Rite-Hite.</p>
<p>The round also includes participation from several of Gideon Brothers&#8217; existing backers: Taavet Hinrikus (co-founder of TransferWise), Pentland Ventures, Peaksjah, HCVC (Hardware Club), Ivan Topčić, Nenad Bakić, and Luca Ascani.</p>
<p>The investment will be used to accelerate the development and commercialization of GB’s AI and 3D vision-based ‘autonomous mobile robots’ or ‘AMRs’. These perform simple tasks such as transporting, picking up, and dropping off products in order to free up humans to perform more valuable tasks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also expand its operations in the EU and US by opening offices in Munich, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts, respectively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162980" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162980" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2162980" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg" alt="Gideon Brothers founders" width="498" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg 498w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162980" class="wp-caption-text">Gideon Brothers founders</p></div></p>
<p>Gideon Brothers make robots and the accompanying software platform that specializes in horizontal and vertical handling processes for logistics, warehousing, manufacturing, and retail businesses. For obvious reasons, the need to roboticize supply chains has exploded during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Matija Kopić, CEO of Gideon Brothers, said: “The pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of smart automation, and we are ready to meet the unprecedented market demand. The best way to do it is by marrying our proprietary solutions with the largest, most demanding customers out there. Our strategic partners have real challenges that our robots are already solving, and, with us, they’re seizing the incredible opportunity right now to effect robotic-powered change to some of the world’s most innovative organizations.”</p>
<p>He added: “Partnering with these forward-thinking industry leaders will help us expand our global footprint, but we will always stay true to our Croatian roots. That is our superpower. The Croatian start-up scene is growing exponentially and we want to unlock further opportunities for our country to become a robotics &amp; AI powerhouse.”</p>
<p>Annant Patel, Director at Koch Disruptive Technologies said: “With more than 300 Koch operations and production units globally, KDT recognizes the unique capabilities of and potential for Gideon Brothers&#8217; technology to substantially transform how businesses can approach warehouse and manufacturing processes through cutting edge AI and 3D AMR technology.”</p>
<p>Xavier Garijo, Member of the Board of Management for Contract Logistics, DB Schenker added: “Our partnership with Gideon Brothers secures our access to best in class robotics and intelligent material handling solutions to serve our customers in the most efficient way.”</p>
<p>GB’s competitors include Seegrid, Teradyne (MiR), Vecna Robotics, Fetch Robotics, AutoGuide Mobile Robots, Geek+ and Otto Motors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Compose.ai, which built its own language model to help folks write faster, landed a $2.1 million seed round led by Craft Ventures.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In today&#8217;s GPT-3 world, it&#8217;s not uncommon to hear about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">new software services</a> that deal with text. <a href="https://www.compose.ai/">Compose.ai</a> is one such company, though it built its own language model to help folks write faster. Its early product work was enough for it to land a $2.1 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, it announced this morning.</p>
<p>Compose.ai is essentially an auto-complete function that works wherever you browse the web. The company is also building the capability for its AI-powered backend to learn your voice, imbibe context to help provide better responses, and, in time, absorb a company&#8217;s larger voice to help align its aggregate writing output.</p>
<p>Co-founders Landon Sanford and Michael Shuffett told TechCrunch that Compose.ai believes that in five years, average folks won&#8217;t type every word that they write. They want to bring that future to more people through the Compose.ai Chrome extension, which hopefully workers can access without having to get corporate permission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sanford and Shuffett described their language algorithm as a multi-tier product. Its first tier learns from reading the internet itself, learning English. The second tier deals with specific domains, like email. The third tier learns a user&#8217;s voice, and, in time, a fourth tier will deal with a company&#8217;s generalized approach to language.</p>
<p>The ability for a company to provide its workers with a shared language model that could offer linguistic and word-choice preferences as they write is an interesting concept. The idea of such a strong, centrally held tone lands somewhere between helpful and intellectually rigid. But lots of folks don&#8217;t want to put their own spin on writing; many people don&#8217;t like writing at all. So perhaps having more central support won&#8217;t be onerous to most &#8212; but rather a time-saving hack.</p>
<p>Regardless, Compose.ai is going to staff up modestly with its new raise. The company currently has three full-time workers and some contract help. Sanford and Shuffett told TechCrunch that the company intends to stay small, hiring a few experienced engineering and machine-learning staff to help flesh out its product team.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead for Compose? Its founders told TechCrunch that they are starting to talk to the corporate world a bit more than before and are planning on launching a paid service toward the end of the quarter. That could mean early revenue, extending the startup&#8217;s runway substantially.</p>
<p>What Compose is building isn&#8217;t technically simple, and the company has interesting work ahead of it to get its economics properly tuned. The company&#8217;s founders told TechCrunch that the personalization work that its product will execute for customers can be expensive if done incorrectly; the pair said that they could make a future, $10/month plan attractive economically, but if done in a &#8220;naive&#8221; fashion, Compose.ai could spend $500 in compute costs to support the same account.</p>
<p>That would be bad.</p>
<p>But the company is confident that its impending paid plans should shake out well in financial terms, which makes us all the more interested in giving that version of its product a spin when we get the chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As people live longer and longer and have long-term health issues like cancer and dementia, caring for elderly relatives is becoming a huge societal and political issue. Right now this care is antiquated and run by incumbents, many of which still run off paper and Excel. We are now seeing a new wave of startups turn up to tackle this space by applying Apple’s age-old model of owning the experience end-to-end and running everything on a platform.</p>
<p>The latest to join this race is UK startup <a href="https://www.liftedcare.com/">Lifted</a>, which has now raised $6.2 million in a Series A funding round led by Fuel Ventures. Also participating were existing investor 1818 Venture Capital as well as new investors Novit Ventures, Perivoli Innovations, the J.B. Ugland family office, and a number of Angels. This latest funding round takes the total raised by Lifted to $11.2M.</p>
<p>Lifted says its UK market is increasing and claims the number of people caring for adult loved ones has risen exponentially during the pandemic, with almost 1 in 2 people supporting people outside their household.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is entering a perfect storm of increasing need, unpopular care homes, and the UK Government still without a long-term plan for social care.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162968" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162968" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png" alt="Lifted app" width="576" height="686" class="size-full wp-image-2162968" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=126,150 126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=252,300 252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=571,680 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162968" class="wp-caption-text">Lifted app</p></div></p>
<p>In contrast to a raft of agencies and freelancers, Lifted directly employs its care workforce and uses its platform to “gamify and improve the experience of carers to make them perform better in people&#8217;s lives and also to restore respect to the caring profession” with its  Care Management Platform, says the company.</p>
<p>Lifted has also acquired the ‘Live Better With Dementia’ website and launched the Lifted Dementia Hub, an online community with a marketplace of products.</p>
<p>Rachael Crook co-founded Lifted with Sam Cohen. She says she was inspired to get into the sector when, at the age of 24, she had to care for her mother, who was diagnosed with dementia at age 56.</p>
<p>Rachael Crook, Lifted CEO sold me at an interview: “I was in that position much younger than most people. And it seemed abundantly clear to me that it was an experience that was hugely emotionally important to me, and financially expensive, was really convoluted and frustrating. It made an already really difficult time, more difficult. My mum brought me up to really fight for the underdog and I felt like the carers themselves were getting a really poor deal. And yet, it&#8217;s a huge colossal market. The care market is set to double in the next 20 years, and for the next 10 years, we will look to compete against traditional care companies. We want to transform the care experience. This is a product that is worth four and a half times your mortgage. And yet, it&#8217;s predominantly bought in a really antiquated way with paper and pen systems. It’s really hard to keep up to date with your loved ones’ care. We&#8217;re also competing against new entrants.”</p>
<p>She added: “In 12 months, we have tripled revenue, launched the first App in the world to offer free care advice, and cut Carer churn to half the industry average, all while maintaining exclusively 5-star reviews on Trustpilot.”</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, Managing Partner of Fuel Ventures said: “Rachael, Sam and their team have delivered exceptional growth in the past year. They have a unique vision of the future for care and their model is delivering clear results for both sides of the marketplace.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liteboxer.com/">Liteboxer</a>, the Peloton for boxing, has announced the close of a $20 million Series A funding round led by Nimble Ventures. B. Riley Venture Capital participated, alongside existing investors Raptor Group and Will Ventures.</p>
<p>Liteboxer launched publicly to the world in July of 2020, announcing an in-home device that brings gamification, hit music, and a touch of entertainment to a boxing workout. The patented hardware includes a system of lights that smartly pair with music to give the user an intense workout that feels more like a game. Hit where the light goes off, on beat with the music, until your ass has sufficiently been kicked.</p>
<p>Content is a big piece of the puzzle with Liteboxer. For $29/month, users get access to unlimited training sessions and workouts led by Liteboxer trainers. The Liteboxer also has a Quick Play option, that forgoes the trainer content and lets users workout based on the song they choose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This comes by way of an exclusive partnership with Universal Music. Liteboxer always has a rotation of 100 Universal Music songs available to users, and the system is able to automatically pair the lighting with the beat of the music for lighter-weight workouts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zh2o9Znhnb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/liteboxer-the-peloton-for-boxing-enters-the-ring/">Liteboxer, the Peloton for boxing, enters the ring</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liteboxer, the Peloton for boxing, enters the ring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/liteboxer-the-peloton-for-boxing-enters-the-ring/embed/#?secret=Zh2o9Znhnb" data-secret="Zh2o9Znhnb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not only are users competing with themselves, but they can also connect with other friends to compete against one another.</p>
<p>Engagement is the name of the game for Liteboxer, according to cofounders Jeff Morin (CEO) and Todd Dagres (Chairman). They say that since shipping equipment in October, they&#8217;re seeing users, on average, doing a Liteboxer workout four to five times a week.</p>
<p>Since launch, the company has made some tweaks. For one, the original focus on the trainer side was on the technique of boxing. But given the importance of music to the workouts, Liteboxer has realized the impact that an entertaining trainer can have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rhythm has been so important,&#8221; said Morin. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned that you can&#8217;t train rhythm if someone doesn&#8217;t have that. We&#8217;ve seen trainers with more spin class experience be able to feel the cadence of the music, and know when the beat drop is coming, and craft these programs that are basically an art piece or performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also looking at its employment of these trainers, shifting from 1099 to part-time employment and seriously considering full-time W2 employment for them, as well.</p>
<div></div>
<div>This latest round of funding is meant to fuel growth and power initiatives aimed at getting the device out in the wild so more people can see and experience it. The cofounders explained that this was one of the big challenges of launching during the pandemic with a product like this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $28.5 million.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early stage investor Version One, which consists of partners Boris Wertz and Angela Tran, has <a href="https://versionone.vc/announcing-fund-iv-and-opportunities-fund-ii/">raised its fourth fund</a>, as well as a second opportunity fund specifically dedicated to making follow-on investments. Fund IV pools $70 million from LPs to invest, and Opportunities Fund II is $30 million, both up from the $45 million Fund III and roughly $20 million original Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>Version One is unveiling this new pool of capital after a very successful year for the firm, which is based in Vancouver and San Francisco. 2021 saw its first true blockbuster exit, with Coinbase&#8217;s IPO. The investor also saw big valuation boosts on paper for a number of its portfolio companies, including Ada (which raises at a $1.2 billion valuation in May); Dapper Labs (valued at $7.5 billion after riding the NFT wave); and Jobber (no valuation disclosed but raised a $60 million round in January).</p>
<p>I spoke to both Wertz and Tran about their run of good fortune, how they think the fund has achieved the wins it recorded thus far, and what Version One has planned for this Fund IV and its investment strategy going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this pretty broad focus of mission-driven founders, and not necessarily just investing in SaaS, or just investing in marketplaces, or crypto,&#8221; Wertz said regarding their focus. &#8220;We obviously love staying early — pre-seed and seed — we&#8217;re really the investors that love investing in people, not necessarily in existing traction and numbers. We love being contrarian, both in terms of the verticals we go in to, and and the entrepreneurs we back; we&#8217;re happy to be backing first-time entrepreneurs that nobody else has ever backed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In speaking to different startups that Version One has backed over the years, I&#8217;ve always been struck by how connected the founders seem to the firm and both Wertz and Tran — even much later in the startups&#8217; maturation. Tran said that one of their advantages is following the journey of their entrepreneurs, across both good times and bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get to learn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so cool to watch these companies scale [&#8230;] we get to see how these companies grow, because we stick with them. Even the smallest things we&#8217;re just constantly thinking about— we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Laura [Behrens Wu] at Shippo, we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Mike [Murchison] and David [Hariri] at Ada, even though it&#8217;s getting harder to really help them move the needle on their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wertz also discussed the knack Version One seems to have for getting into a hot investment area early, anticipating hype cycles when many other firms are still reticent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We we went into crypto early in 2016, when most people didn&#8217;t really believe in crypto,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We started investing pretty aggressively in in climate last year, when nobody was really invested in climate tech. Having a conviction in in a few areas, as well as the type of entrepreneurs that nobody else really has conviction is what really makes these returns possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since climate tech is a relatively new focus for Version One, I asked Wertz about why they&#8217;re betting on it now, and why this is not just another green bubble like the one we saw around the end of the first decade of the 2000s.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, we deeply care about it,&#8221; he said. Secondly, we think there is obviously a new urgency needed for technology to jump into to what is probably one of the biggest problems of humankind. Thirdly, is that the clean tech boom has put a lot of infrastructure into the ground. It really drove down the cost of the infrastructure, and the hardware, of electric cars, of batteries in general, of solar and renewable energies in general. And so now it feels like there&#8217;s more opportunity to actually build a more sophisticated application layer on top of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tran added that Version One also made its existing climate bet at what she sees as a crucial inflection point — effectively at the height of the pandemic, when most were focused on healthcare crises instead of other imminent existential threats.</p>
<p>I also asked her about the new Opportunity Fund, and how that fits in with the early stage focus and their overall functional approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t require much change in the way we operate, because we&#8217;re not doing any net new investments,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;So we recognize we&#8217;re not growth investors, or Series A/Series B investors that need to have a different lens in the way that they evaluate companies. For us, we just say we want to double down on these companies. We have such close relationships with them, we know what the opportunities are. It&#8217;s almost like we have information arbitrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>That works well for all involved, including LPs, because Tran said that it&#8217;s appealing to them to be able to invest more in companies doing well without having to build a new direct relationship with target companies, or doing something like creating an SPV designated for the purpose, which is costly and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what&#8217;s going to change with this fund and their investment approach, Wertz points to a broadened international focus made possible by the increasingly distributed nature of the tech industry following the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the thing that probably will change the most is just much more international investing in this one, and I think it&#8217;s just direct result of the pandemic and Zoom investing, that suddenly the pipeline has opened up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot about ourselves over the past year and a half,&#8221; Tran added. &#8220;I mean, we&#8217;ve always been distributed, [&#8230;] and being remote was one of our advantages. So we certainly benefited and we didn&#8217;t have to adjust our working style too much, right. But now everyone&#8217;s working like this, [&#8230;] so it&#8217;s going to be fun to see what advantage we come up with next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selling enterprise software is much more complicated than convincing a potential customer that your solution is the best and signing a contract. A <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey">recent Gartner study </a>found that buying groups for B2B solutions can involve up to six to 10 decision makers, and that the majority of buyers said their most recent purchase was “very complex or difficult” as they came to a consensus while negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://buyerassist.io/">BuyerAssist</a>, a new startup founded by former employees of sales readiness platform MindTickle, wants to make the buying process as smooth as possible. The company is launching its beta product to the public today with $2 million in seed funding led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Emergent Ventures, with participation from angel investors. The capital will be used for hiring in the U.S. and India, with plans to bring BuyerAssist’s platform out of beta later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Headquartered in San Francisco, with an office in Pune, India, BuyerAssist.io was founded last year by Amit Dugar, Shankar Ganapathy and Shyam HN, all alumni of SoftBank Vision 2-backed MindTickle, a platform that enables companies to train their sales staff at scale. The philosophy behind BuyerAssist draws on HN and Ganapathy’s experience on the sales and marketing side of MindTickle: Ganapathy was its director of strategic accounts, while HN served as head of global sales development.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold half a million dollar deals, and deals where you have anywhere form 10 to 25 people involved from the buyer side,” HN told TechCrunch. “There’s a core team of about five to 10 people, but then there is also an extended team that comes and goes during the process.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sales readiness platform MindTickle raises $100 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/sales-readiness-platform-mindtickle-raises-100-million-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/embed/#?secret=nt4K7isZs6" data-secret="nt4K7isZs6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The pandemic added an extra layer of complexity to B2B sales, because many deals were done remotely. Furthermore, sales representatives get less time to interact with buyers. The Gartner report found that when B2B buying teams consider a purchase, they spend only 17% of that time meeting with potential suppliers, and the amount of time they spend interacting with any sales representative may be only 5% to 6%. This means vendors have to find ways to keep potential buyers engaged, while making the process easier for them.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist describes itself as a &#8220;operating system for B2B companies to deliver the most effective buying experience.&#8221; It helps by providing a centralized place to gather information that would usually be buried in emails and notes, and make it searchable. It also lets both vendors and buyers share information about their needs (like pricing, information security reviews and when they want to deploy software by), creating more transparency for each side, and stores important files like proposals, contracts and legal documentation.</p>
<p>For vendors, having information and questions from potential buyers organized in one place can help them better understand their deals pipeline and meet revenue goals. BuyerAssist also provides analytics that can help them retain more contracts. For example, it alerts vendors when buyers become less engaged, which may mean they are losing interest.</p>
<p>During its beta stage, BuyerAssist worked with four companies. The platform is currently focused on enterprise software and SaaS companies that do a lot of their sales remotely, but can be used for any complex sales process that involves multiple calls and emails. Other sectors BuyerAssist wants to enter include manufacturing and financial services.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist is part of a new crop of startups focused on helping vendors and buyers work together on complicated sales. Others include Accord, MetaCX, Dealpoint and Recapped.io. HN said that the space is still very new, so companies are still figuring out their positioning. In BuyerAssist’s case, this means focusing on buyer engagement, instead of mutual success plans or collaborations, from the beginning. HN said the company will double down on investing in two key areas of product development: building its enterprise grade product to support complex sales and becoming the preferred way for buying teams to engage with BuyerAssist’s clients.</p>
<p>In statement about the investment, Stellaris Venture Partners partner Alok Goyal said, “As a venture capitalist focusing on the SaaS space, we get to see hundreds of teams. But it is very rare to find teams that create a perfect storm of domain expertise, functional expertise in different areas of building SaaS companies and at the same time bringing the perfect complementarity between the founders.”</p>
<p>Anupam Rastogi, a partner at Emergent Ventures, said “What excites me about BuyerAssist is that it focuses on reducing friction between buyers and sellers. Buyers want more flexibility and less noise. Sellers want to run a more consistent sales process. BuyerAssist facilitates this, and enables both to build a long term partnership. This is where we see the industry heading in the years and decades to come.&#8221;</p>
