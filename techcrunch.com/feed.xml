										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As wave after wave of regulatory crackdowns have dominated China tech news in 2021, one can be excused for losing track of what is being regulated, who is doing the regulating, and what exactly the regulations are. From <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/02/strategist-on-chinas-regulation-of-its-tech-giants-fintech.html">fintech</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-coming-data-laws-leave-firms-with-more-questions-than-answers-2021-08-27/">data management</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-casualties-of-chinas-education-crackdown/">education</a>, the rules of the game are being re-written by a range of agencies, often at a rate faster than all but the keenest observers can follow.</p>
<p>For antitrust, a newly-empowered bureaucratic entity appears to be sending the signal that we are only at the beginning of a large-scale reorganization of how Chinese internet firms interact with consumers, vendors, and the state. Formed only three years ago as a merger of already-existing agencies, the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) has quickly become a force to be reckoned with, reshaping how companies view risk and opportunity in the market with the world’s most internet users.</p>
<p>Having already levied hefty <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/china-tech-stocks-rise-after-meituan-hit-with-antitrust-fine.html%23:~:text=The%252520fine%252520equated%252520to%2525203,of%252520an%252520anti%25252Dmonopoly%252520investigation.">fines</a> on the likes of Alibaba and Meituan, recent developments suggest that SAMR is only getting started. On October 13, <i>Reuters</i> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-readies-plan-elevate-status-antitrust-unit-sources-2021-10-13/">reported</a> that China is considering upgrading the antitrust bureau within SAMR to deputy-ministerial status, under the name of the National Antimonopoly Bureau.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222826" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The elevated ranking would reportedly help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions and would also help to strengthen SAMR&#8217;s in-house capability to conduct research that it has previously had to outsource. This would be aligned with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-chinas-antitrust-regulator-bulking-up-crackdown-behemoths-widens-2021-04-11/">previous reporting</a> that the agency had been planning to considerably expand its workforce.</p>
<p>That portends further choppy waters for China’s tech giants and others competing for market share. It’s also rapidly changing the investor calculus of how to value some of the fastest-growing companies in the world.</p>
<h2>Trusts and the antitrust blowback</h2>
<p>This sort of regulatory blowback is hardly unprecedented. Known for its opulence and extreme inequality, the “Gilded Age” of the decades that followed the American Civil War saw the rise of the U.S. as an industrial and economic superpower. The period was marked by a weak central government and the rise of the country’s hyper-wealthy corporate interests and industrialists with names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan, whose monopolies dominated economics, politics, and society.</p>
<p>While a time of great innovation and dynamism, its excesses also brought about the corrective measures of Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Era at the turn of the century, in which regulatory measures were taken to conserve natural resources, protect consumers and break up corporate monopolies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As several <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2021-02-16/chinas-gilded-age-paradox-economic-boom-and-vast-corruption">observers</a> have noted, present-day China has more than a few parallels with America as it transitioned from the Gilded to the Progressive Era: with a country stricken by social inequality, environmental degradation and behemoth corporate interests, Xi Jinping has consolidated control over the reins of the state and is attempting to curb the excesses that have resulted from decades of transformative growth.</p>
<p>Like Roosevelt, Xi appears to view his country’s most valuable corporations as oversized giants whose dominance threatens the long-term health of its economy and society. Yet while Roosevelt busted oil and railroad monopolies, Xi seems to have his sights set squarely on China’s world-leading internet companies.</p>
<h2>Redefining “monopoly” for the platform economy</h2>
<p>As China’s leaders seek to turn the page on the country’s Gilded Age through digital-era trust-busting, it is also looking to re-examine how monopolies are defined. For China and the rest of the world alike, this means crafting regulations that address the unique characteristics of market power in the digital economy. “As many of the large internet platforms are two-sided marketplaces, regulation needs to consider both consumer and merchant protections,” explains Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based analyst for market research firm AgencyChina. “Effective regulation needs to walk a tightrope between consumer protections, merchant interests, and platform economics.”</p>
<p>This stands in contrast to the longstanding established norm in the U.S. of the <a href="https://laweconcenter.org/resource/tldr-consumer-welfare-standard/">Consumer Welfare Standard</a>, which directs courts and regulators to focus on the effects that challenged business practices have on consumers, rather than on alleged harms to specific competitors. For a digital economy in which the largest players such as Alibaba or Amazon function largely as intermediaries between vendors and consumers, and which use their massive scale to outmatch their competition, increasing numbers of policymakers have argued that the Consumer Welfare Standard is insufficiently comprehensive.</p>
<p>SAMR appears to be taking that position as well, given the targets of its investigations and the penalties it has levied thus far. <a href="https://qz.com/1994879/what-is-erxuanyi-which-led-to-alibabas-2-8-billion-fine/">Alibaba</a> and <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202110/t20211008_335364.html">Meituan</a> have each been slapped with fines of 3-4 percent of annual revenue for their longstanding “choose one from two (er xuan yi 二选一)” practices, in which merchants were pressured to use the platform exclusively. While this practice was at times explicit, it often was exercised through more subtle or deceptive means, exploiting the data and recommendation algorithms that play such a prominent role in determining a merchant’s success. Some such tactics were listed in the recent SAMR announcement as it concluded its Meituan investigation.</p>
<p>Along such lines of forced exclusivity, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also directed internet firms to tear down their “<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008506/chinese-tech-companies-vow-to-tear-down-their-walled-garden-">walled gardens</a>,” and cease their formerly common practice of blocking competitors’ links on their platforms. Though adding complications for some firms, the banning of such behavior seems to be welcomed among Chinese consumers, as the inability to share Alibaba’s links on Tencent’s WeChat platform was a common annoyance.</p>
<p>SAMR has also ordered Tencent Music Entertainment to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-regulator-bars-tencent-exclusive-rights-online-music-2021-07-24/">cease</a> its exclusive deals with record labels, levying a minor fine of 500,000RMB (roughly $77,000), but also calling into question the business models of other content platforms whose business models rely heavily on exclusive deals with sought-after content producers.</p>
<h2>A challenging time for investors</h2>
<p>For investment firms, a greater concern may be in the heightened scrutiny over mergers and acquisitions. In July, a $5.3 billion merger between China’s leading game-streaming platforms Huya and Douyu was <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3141283/beijings-decision-block-tencents-douyu-huya-merger-deal-marks-end">terminated</a> two days after a SAMR decision to prohibit it, the first “adverse” merger control decision adopted by SAMR and its predecessor against a transaction without foreign participation.</p>
<p>Indeed, China’s antitrust push, coupled with its broader wave of regulations, have investors rethinking their strategy in the country. One anonymous employee of a prominent VC firm complained of greatly increased complications in gaining approval for a recent merger proposal, citing a far more invasive screening from SAMR than was previously expected, with questions ranging from business models and practices to issues of national security. In the end, the firm decided not to move forward with the deal.</p>
<p>Questions also loom large for the superstar firms that once headlined equity investors’ China portfolios. For many large, platform-based firms, consistent profitability has remained elusive. The prospect of continued growth and the profits that can be extracted from future market dominance was central to their once-soaring share prices and valuations. The e-commerce and food delivery fields in which Alibaba and Meituan operate, for example, are famously high volume/low margin areas. The fines, which amounted to 3-4% of top-line sales volume, do serious damage to already thin bottom lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps most worrisome to investors are the limited windows when they can achieve exits for their China-based investments. In addition to increased deal scrutiny that make mergers and acquisitions more difficult, regulatory roadblocks to IPOs are popping up where they have not been seen before. Though the dramatic eleventh-hour halting of Ant Group’s late-2020 listing sent shockwaves through the financial community, it was also seen as an anomaly: had it gone through, it would have been the biggest public offering in history. The intervention to block it was also conducted by China’s powerful central bank, and reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556">ordered</a> by Xi Jinping himself.</p>
<p>What we are now seeing is a growing number of regulatory agencies further down the bureaucratic hierarchy who have both the power and the mandate to interfere with IPOs if they deem it necessary.</p>
<p>There is, of course, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China’s counterpart to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has announced a new cross-agency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-market-regulations/china-forms-cross-agency-team-to-crack-down-on-securities-misbehaviour-idUSKBN2GC12C">task force</a> to crack down on illegal activities in the country’s capital markets as a number of the regulator’s former leaders are charged with <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-10-06/another-former-china-securities-official-under-investigation-101783541.html">corruption</a>.</p>
<p>After ride-hailing platform Didi Chuxing <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-suggested-didi-delay-its-u-s-ipo-11625510600">ignored</a> warnings not to go through with their U.S. offering until after conducting a thorough examination of its network security, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the country’s chief cybersecurity watchdog) appears to be dedicated to making an example out of the company, removing it from app stores and placing the future of both the firm and its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-didi-co-founder-liu-told-associates-she-plans-leave-sources-2021-09-20/">leaders</a> in question.</p>
<p>Finally, as SAMR is given elevated status, it is highly likely that it will also have the power to determine if and how a company is allowed to go public.</p>
<p>For investors hoping for IPOs, the road to their exit is lined with a growing number of checkpoints whose standards seem to be getting progressively tighter.</p>
<h2>How far will China’s antitrust mandate go?</h2>
<p>With an elevated regulator coupled to a sweeping mandate, China’s antitrust campaign can now potentially reach areas where very little precedent has been set. Compounded with the authoritarian nature of China’s political system, there is very little that firms can do to fight back. In many cases, the best they can try for is to comply, and maintain a positive working relationship with authorities, as the alternative is far worse.</p>
<p>“Chinese authorities are very adept at using reputational sanctions,” explained University of Hong Kong law professor Angela Huyue Zhang while appearing on <a href="https://technode.com/2021/03/19/china-tech-investor-chinese-antritrust-exceptionalism-with-angela-huyue-zhang/">my podcast</a> to discuss her book <i>Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism</i>. “They are very adept at leaking information to (state media) and there are different ways that they can announce an investigation, leading to different levels of media publicity.” Zhang went on to cite Alibaba’s $90 billion drop in market capitalization after the mere announcement of an antitrust investigation on Christmas Eve of 2020. As Didi is also now experiencing, the reputational taint of being outside of Beijing’s good graces can be as damaging as any formal punishment.</p>
<p>With investigations into Alibaba and Meituan now concluded, it may be the case that the scrutiny into “choose one from two” practices are wrapping up. However, fear and speculation outweighs the certainty at the moment, as a newly-empowered and staffed-up SAMR likely has plenty on its to-do list.</p>
<p>One popular theory is that the beefed-up SAMR will spend more of its muscle targeting subsidized group-buying practices that helped propel the rise of social e-commerce firms like Pinduoduo, but which also can place strong downward pressure on prices, hurting small vendors. In March, SAMR <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202103/t20210303_326448.html">slapped</a> minor fines on five firms for illegal behavior around group-buying practices. As such practices have been known to be quite common among China’s internet platforms, there could be considerably more to be found if regulators continue to dig, as well as harsher penalties, perhaps, to follow.</p>
<p>“Previous SAMR-issued fines and commentary show they take a harsh view of subsidies used to sell goods and services below cost,” says Norris. “A stronger penalty regime is what SAMR needs if it&#8217;s to create an effective deterrent to subsidy-driven growth.”</p>
<p>What is also worth noting is the extraterritorial nature with which antitrust can be used, particularly as a countermeasure to U.S. sanctions. “In 2018, there was an onslaught of sanctions on Huawei and ZTE and other Chinese tech companies, and this was really a wakeup call for the Chinese government, which realized that the U.S. has such strong extraterritorial sanctioning power,” said Zhang. “One of the tools that [the Chinese government] came up with was antitrust, as it allows them to exert extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign business.”</p>
<p>This came into play significantly in mid-2018, when Qualcomm <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nxp-semicondtrs-m-a-qualcomm/qualcomm-ends-44-billion-nxp-bid-after-failing-to-win-china-approval-idUSKBN1KF193">abandoned</a> a proposed $44 billion acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors after struggling to get SAMR approval for the deal. Though U.S.-China relations appear to be somewhat brought back from the brink of the Trump years, it is clear that China considers extraterritorial antitrust measures to be an arrow in its quiver.</p>
<p>What we do know is that for both foreign and domestic firms alike, the free-wheeling days of China’s Gilded Age are quickly becoming a thing of the past, and that antitrust is a powerful tool in forcing that transition to happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technology has never agreed with boundaries. Even the most detailed satellite snapshots of Earth show no borders. From the printing press to the airplane, the telephone to social media, technological progress has helped us transcend time and place. And when it hasn’t sent memes around the world, it has ignited revolutions.</p>
<p>We’ve grown used to technology’s subversive ability, but that is not the way it has always been. Far from overcoming borders, technology has more often than not been used to change them. From ancient Rome and China to the British Empire to the United States, the story of world history can be told as one in which those who harness technology prevail.</p>
<p>Until about thirty years ago.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, technological progress has been largely set apart from politics. Consumer demand, not affairs of state, drove society forward.</p>
<p>This benign neglect brought us tremendous benefits: smartphones, electric cars – the World Wide Web! Can we imagine making it through the last 18 months without Zoom, TikTok, or Amazon Prime? But the tone has shifted as of late. For the first time in living memory, politics is perhaps the most important factor in the future of tech.</p>
<p>That’s why today we’re launching the <strong>TechCrunch Global Affairs Project</strong>.</p>
<p>After several decades of near impunity, the world’s tech titans are facing a rapidly changing political environment. European regulators hound tech multinationals on tax, privacy and monopoly abuses. Chinese authorities are clipping the wings of the country&#8217;s most powerful companies while restricting their foreign competitors. And in a politically divided America, an energized antitrust drive is one of the few policy areas that has momentum – and bipartisan consensus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This scrutiny comes as tech companies increasingly act more like nation-states than corporations. Facebook now has a judicial branch; tech tycoons have reached orbit, going where only governments have gone before; and cryptocurrencies pose the greatest threat to the monetary power of governments since the invention of money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, governments are making supple use of technology for their own ends. Instead of giving aid and comfort to dissidents, tech is now being wielded to repress them. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/toolkit-nso-pegasus-iphone-android/">recent controversy over Israeli firm NSO Group</a> is only the latest example of dictators deploying sophisticated tools like ransomware to monitor their political opponents (or worse).</p>
<p>Tech might be a tactical tool, but it has become a strategic objective. Not since the U.S.-Soviet arms and space races has technology had such geopolitical salience. Huawei is only the most prominent example of tech competition as a proxy for geopolitics. From Taiwan to Sweden, Brussels to Beijing, tech policy and foreign policy are increasingly one and the same.</p>
<p>The truth is that from now on, the fate of states will depend more than ever on the technologies they hold. And the fate of technology companies more often than not will be intertwined with the states they reside in. Who controls the most advanced technology, experts say, will determine the world order<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/geopolitics/2021/09/the-nuclear-tinderbox-why-the-indo-pacific-is-the-new-arena-of-great-power-rivalry"> of the 21st century.</a> And after a multi-decade free-for-all, the time for choosing sides has arrived for many.</p>
<hr />
<p>So before we go any further, let me introduce myself. I’m a California native, a writer and policy wonk by background, who has lived in New York and spent time in Washington, London, and Paris. I’ve been a speechwriter, worked at a major foundation, consulted for political campaigns, and co-authored a best-selling book. While my focus is foreign policy and national security, I’ve also worked on a wide range of issues; at TechCrunch, I’ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/lets-give-tech-philanthropists-the-benefit-of-the-doubt-on-covid-19/">philanthropy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/startups-are-transforming-global-trade-in-the-covid-19-era/">trade</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">5G</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">US-China relations</a>.</p>
<p>While I will occasionally contribute to this series, my primary role will be as curator and editor. We’ve invited some of the world’s leading experts and practitioners to share their thoughts on how technology is impacting their field. From cyber to drones, AI to the future of democracy itself, our contributors will take you through the latest developments in their field and explain how tech is helping them chart a course for the future. They’ll connect the dots, so to speak, between bits and bombs, code and COVID, networks and nations.</p>

<p>There are some elephants in the room. Competition with China looms large, but so does cooperation with allies. With COP26 coming up in a bit more than a week, climate change – and the tech sector’s ability to make an impact – is vital. And understanding how technology’s power to bolster or undermine civic discourse is essential if we are to preserve democracy and protect human rights.</p>
<p>This week, we’re starting with pieces on several topics not always considered in connection with technology. Matt Rogers, co-founder of Nest, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/heres-how-startups-can-help-solve-climate-change/">writes about the role of startups in tackling climate change</a>. Phil Levy, chief economist at Flexport, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/decoupling-tech-supply-chains-would-do-more-harm-than-good/">discusses what &#8216;decoupling&#8217; from China would mean for tech supply chains</a>. And Robert Karanja of Omidyar Network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/digital-id-tech-is-moving-fast-goodid-will-ensure-it-doesnt-break-things/">explores the perils of digital ID</a> – and how it can be implemented securely and fairly.</p>
<p>This series is an experiment, and like the best software, we aim to iterate. Please share your thoughts with us and send us your ideas. Our goal in the weeks ahead is to elucidate, inform, and hopefully provoke a little bit too. I hope you’ll join us.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The best way to drive lasting change is to create opportunities where the right thing to do is also the easy thing to do. The upcoming COP26 climate conference has the unique opportunity to incentivize new talent to innovate and deploy the widest variety of solutions possible to make this happen.</p>
<p>When it comes down to a split-second decision or a force of habit, the average consumer will always choose the more convenient path, even if that path is the &#8220;wrong thing to do.&#8221; Technology, coupled with deep empathy for the user experience, has the opportunity to meet consumers where they are – to offer solutions that not only meet the bare minimum of conveniently solving a problem, but also do so in a way that is better for more people.</p>
<p>All too often, I see companies – tech and otherwise – lose sight of this principle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222802" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let’s take a long-institutionalized example: recycling. Everyone knows that recycling is key to reducing waste and, in turn, mitigating climate change. We simply cannot keep making waste at the same rate that we are currently. Recycling is an attempt to alleviate the waste burden on the planet. The concept of recycling is simple: reuse old things in new ways. However, when the average consumer is faced with a split second decision between the blue bin or black bin, it’s much easier to toss an item into the black bin rather than take the necessary step(s) to investigate the exact recyclability of that item.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at Nest, we knew that average households wasted a huge chunk of energy when the thermostats were left set at the same temperature all day. We also knew that the last thing busy people (and everyone is a busy person) needs is to remember to set or reset their thermostat based on weather patterns, time of day or energy consumption spikes.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to tell someone to turn their thermostat off, because it’s good for the planet. It’s another thing to simply turn off their thermostat for them, automagically. When we added automation, energy usage data, app controls and a design that makes temperature regulation feel cutting edge, we had a product that we knew would drive lasting change. On average, the Nest Learning Thermostat saved 10-12% energy on heating and 15% energy on cooling per household (more stats <a href="https://nest.com/thermostats/real-savings/https://nest.com/thermostats/real-savings/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At Nest, we made energy saving in the home the cool thing to do, sure. But that’s not all. We educated our customers to see their personal cost benefit as well as the planet’s. Nest made it easier and more convenient for the average consumer to do the right thing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But let’s zoom out from Nest.</p>
<p>This is a pivotal moment for technology to solve big problems. The biggest and most time-crucial of these problems being climate change. We have the opportunity to use the advancements we’ve achieved over the last few decades to make it easier for everyone — yes, everyone — to get involved with saving the planet. We need to create, fund, and champion technology that actually does good in tandem with doing well.</p>
<p>As an investor, I see tech companies either embracing or ignoring this principle every day. A few years ago, I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arch-rao">Arch Rao</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.span.io/">Span</a>, and was immediately struck with how his idea makes a cumbersome task easier and, in so doing, causes positive change. Today, it’s really hard to electrify your home. Sure, you could install a solar panel or a battery in your basement, but it’s challenging for home owners to know if these instruments are actually helping them to save energy. Span is an electric panel that lets the homeowner control every circuit in the home right remotely through a phone app. Span introduced user-centered design to an unsexy category: home electricity.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This begs the question: if we can apply human-centered design, technology, great UX and end-to-end product thinking to more areas (no matter how “boring”), what kind of solutions can we build? What kind of big problems could we solve?</p>
<p>We’ve made great progress in moving towards solar and renewables, but it’s not enough. We must plan and dedicate resources towards solutions across all industries. This call to action may start at tech, but it needs support from investors, non-profit advocacy groups, and policymakers. And we need the leaders gathered in Glasgow later this month to set out a roadmap of incentives. There are no silver bullets to climate change and there is no one person, idea or company that will solve it. It takes all of us, it takes all our ideas.</p>
<p>Simply put: people are motivated to do the right thing, but only so far as it is more convenient. As we build, let us embrace human nature as our challenge. Technology that stands the test of convenience will ultimately stand the test of time to drive lasting change. How can we make doing the right thing easier than doing the wrong thing? Figure that out, teach others how to do the same, and we will put ourselves a position to save the world.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For a technology sector that would much prefer to focus on growth over geopolitics, the push for U.S.-China “decoupling” poses an inescapable threat. The fuzziness of the concept only increases the danger.</p>
<p>U.S. distrust of China, particularly in technology, is nothing new. Indeed, Congress took action to keep Huawei and ZTE out of U.S. telecommunications almost a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-zte/u-s-lawmakers-seek-to-block-china-huawei-zte-u-s-inroads-idUSBRE8960NH20121008">decade</a> ago, during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>But during the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, there was a broad push to engage in dialogue and find common ground between the world’s two biggest economies. As China emerged as a leading global economy and became an increasingly important trading partner to the U.S., (<a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/index.html">accounting</a> for 2.5% of U.S. imports in 1989 and rising to a peak of 21.6% in 2017), there were moves to incorporate it into the U.S.-led global trading system. In 2005, Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick put forward the idea of China as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.ncuscr.org/sites/default/files/migration/Zoellick_remarks_notes06_winter_spring.pdf">Responsible Stakeholder,</a>” under the assumption that embracing China’s entry into the global trading system would ensure that it helped that system continue to function.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not long before that, the U.S. had agreed to China’s <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-04-02/was-letting-china-wto-mistake">2001 accession</a> to the World Trade Organization. But while it was seen by many as a turning point, it was really just a waypoint. That year, China’s share of U.S. imports was already 9.0%. Growth in Chinese imports, moreover, reflected a rebalancing of Asian trade more than anything else; from 1989 to 2017, Asia’s share (including China) of U.S. imports grew from 42.3% to just 45.2%. China’s relative growth instead ate into the share of countries like Japan and Malaysia, reflecting a reordering within Asia. The standard system of trade accounting overplayed this shift, as a good that was finished in China and had 10% Chinese value added would count as 100% Chinese for trade statistics.</p>
<p>Regardless of what was labeled as produced where, the bottom line was that a well-developed Asian supply chain incorporated China as a major player. With increased engagement, however, and very different economic systems, the points of economic disagreement between China and the United States accumulated. During the Trump administration, dialogue took a back seat to new <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide">trade barriers</a>. The United States applied tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports and China responded with barriers of its own. Although the Trump tariffs were initially cast as temporary measures meant to achieve finite policy objectives, some key policymakers within the Trump administration saw value in diminished interaction between the two countries.</p>
<p>Matthew Pottinger, who served as Deputy National Security Adviser under President Trump, subsequently <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2021-08-23/beijings-american-hustle">wrote</a> that “important U.S. institutions, especially in finance and technology, cling to self-destructive habits acquired through decades of ‘engagement,’ an approach to China that led Washington to prioritize economic cooperation and trade above all else.” His solution calls for bold steps “to frustrate Beijing’s aspiration for leadership in … high-tech industries.” The Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/04/china-tariffs-biden-trade-514996">announced</a>, after a prolonged review, that it was maintaining the Trump tariffs and Congress has pushed to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/senate-passes-bipartisan-tech-and-manufacturing-bill-aimed-at-china.html">fund initiatives</a> that would subsidize technological independence. These moves for lessening dependence, particularly in technology, have fallen under the broader rubric of “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5ca525f7-cb40-468a-a294-5938d11af6a5">decoupling</a>.”</p>
<p>Amidst all the newfound enthusiasm for U.S. decoupling from China, one might imagine that the term is well-defined. Yet it takes relatively little probing to discover a lack of clarity. Of course, the above-mentioned tariffs have served to discourage trade between the two countries, but how far is this policy meant to go?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Does decoupling mean the U.S. will turn away from inbound and outbound <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3149563/us-china-technology-fdi-crashes-decoupling-not-imminent">foreign direct investment</a>? What about portfolio investment, such as the purchase of U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/china-s-holdings-of-u-s-treasuries-hit-highest-since-july-2019%3Fsref=ZdtLveG1">Treasuries</a>? Does it mean that the U.S. should avoid importing final goods produced by Chinese firms? What about European firms producing in China? What about U.S. firms producing in China? Or European or U.S. firms producing outside China but incorporating Chinese parts? Or companies selling into the Chinese market and thus, presumably, subject to Chinese influence?</p>
<p>The sheer breadth of economic interactions between the two giant economies illustrates the implausibility of a clean divide between them. Instead, the most likely result of an attempt at exclusion would be another reordering, not China’s disappearance as a supply chain power. This is particularly true when other global economic powers, such as the European Union, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3146920/biden-cant-assume-europe-fully-board-us-china-policy">do not share</a> even the vague objective of decoupling.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The nebulous nature of the decoupling push poses a particular threat to the tech sector. Over decades, the push to take advantage of scale economies and to drive down production costs has resulted in highly-integrated global tech production. Further, in subsectors that have recently emerged as particularly contentious, such as the production of <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-illusion-of-decoupling-the-semiconductor-industry-latest-us-restrictions-on-china-short-sighted/">semiconductors</a>, investments have to be made at large scale and well in advance. That leaves the sector especially vulnerable to rapidly-shifting rule changes, as policymakers struggle to give substance to a problematic concept at a time of difficult supply chain disruptions. Policy responses that shower the sector with subsidies, as some bills in Congress have <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/chips/">proposed</a>, seem appealing, but lose their effectiveness when countries such as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f59173b6-211c-4446-aa57-5c9b78d602c2">Japan</a> move to match them.</p>
<p>A world in which the United States provides an extreme answer to the above questions and is absolutist in its separation from China is likely to be one in which the United States cripples itself technologically, denying itself <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/US-China-decoupling-easier-said-than-done-Western-Digital-CEO">access</a> to globally-competitive sourcing and empowering competitors elsewhere. The only politically viable alternative at the moment, a world in which the United States takes a more moderate stance and struggles to find a middle ground, is likely to be an unpredictable one in which rules are constantly evolving.</p>
<p>In either case, proponents of U.S.-China decoupling will find such a move counterproductive. Far from resolving strategic policy concerns, its primary impact may be to challenge U.S. technology leadership instead.</p>

Rapidly-developed mRNA COVID vaccines are themselves a case study in scientific and technological progress. Now efforts in the United States and Europe to require proof of said vaccination for a number of activities offer a preview of the immense opportunities possible as identification evolves – as well as a warning of its potential pitfalls if not done right.</p>
<p>In the United States, proof, for the moment anyway, is accomplished via a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/fake-covid-vaccine-cards-paper-format-open-to-outright-fraud">small piece of black and white paper</a> — or even just a picture of it — with details of one’s vaccination record often handwritten. It feels like an artifact from another era. Contrast that to the European Union’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">Digital COVID Certificate</a>. Its scannable QR code can instantly access data from government health systems revealing vaccination status, COVID-19 test results, and even acquired immunity from an infection.</p>
<p>The Digital COVID Certificate is an example of a digital ID. Governments are increasingly adopting these technologies in order to solve a global problem: the lack of official ID for <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">one billion people</a> around the world. This is a huge barrier to participating in modern society – limiting access to jobs, school and even engaging in the basic activities of everyday life. Digital IDs can make it easier and safer for individuals to bank, vote, travel, obtain government services, and safeguard their social media profiles and interactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222815" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But here’s the problem: digital IDs can also be used to restrict freedoms, increase surveillance, and actually make it harder to do many of the things they are supposed to facilitate. For example, over the last couple of years, concerns in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-health-tech/privacy-concerns-as-india-pushes-digital-health-plan-id-idUSKCN26D00B">India over privacy protections</a> — and in Kenya over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/world/africa/kenya-biometric-id.html">documentation requirements</a> that were excluding already marginalized communities — have made national digital ID programs contentious issues (indeed, the Kenyan High Court <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001426183/huduma-namba-declared-invalid">ruled</a> the IDs invalid after finding the government failed to properly safeguard citizen privacy in the rollout). Even in Europe, critics worry that its <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/16/covid-vaccine-passports-are-important-but-could-they-also-create-more-global-inequality">EU COVID</a> certificates could end up restricting the movements of people in low-income countries who can’t comply with the stringent “chain of trust” often involved in establishing digital IDs.</p>
<p>This is part of a larger trend over the last decade, with individuals at all levels of society becoming increasingly reliant – and to a certain extent captive – to digital tools and platforms outside of their control. This digital transformation has been given added urgency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to virtual interactions. If we are to fulfill the promise of digital ID systems, they must be paired with robust policies and the technical architecture that will ensure they expand rather than contract individuals’ rights and liberties.</p>
<p>More people need a voice to ensure these systems expand, rather than erode, freedoms and opportunities, but too often the needs, experiences, and rights of citizens, residents, and consumers are not considered in developing digital ID technologies and policies. These missed opportunities can lead to severe consequences—digital ID programs that jeopardize privacy, present security risks, and exclude, marginalize, and even endanger users. Governments and businesses that rely on such flawed programs risk data breaches, cyberattacks, economic consequences, and the loss of public trust.</p>
<p>In the last few years, a coalition of privacy and security advocates began working with businesses, governments, and civil society organizations to advance their shared belief in the many benefits of digital IDs—and address their equally intense concerns about their many risks. They developed a pathway for developing digital IDs so that they live up to a standard called <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/">Good ID.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Good ID approach involves following a framework of practices to design ID programs and policies that empower people to freely and safely engage with the digital world. Digital IDs should prioritize privacy and security and be treated as protected assets controlled by individuals and safeguarded by law. Good ID also elevates the importance of inclusion, transparency, and accountability. It promotes ways for individuals to play a major role in their own identity management. For example, a company in Canada is <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/articles/enhancing-digital-ids-for-canadian-tribes-still-shipping-paper-documents-in-the-us/">working with Indigenous communities</a> there to develop secure digital IDs that can make it easier to protect rights that are guaranteed by the federal government.</p>
<p>The push for Good ID has inspired a global movement that includes grassroots organizations like <a href="https://namati.org/">Namati</a> and <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/">Paradigm Initiative</a>, researchers like <a href="https://itsrio.org/pt/home/">ITS Rio</a> and <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/digital-pathways">Oxford University</a>, initiatives like <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a>, <a href="https://smartafrica.org/">Smart Africa</a> and <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>, institutions like the <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/projects/digital-identity">World Economic Forum</a>, philanthropic leaders like <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, as well as my own organization, <a href="http://omidyar.com">Omidyar Network</a>. The #GoodID movement has created dialogues while pursuing research and advocacy that engages residents, governments, technologists, and businesses.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Already, this global advocacy effort has influenced national debates in nearly 40 countries. At least 25 countries have adopted elements of Good ID. Most importantly, there are now some 1.2 billion people around the world who have access to better ID systems that allow them to more fully and safely engage in their societies, economies, and election processes. Yet the work of this community will continue until digital IDs everywhere become worthy of the public’s trust.</p>
<p>In the last five years, digital ID has evolved from a novel innovation to an increasingly common technology, one with far reaching implications that are prompting attention from a wide range of stakeholders. There is no going back, paper vaccination cards notwithstanding. Yet digital ID systems are being implemented so rapidly that the danger of getting it wrong — of causing harm — is palpable.</p>
<p>That’s why the global push to harness sophisticated, cutting-edge technologies to create digital ID systems can benefit from a focus on good policies, transparent processes, and accountability. The ethos of the tech community is famously to ‘move fast and break things.&#8217; With the #GoodID movement, we can reconcile that impulse when it comes to digitizing society with the needs, experiences, and rights of everyday citizens.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft. They were recommended to us through our survey; we'd love to know which software consultants you'd recommend to other startups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;In 2007, I, along with a few other colleagues, founded Arbisoft because we loved solving a variety of computing problems rather than staying close to one particular domain or technology vertical. We felt it was much easier to do that in a software services company than a software product company,&#8221; says Yasser Bashir, co-founder of Arbisoft. &#8220;In addition to our love for software development, we also had strong ideas on the kind of culture that would likely inspire smart people to do their best in a technology-focused organization. Arbisoft is a manifestation of many of those ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Anna Heim has interviewed Bashir from Arbisoft as part of our Experts project. They were recommended to us through our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey;</a> we&#8217;d love to know which software consultants you&#8217;d recommend to other startups. We also had guest columns focused on growth marketing about growth tactics and early-stage comm teams, but more on that below.</p>
<h2>Software Consulting</h2>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://arbisoft.com/">Arbisoft</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Omri Traub, CEO of <a href="https://www.popcart.com/">Popcart</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“We were able to create a high-performance dev team that includes dev, QA and DevOps. We had access to top talent and, importantly, elasticity in hiring. If we wanted to add a developer, we could have an incredible one join our team in under one week. It would have taken us weeks and months to recruit and hire a developer in Boston or the U.S.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.solwey.com/ ">Solwey Consulting</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Paul Shaked, <a href="https://sandlandsleep.com/">Sandland</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They helped us tremendously &#8212; a not so great dev team in Europe built our site with no documentation and lots of sloppy code, but Solwey was able to come in and sort through everything. Not to mention, our e-comm site is built on a headless CMS x Shopify checkout. Solwey was one of the only teams that was able to jump in and really get things to a good place with almost no major delays due to tech debt.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">Planetary</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Ryan Doney, <a href="https://getadlunam.com/">Ad Lunam </a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“I vetted several different consultancies, and Planetary not only brought technical expertise to the table, but their startup-specific mindset meant that it was incredibly easy to get aligned on our mission, and how to best build it. Josh is a great talent, and he&#8217;s built a remarkable team. Their work dramatically cut down our time to market, as well as giving us a ready-made jumping off point to start iterating on our product.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant:</strong> <a href="https://managedkube.com/">OpenCubicles</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“The OpenCubicles team helped us improve our infrastructure utilization, response time and other aspects critical to e-commerce success. We were able to rationalize cloud infrastructure costs due to thorough analysis and optimization. They helped us automate many aspects of operations. Would recommend to those looking for reliable technology services, especially e-commerce development.”</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="https://www.thinknimble.com/">ThinkNimble</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Philip Deng, <a href="https://grantable.co/">Grantable</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They are focused on helping startups succeed and they care deeply about the missions of the companies they help. They brought us way forward in terms of our design and also connected us with lots of thoughtful people beyond the company who have helped us move forward.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/arbisoft-co-founder-yasser-bashir-on-building-trust-with-early-stage-startups/">Arbisoft co-founder Yasser Bashir on building trust with early-stage startups:</a> Anna and Bashir spoke about how Arbisoft has grown over the past 13 years, how they build trust with their clients and the startup scene in Pakistan. Bashir says, &#8220;I have been very involved with the startup and tech ecosystem in the country since its inception. It is indeed taking off like a rocket ship right now, and we couldn’t be more excited about it. This year, startups raised more funding than all of the previous years combined. Arbisoft is excited because many of these startups need technology services, and therefore, we have a new and exhilarating market at our disposal.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Growth Marketing</h2>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Ki from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Ki has been supporting our business for over three years, and every time he finds unique ways to exceed expectations. From launching new products that sell out in days rather than weeks, being able to onboard new members of our team so they can contribute faster, and being someone that can work at a strategic level with our VPs and at the data-driven level with analysts, his range is truly outstanding and I believe he is in the 1% of the 1% of marketers.”</p>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> Kaveh from <a href="https://within.co/">WITHIN</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anonymous<br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> “Kaveh is one of the most empathetic and collaborative marketers I have ever worked with. Our team was largely brand marketers and Kaveh did a great job of bridging their world and our profit-optimized media strategy seamlessly (even if it meant an after-hours marketing jam session). Not only that, but you could tell he really cared about the brand, catching small issues with the site and sharing them with the team proactively, etc.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/smart-growth-tactics-can-put-account-based-marketing-within-reach-for-startups-and-smbs/">(TechCrunch+) Smart growth tactics put account-based marketing within reach for startups and SMBs:</a> Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, says, “F​​or many startups and SMBs, successfully setting up account-based marketing strategies can feel like a pipe dream. Startups still struggling to find product-market fit wouldn’t dream of being able to identify and map out their ideal customer profile (ICP) clearly enough. At the same time, small and midsize businesses often lack the resources to invest in elaborate multitouch-point content marketing strategies.” Van de Poel shares what account-based marketing is, the importance of mapping a customers journey to marketing content and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/hiring-is-just-the-first-step-when-building-an-early-stage-comms-team/">(TechCrunch+) Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team:</a> Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures, writes about not just the importance of having an early-stage comms team, but the importance of communicating with them. Khan says, “It’s not just important to have relationships between executives and media — you should have solid relationships with your comms people, too. Allow them to get to know you, your likes and dislikes, the environments in which you thrive and where you feel most comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Three Easy Steps to Capture Global Opportunities<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by KUDO</em><br />
As our economy becomes increasingly global, is your business prepared to succeed? KUDO co-founder and CEO Fardad Zabetian shares his insights on how to capture global opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Data Warehouse — The Foundation of the Modern Data Stack<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by RudderStack<br />
</em>The modern data stack is changing rapidly, with new technology emerging every day. Increasingly, though, architectures are being built around the data warehouse. In this panel discussion, Ben Gotfredson, global startup program manager at Snowflake, and Adam Gross, ex-CEO at Heroku, join RudderStack founder and CEO Soumyadeb Mitra to discuss why this new architecture has emerged, what specific technologies are driving the trend and what the data stack of the future looks like.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>9 Security Tips For Startups<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Vanta<br />
</em>When startups are in the beginning stages of growth, it becomes harder to balance between taking necessary security measures and bringing the product to market. You don’t want to slow iteration speed, but you also know that there are security steps that need to happen in order to grow the business. How do you balance these competing objectives? Christina Cacioppo, co-founder and CEO of Vanta, shares nine practical tips for building your product with security in mind and how to engage in conversations around security expectations from the start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">Disrupting Product Innovation<br />
</span></strong></span><em>Presented by Onshape, a PTC Business</em><br />
Innovation is a business imperative in today’s global economy. In fact, 84% of executives say innovation is key to their growth strategy, according to a McKinsey report. While companies need to innovate at scale to stay competitive, engineers need the right tools to avoid the many challenges associated with the product development process. In this session, hear Jon Hirschtick’s entrepreneurial journey and how cloud and SaaSification of the industry can accelerate product innovation as well as tips on scaling businesses into multimillion-dollar companies.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Accelerate your growth using agile market research throughout the product lifecycle<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by Momentive.ai<br />
</em>Conducting market research at each stage of your product lifecycle is a critical component to a successful product launch and sustained growth in an increasingly competitive market. While traditional market research can be costly and require a specialized team, agile market research software makes it possible for anyone on your team to get the insights you need fast. Join Momentive.ai to learn how to conduct your own market research to identify what kinds of products and features users value most, get insight into the competitive landscape and track your brand’s awareness and shifting perceptions over time.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How do High-growth Companies Use Technology to Inform Strategy and Drive Results?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>Fast-growing companies are in a constant state of transition, as high performance and growth can lead to ever-changing business priorities and challenges. Hear from a couple of SAP’s hypergrowth customers about how they use technology to inform their strategy and ultimately drive business results. SAP Managing Director, Midmarket and Ecosystem, Greg Petraetis will share how businesses grow from being innovators to disruptors to category leaders and how the technology they choose can impact the future of their business productivity.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Optimizing SaaS Productivity — Why SaaS Sprawl Prohibits Growth?<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by LeanIX</em><br />
SaaS represents an increasing share of the installed software estate — in cloud-born companies, often 100%. If not managed and optimized, an uncontrolled adoption leads to SaaS sprawl, sometimes called “Shadow IT.” Sub-optimized usage of SaaS subscriptions, increased risk and audit exposures will become a headache when scaling a business. André Christ, LeanIX co-founder and CEO, leads this talk illustrating frequent pitfalls and proposes the needed processes, skills and capabilities of the emerging SaaS management discipline for CEOs, CFOs and CIOs.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Things Fall Apart At $10MM ARR: Lessons For Growing Your SaaS Company<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by <span class="sponsors-label__sponsor-name">Vista Equity Partners<br />
</span></em>The strategies that get you to $10 million ARR look very different to those that get you to $50 million or even $100 million. At the $10 million growth inflection point, most software companies need to pivot their approach and often find they are facing new &#8212; often seemingly insurmountable &#8212; challenges. The team at Vista Equity Partners &#8212; one of the largest enterprise software investors in the world with over $81 billion AUM &#8212; have worked with many founders and companies to successfully bridge this transition. In this session, Rene Stewart, co-head of Vista’s growth-stage Endeavor Fund, discusses the missteps and misconceptions around software company growth and what you can do to achieve success that scales beyond $10 million ARR.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Taking Your People from Startup to Scale<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by SAP<br />
</em>As your business grows, you need to help your people grow with you. And, in a world that is transforming faster than ever, the methods of developing your team don’t cut it. In this session you’ll hear from Max Wessel, chief learning officer at SAP, about how to build a culture and workforce that is flexible, adaptable and fit for a rocket ship.</p>
<p><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation<br />
</strong></span><em>Presented by AKASA<br />
</em>Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, co-founder and CTO of AKASA, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/the-trump-spac-is-doing-stonk-things-which-is-hilarious/"><strong>Public markets welcome Trump SPAC:</strong></a> Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s new media company announced yesterday that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">go public via a SPAC-led transaction</a>. Today, investors spent quite a lot of money bidding up shares in the blank-check company that will take Trump Media and Technology Group public. In retrospect, however, of <em>course</em> the SPAC became a memestock given its lack of fundamentals or, well, product.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/snap-q-3-2021-earnings/"><strong>Snap suffers from supply-chain, Apple woes:</strong></a> U<strong>.</strong>S. social networking company Snap saw around a fifth of its value disappear today after it reported earnings following the end of trading yesterday. In short, despite a pretty good quarter, Snap’s growth expectations for Q4 were way under expectations. Why? Changes to iOS from Apple and supply-chain issues leading to reduced advertiser demand. TechCrunch also discussed how Snap’s issues help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">make the argument for Facebook’s metaverse push</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/"><strong>Brex raises again (again):</strong></a><strong> </strong>The corporate spend and expense reporting market can apparently absorb an infinite amount of capital, a fact that we learned again recently after TechCrunch broke the news that Brex once again raised more money at a higher price. This may kick off fundraising for Brex’s various competitors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have our usual run of startup news below, but before we get into that, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">spent a few words today thinking through Rent the Runway’s expected IPO price range</a> and how it stacks up against related companies. We have questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/intelligent-implants-seed-round/"><strong>Startup hopes to help you grow backbone:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We really shouldn’t make spine-based jokes given that someone will find them in poor taste, but <a href="https://twitter.com/haje">Haje Jan Kamps</a> started with his headline, so please direct all complaints in that direction. Regardless, Intelligent Implants has raised $8.7 million for its health-focused hardware that could help with back health.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/how-lunchclub-landed-a-preemptive-term-sheet-from-lightspeed/">How Lunchclub landed a preemptive term sheet from Lightspeed:</a></strong> One of TechCrunch’s best &#8212; if also best-hidden &#8212; talents, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a> wrote up a recent talk we had with a startup concerning how it managed to raise preemptive cash from a major investor. Founders, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/a16z-base-partners-cook-up-15m-in-funding-for-colombia-cloud-kitchen-concept-foodology/"><strong>More money for cloud kitchens:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The global effort to build and fund shared kitchens for meal prep tuned for delivery continues to attract capital; this time with a16z and Base Partners dicing up $15 million for Bogotá-based Foodology. Here’s hoping that the startup uses the funds to help make meals and doesn’t make a meal out of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/pledge-raises-4-5m-seed-round-to-build-a-carbon-measurement-and-removal-api/"><strong>Transport companies can now “Pledge” to offset their carbon footprint:</strong></a> A startup called Pledge wants to help “freight forwarding, ride-hailing, travel and last-mile delivery” companies dispense with the implicit carbon costs of their businesses. The startup just raised $4.5 million from “Visionaries Club with participation from Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital and Zinal Growth,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/india-ofbusiness-in-talks-to-raise-new-funds-at-over-4-5-billion-valuation/"><strong>OfBusiness in talks to raise again (again!):</strong></a> Er, OfBusiness is back in our pages. The company raised money this April. And last month. And now it is doing so again. This time at a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, TechCrunch reports. That’s a 50% bump from its last round.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiring is just the first step when building an early-stage comms team</h2>
<p>There are a few places where founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them. Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later.</p>
<p>Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/accountable-tech-mainstreet-against-big-tech/"><strong>Tech watchdog isn’t big on Big Tech’s leverage of small biz for PR:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Facebook and other tech giants love to tell you stories about how their products and services help one small business or another. It’s a way of both humanizing megacorps and creating a smokescreen to avoid more lucid scrutiny. Main Street Against Big Tech is spending money to push back on the matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/"><strong>SpaceX’s Starship rocket could fly as soon as next month:</strong></a> But it will need regulatory approval, TechCrunch reports. Regardless, the news is good for you spaceheads out there — the sooner SpaceX can move the commercial space industry forward by another peg, the sooner its competitors will have to catch up, benefiting us all.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/revue-now-lets-you-subscribe-to-newsletters-directly-on-your-twitter-timeline/"><strong>Twitter now allows users to subscribe to Revue newsletters in their timelines:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Twitter is probably going to get away with favoring its own product given its modest scale when set next to companies like Facebook, but its product work on Revue — a newsletter product it previously bought — is turning heads all the same. Twitter is currently taking on two well-known a16z bets, namely Substack (with Revue) and Clubhouse (with Spaces).</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage entrepreneurs who are eager to ship usually spend more time calculating their startup’s monthly burn rate than selecting an optimal development environment.</p>
<p>As a result, technical debt starts to accumulate. And accumulate.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Senior Writer Romain Dillet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/how-do-you-select-the-right-tech-stack/">interviewed Jill Wetzler, VP of Engineering at Pilot, and Preeti Somal, EVP of Engineering at HashiCorp</a>, to learn more about how they evaluate third-party vendors, select open-source components and think ahead with regard to engineering capabilities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222614" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>“All you’re doing that sprint is working off your tech debt backlog,” said Somal. “I think the really key thing is to recognize it, find a strategy to work with it, and don’t let it build to a point where it just feels like you’re going to take a massive hit on productivity.”</p>
<p>Their discussion, which took place at TechCrunch Disrupt, also addressed the value of using test suites and selecting a reliable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) framework.</p>
<p>“What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast?” asked Wetzler. “Because I think that is the name of the game when you’re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<p>Offering consumers affordable options for high-end clothing and accessories is innovative, but Rent the Runway’s recent IPO filing makes the company’s “overall business profile” look “unsteady,” writes Alex Wilhelm in today’s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>But because its price range indicates that Rent the Runway is a unicorn in waiting, “we have to take it seriously.”</p>

<p>The tide is high for startup founders who are looking to raise their first round in October 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But easy money can create special pressure for early-stage founders, according to Lightup.ai founder Manu Bansal.</p>
<p>“You can’t speed up GTM with more money. If valuations go up astronomically, I remind myself that I have to deliver performance,” he says.</p>
<p>“If I cannot show traction, sooner or later this beast will come back to haunt me. I’d rather avoid the price runners.”</p>

<p>Plaid has steadily expanded its payments toolkit for years, but yesterday, it unveiled new services that integrate its infrastructure deeper with partners’ payment flow.</p>
<p>It is a potential game-changer, as millions of merchants “now have a low-cost alternative to avoid credit card processing fees that cut into their margins,” writes Ryan Lawler.</p>

<p>Fintech in Latin America is on fire, and nowhere more so than in Mexico — startups in the sector roped in nearly 20% of all capital invested in the region last year.</p>
<p>“Considering that nearly 40 million people in Mexico (almost a third of the population) are unbanked, fintech has been a necessary vehicle for fresh routes for credit, insurance and remittances,” writes Jen Laloup, CEO of Mobile Growth Association.</p>

<p>Technology should enhance customer service operations, but automation can risk making the experience feel a little robotic.</p>
<p>Joyce Lee, Alorica’s chief culture officer, shares four actionable steps companies can take to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with an inclusive onboarding process.</li>
<li>Host interactive forums.</li>
<li>Implement an ongoing speaker series.</li>
<li>Define your commitment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Udemy targets valuation of $4B in major edtech IPO</h2>

<p>In other IPO news, edtech provider Udemy could well be worth more than $4 billion after its upcoming debut, which it expects to price at $27-$29 per share.</p>
<p>“It’s a modest bump in worth for the company, which was last valued at $3.32 billion during its $50 million November raise,” write Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm, who studied its S-1/A filing.</p>
<p>But slowing revenue growth means the company will need to convince potential investors that its business has more mountains to climb.</p>
<p>“While few would argue that digitization and rapid re-skilling are impacting workforces across the world, some may need to be convinced that enterprise edtech is the solution to the resulting gaps.”</p>

<p>There are a few places where startup founders can cut corners, but your first comms hire is not one of them.</p>
<p>Companies that choose not to invest in finding the best person for this role will inevitably regret it later. Since these are the people tasked with bringing your message to the outside world, &#8220;look for a strategic partner rather than a manager,&#8221; advises Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should be able to discuss your product and industry as well as anyone on your sales team. If that sounds like a tall order, it is — yet another reason to properly invest in the role.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zillow announced that it was hitting pause on its iBuying operations earlier this week, but rival Opendoor says it is expanding operations and plowing ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Zillow announced that it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/zillow-pauses-home-purchases-as-snags-hit-tech-powered-flipping?sref=1SlQD502">hitting pause on its iBuying operations</a> earlier this week, the news sent shockwaves through the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Zillow blamed the pause on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-gets-outplayed-at-its-own-game-11634551201">labor and supply constraints</a> that were hampering its ability to quickly renovate and efficiently turn over its housing inventory. The announcement sent Zillow’s stock plummeting 10% in the day after the report, while driving competitor Opendoor higher.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The key to Opendoor’s recent market expansion can be tied to a fundamental retooling of its playbook for launching in a new city or region.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Given the overlap between operations &#8212; Opendoor is in 23 of the 25 markets where Zillow was purchasing homes &#8212; there was some question about whether Opendoor was affected by the same shortages. But while Zillow is pulling back, Opendoor says it is plowing ahead.</p>
<p>Over the past nine months, Opendoor has aggressively expanded operations and has been growing its inventory. The company purchased 8,500 homes in the second quarter &#8212; more than double Zillow’s tally &#8212; and said it had contracts to purchase another 8,200 homes in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Shortly after Zillow confirmed the pause in its iBuying operation, Opendoor issued a statement which said, “We know how important certainty and convenience are to homeowners seeking to move and we’ve worked hard over the past seven years to ensure we can continue to deliver our experience at scale. Opendoor is open for business and continues to scale and grow.”</p>
<p>Basically, Opendoor has no plans to slow down anytime soon. The company can cite a combination of proprietary data, centralized operations and an increasingly digital process for evaluating homes and making offers as just some of the reasons why it has been able to more than double the number of markets it operates in over the past nine months.</p>
<h2>Data, data, everywhere</h2>
<p>The key to any successful iBuying business is the use of data to make a competitive offer to sellers while also having a strong understanding of the price you can expect to garner when you put the home back up for sale.</p>
<p>That data, and how you model it, becomes even more crucial in a dynamic real estate market like the one that has emerged over the past 18 months, where historically low interest rates and unprecedented demand constrained inventory and led to home price appreciation in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>“Our job as a company is to provide a really compelling and competitive offer to sellers,” said Opendoor CTO Ian Wong. “If we can&#8217;t offer a competitive offer on the single largest asset most people have, they simply won&#8217;t take [it].”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like it or not, memes are part of how we communicate now &#8212; we even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/the-trump-spac-is-doing-stonk-things-which-is-hilarious/">reference memes</a> in our headlines. But iterating upon existing memes can be a needlessly <a href="https://imgflip.com/">clunky</a> user experience. First, you need to find a meme template, then you need to figure out how to add text, even if that means reverse-engineering Instagram story drafts into photo-editing software.</p>
<p>But instead of scrolling through Google images, looking for a clean template of the latest meme, <a href="https://antimatter.systems/">Antimatter</a>&#8216;s Reverse Meme Search app, released today for web and iOS, does the work for you. Just upload a meme, and the app will return you a blank slate. You can even long press a photo on apps like Reddit and Twitter, and when iOS prompts you to choose where to share the image, you can click on the Reverse app icon. Once the template is identified, you can use the app&#8217;s built-in photo editor to add text to the meme and choose the text&#8217;s font, color, size and location. You can&#8217;t use comic sans on the app, which feels like an intentional omission.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etCL7CXlbQo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch tested the app&#8217;s capabilities &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/the-red-flag-meme-is-a-red-flag-for-accessibility/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Spider-Man pointing meme</a> was easy enough to reverse engineer, but we quickly stumped the Reverse Meme Search with a deep-fried Owen Wilson meme (it&#8217;s the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xgRdTevf9P4/maxresdefault.jpg">first result on Google Images</a> when you search &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmm885/how-to-deep-fry-a-meme">deep-fried memes</a>,&#8221; but not necessarily a template itself). But, fear not, the app comes with a free Meme Concierge. Less than an hour after submitting our request, we received an email with the subject, &#8220;We found your template: Owen Wilson Deep Fried Meme.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, even those of us who got fine arts minors in college and still borrow the university&#8217;s Adobe subscription (don&#8217;t tell them!) probably couldn&#8217;t cleanly edit the text and emojis off of a deep-fried meme on Photoshop (or, we just have other things to do). So this is actually a useful service, even if the &#8220;Meme Concierge&#8221; is just, as the email says, &#8220;a human with 16 GB of RAM and two USB-C ports.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antimatter founder Jonathan Libov wouldn&#8217;t tell us how the app works &#8212; is it essentially just a reverse image search, where the app needs to recognize what meme you&#8217;re looking for to send back the template you want? Or does the app use some tech wizardry to automatically clear the text from the image? It&#8217;s probably a reverse image search, seeing as we stumped the app with deep-fried Owen Wilson, but now, anyone who tries to make their own deep-fried Owen Wilson meme won&#8217;t need to use the concierge, because the template is now in their system. I even checked their work, uploading a copy of the image with added text.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;We envision this app as Instapaper and Pinterest plus Figma. The two key features are (A), collecting visuals (eventually more than just meme templates &#8212; any visual that you find useful and meaningful) that you (B), store in your library,&#8221; Libov told TechCrunch. &#8220;Antimatter is actually a P2P learning and education company, and Reverse Meme Search is part of the creation experience that we just wanted the world to have sooner rather than later.&#8221; Antimatter says on its <a href="https://antimatter.systems/">website</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;inspired by the many great learning meme communities on the internet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">introduced</a> a new set of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Guidelines</a> that include three key changes. One of the changes is the result of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">previously announced</a> settlement agreement with a class of U.S. app developers. It clarifies that developers are allowed to communicate with their customers about other payment methods available outside their app. Related to this, another new guideline explains that apps may request customer information like name and email, but the request must be optional for the user and shouldn&#8217;t prevent them from using the app.</p>
<p>The third guideline is unrelated to legal action, and simply details how developers can use a new App Store feature, called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=zghdvfza">in-app events</a>, which rolls out next week.</p>
<p>In August, Apple first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">announced</a> it had reached a proposed settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed against it in 2019 by a group of U.S. app developers. The agreement included a few items, but the biggest was that developers would be able to share information with their users about how to pay for purchases outside their iOS app and the App Store. At the time, Apple said the changes would clarify that developers &#8220;can use communications, such as emails, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As always, developers will not pay Apple a commission on any purchases taking place outside of their app or the App Stores,&#8221; Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-us-developers-agree-to-app-store-updates/">had also said</a>.</p>
<p>Now those proposed changes are officially part of the App Store Guidelines.</p>
<p>Specifically, Apple deleted a clause from guideline 3.1.3 that had previously said developers were not permitted to use information obtained within their app to target individual users outside of the app to use purchasing methods other than Apple&#8217;s own in-app purchases. The old rule had also said this would include sending out emails to the address on file obtained when the customer signed up for the app.</p>
<p>With this clause gone, developers are no longer barred from those sorts of communications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple also added a new section to guideline 5.1.1 (x) that explains further how developers may go about requesting user contact information. It says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps may request basic contact information (such as name and email address) so long as the request is optional for the user, features and services are not conditional on providing the information, and it complies with all other provisions of these guidelines, including limitations on collecting information from kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rules against contacting customers, or what is referred to as &#8220;anti-steering&#8221; guidelines, is an area that has become the subject of much regulatory scrutiny in recent months. Lawmakers around the world have been working to determine if Apple is acting as a monopolist by limiting how developers can run their own businesses in terms of customer outreach, marketing and payment systems choice.</p>
<p>Already, Apple was being forced to adjust its App Store rules due to various settlements in specific markets.</p>
<p>South Korea, for instance, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed</a> new legislation that bans Apple and Google from requiring that developers use their respective payment systems. In Japan, Apple last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">reached a settlement</a> with regulators over &#8220;reader&#8221; apps that now allows them to link to their own websites from within their apps.</p>
<p>In the U.S., meanwhile, Apple is engaged in a lawsuit with Fortnite maker Epic Games. Though the case is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">now under appeal</a>, the judge&#8217;s original ruling would have required Apple to allow developers to point to their own websites within their apps, where customers could then pay directly for its services or subscriptions, bypassing Apple&#8217;s payment systems in the process.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s changes don&#8217;t go so far as to allow alternative payment systems to be embedded directly in their apps, however.</p>
<p>The anti-steering updates are only one area where regulatory pressure has been playing a role in pushing the tech giants to adopt new policies.</p>
<p>Apple and Google have both also adjusted their commission structures to lower their cut of developers&#8217; revenues in different ways, including for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">smaller businesses</a>, apps that provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/">access to media</a> and apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">run by news publishers</a>. Google this week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/google-lowers-play-store-fees-to-15-on-subscriptions-apps-as-low-as-10-for-media-apps/"> lowered its fees to 15%</a> for subscription-based apps from day one, instead of 30% during the first year which lowered to 15% in year two. It also lowered commissions to as much as 10% for specific media apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222558" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222558" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2222558 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2048-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222558" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The other new rule arriving today is related to in-app events and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">simply guidance as to how the new feature can be used. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-to-introduce-a-b-testing-and-in-app-events-to-the-app-store/">Announced at WWDC</a>, in-app events give app makers a better way to showcase things taking place inside their apps, like game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences and more. The events will begin to appear on the App Store starting on October 27 with the release of the iOS 15.1 update.</p>
<p>Apple advises developers to ensure the metadata is accurate and related to the event specifically when entered in App Store Connect and that the events must run on the dates selected, including across multiple storefronts. It also specifies the deeplink must launch the event directly when tapped, and notes events can be monetizable.</p>
<p>All three rule <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">changes</a> are live as of today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Co-founded in 2007 by Yasser Bashir, <a href="https://arbisoft.com/">Arbisoft</a> falls on the larger end of the spectrum of software development partners that our readers have recommended in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">our ongoing survey</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the company has a few hundred employees distributed across Pakistan, Australia, Texas and Malaysia, but it continues to service startups of all sizes, says Bashir.</p>
<p>Omri Traub, CEO of e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.popcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popcart</a>, told TechCrunch that their company has worked with Arbisoft since its early stages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had access to top talent and, importantly, elasticity in hiring. If we wanted to add a developer, we could have an incredible one join our team in under one week,&#8221; said Traub. &#8220;It would have taken us weeks and months to recruit and hire a developer in Boston or the U.S.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Anna Bailey, product manager at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/ad-supported-ev-charging-network-developer-volta-raises-125-million/">Volta Charging</a>, &#8220;help [from Arbisoft] has allowed us to build reliably and at a large scale without having to burden our internal engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spoke to Bashir to learn more about how Arbisoft works with its clients, most of whom &#8220;have either closed or are about to close Series A rounds,&#8221; he said. In our conversation, he discussed agile development, data science, customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Can you briefly tell us about your background and what inspired you to create Arbisoft?</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Yasser Bashir:</strong> I was 10 when my father bought me and my brother a Commodore 64. In the little town that I grew up in, we were among the only three families that owned a computer. I know very few people who used one of those C-64 machines in the 80s and didn&#8217;t end up loving computers or computer science. I was no exception. I went on to get an undergraduate degree in computer science from the top CS school in my home country and later ended up at Stanford University for a graduate degree.</p>
<p>Each of those steps paved the way, in one way or another, toward a career in computing in general and the creation of a technology company in particular.</p>
<p>In 2007, I, along with a few other colleagues, founded Arbisoft because we loved solving a variety of computing problems rather than staying close to one particular domain or technology vertical. We felt it was much easier to do that in a software services company than a software product company.</p>
<p>In addition to our love for software development, we also had strong ideas on the kind of culture that would likely inspire smart people to do their best in a technology-focused organization. Arbisoft is a manifestation of many of those ideas.</p>
<p><b>How has Arbisoft evolved since its creation 13 years ago, and and how did it grow?</b></p>
<p>What started with three people in 2007 is now one of the most successful software companies in our region. We have almost 750 people, mostly engineering staff, and we are software development partners for many organizations that are leaders in their verticals, including KAYAK, MIT, edX, Insurify and many others.</p>
<p>Almost all of our growth has been organic; companies that have had a great experience of outsourcing their software development needs to us strongly recommend our services to others. Not surprisingly, we consistently get a net promoter score of 75 or above from our customers in our biannual NPS surveys. Our growth is a direct consequence of our customers promoting us to others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>How is your team structured?</b></p>
<p>Arbisoft is structured as a network of independent, cross-functional teams. Each team is typically working on just one client project at any given time. We strongly believe in autonomous, self-managed teams that are agile and constantly evolving to improve their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Among the many books that have shaped my thinking on organizational structures, one of the most important is Frédéric Laloux&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Reinventing Organizations.&#8221;</a> His concepts for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teal organizations</a> are very ambitious — sometimes overly idealistic — but definitely paint a picture of an organization that is way more evolved than the majority of companies in the world today. In shaping our team structures, we have borrowed many ideas from the book.</p>
<p><b>What range of services do you provide? Why did you choose to go full-stack and beyond?</b></p>
<p>Our range of services, by virtue of our size, is pretty wide. We provide full-stack web and mobile app development, DevOps for cloud computing, machine learning, AI, UI/UX/product design, project management, and manual and automated software QA. Basically, we provide most, if not all, of the services that may be needed by a modern tech startup to get to a production-ready solution. Beyond launch, we continue to support our customers with maintenance, bug fixing and new feature development.</p>
<p><b>Among your clients, at what stages are the startups that you work with? How early-stage can they be?</b></p>
<p>We work with startups across all stages of their evolution, but more typically with ones that have either closed or are about to close Series A rounds. There is no restriction on the startup stage as such though. For the right idea, we can start at its very inception.</p>
<p><b>How do you build trust with your clients that make them potentially willing to rely on Arbisoft for all of their engineering needs?</b></p>
<p>Openness and transparency are fundamental enablers of the trust our clients have in us. We make sure we represent our capabilities exactly how they are so that we can set the right expectations and exceed them whenever possible. Our teams working on client projects are seamlessly embedded into the clients&#8217; own teams and, for all practical purposes, work as if they are a part of the clients&#8217; business.</p>
<p>Vulnerability also plays a role in building that trust — when we make mistakes, we are open about sharing them and learning from them, so that they are not repeated. Other agile principles help too but <i>blameless retros</i> are probably the most effective tool in openly discussing and learning from mistakes.</p>
<p><b>Can you tell us more about the data side of Arbisoft?</b></p>
<p>For quite a few of our customers, our primary service is collecting, cleaning, analyzing and presenting data. We have developed deep expertise in libraries and frameworks that assist with our data science practice. From the get-go (no pun intended), Python was one of our go-to languages. Luckily, Python is one of the strongest languages for dealing with data. Libraries like Scrapy, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly, etc. come in really handy for all of our data science needs and we have pretty deep expertise in them.</p>
<p><b>You also built <a href="https://arbisoft.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solutions</a> such as Edly, ListenTool and more — can you tell us about these and why you are doing it?</b></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great question. Considering that Arbisoft is a reasonably sized organization now, we often need technology to manage our processes more efficiently and maintain our leadership position as a software services provider. When we are unable to find a good match for our needs, we build solutions to solve our own problems. If it works for us, we then productify the solution so it can solve similar problems for other organizations.</p>
<p>For example, we built <a href="https://listentool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ListenTool</a> because Arbisoft is big on frequent, instance-based feedback. We built <a href="https://edly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edly</a> because we found ourselves frequently building custom learning management systems (LMS) for our customers and it seemed natural to abstract many of the complexities of an online learning solution into a customizable product offering.</p>
<p>This has been a successful strategy and we are likely to continue building such products in the future as well. We are also spinning off some of these products into organizations that can sustain and grow themselves independently of Arbisoft.</p>
<p><b>Why do you have offices in Texas, Australia and Malaysia in addition to Pakistan, and what are the advantages of this setup and locations?</b></p>
<p>Most of these locations are front offices closer to where our customers are. Since 80% of our customers are in the U.S., it really helps to have a presence on the ground. We have our customers nicely distributed between the West Coast (San Francisco) and East Coast (New York and Boston) so having an office in the middle optimizes time overlap and travel. Our customers can get the high availability and service quality of an onshore provider with the cost and other benefits of an offshore operation. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><b>Pakistan&#8217;s tech scene seems to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/pakistans-growing-tech-ecosystem-is-finally-taking-off/">taking off</a>. What has been your involvement with it personally, and what impact does this growing ecosystem have for Arbisoft if any?</b></p>
<p>I have been very involved with the startup and tech ecosystem in the country since its inception. It is indeed taking off like a rocket ship right now, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited about it. This year, startups raised more funding than all of the previous years combined. Arbisoft is excited because many of these startups need technology services, and therefore, we have a new and exhilarating market at our disposal. We have a great brand and most businesses look at Arbisoft as one of the most reliable and dependable technology partners they can hope to have. So the demand for our services has surged by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p><b>What are some arguments for Arbisoft to attract and retain talent?</b></p>
<p>Arbisoft is known for having a great organizational culture — we care deeply about our people and create opportunities for them to constantly learn and grow their capabilities. I’d have to say that is the primary reason people come to Arbisoft and stay. We have one of the lowest turnover rates in the industry. When people do leave, it&#8217;s usually for opportunities outside the country or ambitions like higher education. Invariably, you will find Arbisoft alumni to be our best ambassadors, who are not only helping us find new talent to replace them but also redirecting new business to us.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the tech industry, diversity is a hot topic. We’ve seen companies such as Facebook and Google commit to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in hopes of improving their company culture. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">analysis shows</a> that there has been no appreciable change in diversity for these allegedly DEI-driven companies over the past 10 years despite these efforts.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, many tech companies made their annual diversity reports public to demonstrate transparency. Still, a problem emerges when reviewing the data: While the reports often describe incremental gains or losses in diversity numbers, they often fail to analyze data that can help the company make tangible change.</p>
<h2>Using data to dig deeper into systems that impact diversity</h2>
<p>The data in these reports provide us with a statement of the outcomes. We can see if the company has had growth or decline in the measured areas of diversity &#8212; typically demographic representation. What we can&#8217;t see is why these outcomes are happening and at what point in the system we&#8217;re missing the mark.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Therefore, these reports miss out on the powerful accountability effects of measuring improved processes and systems.</p>
<p>To illustrate an example, we&#8217;ll look at a company&#8217;s marketing data.</p>
<p>When a large corporation is trying to optimize its marketing funnel, it can see data at every level of the marketing process. For example, they can estimate the number of impressions they receive from external marketing efforts, quantify the number of conversions from ads to their website and calculate how many website visitors convert to customers. This information is used regularly to optimize performance and increase sales &#8212; and it&#8217;s prioritized because leaders know that revenue generation is essential for the company to succeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leaders can accomplish this quality of analysis at the hiring level by recording and analyzing data at every level of the recruiting system. Data sets would include demographic information for every point of interaction, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of impressions received for a job ad.</li>
<li>Candidates identified through sourcing channels.</li>
<li>Candidates being presented for interviews.</li>
<li>Interviewer assessment results.</li>
<li>Job offers and job offers accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders could then ensure demographic representation at each level of the process is at least equivalent to the demographics of the available talent pool. The company would then need to prioritize using this data to make changes to the system regularly (not annually) to improve the results.</p>
<p>Recruiting is only one example, and there are other areas of business that can benefit from more informative diversity data.</p>
<h2>Making information actionable</h2>
<p>As a leader, you have a choice to make your data actionable by publishing information that can result in accountability and greater equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Consider sharing each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay transparency and pay equity by demographic.</li>
<li>Engagement and inclusion data by demographic.</li>
<li>Rates of promotion by demographic.</li>
<li>Rates of retention by demographic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, your general counsel’s skin may crawl at these recommendations. However, organizations innovating on talent, culture and equity are willing to wander into these territories of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have seen organizations that are willing to stand on their integrity wholeheartedly by publishing these data make significant progress toward building cultures of belonging that center on diversity.</p>
<h2>Data transparency doesn&#8217;t equal data <em>accountability</em></h2>
<p>We often believe that if we can measure something, we can change it; however, measurement alone does not drive change. Therefore, it’s crucial to measure the right data elements while holding stakeholders accountable for measurable change.</p>
<p>Let’s consider how this is done in sales.</p>
<p>Sales teams measure individual performance based on their contribution to achieving revenue targets. They are <em>required </em>to get results or risk losing their job because failure can cause harm to the business.</p>
<p>If we did the same for DEI, we&#8217;d see leaders held accountable for getting tangible results quarterly or annually as part of their performance appraisal goals. But, unfortunately, putting out a report stating what occurred won’t inspire leaders to do more to change the processes that impact outcomes meaningfully.</p>
<h2>Benchmarking against already low numbers won&#8217;t move the needle</h2>
<p>Diversity reporting often benchmarks annual data against the company&#8217;s previous metrics, the industry as a whole, companies of a similar size or an entire geography (i.e., the U.S.). This form of measuring progress makes incremental progress seem like a bigger achievement than it is. Leaders can point to this data and say they are meeting industry standards, but if the industry’s rate of progress is negligible, it simply removes accountability for achieving better results. Organizations have not been getting diversity right for decades, why benchmark to those underperforming?</p>
<p>Let’s say this simply: Benchmarking to poor performance is a poor practice.</p>
<p>If you do a benchmark, at least seek to make a real improvement by benchmarking against companies performing in the top quartile when it comes to diversity representation. But, again, this sets the bar higher and challenges leaders to be more strategic.</p>
<p>More importantly, companies should benchmark against the available talent pool (by using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> data in the U.S., or by <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/">graduation rates by demographic and field of study</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span> to determine underrepresentation within your geography, industry and job field.</p>
<p>For example, the rate of graduation among women computer science majors is dramatically higher than the representation of women in junior-level software engineering roles in most companies.</p>
<p>And yet, even BLS data can be flawed because it relies on several assumptions about who is eligible for employment and excludes whole swaths of truly employable people. So, you may also combine these benchmarks with <em>local </em>population data as yet another data set to show how effective you’ve been.</p>
<p>If tech companies publish data that not only describes what is currently happening in the organization but also gives context to how systemic bias impacts diverse talent who cannot access their organizations, these reports might motivate behavioral change and be more valuable for readers from other industries aspiring to improve their own organizational outcomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spinal surgery is not for the faint of heart at the best of times, but <a href="http://intelligentimplants.ie">Intelligent Implants</a> raised €7.5 million ($8.7 million) to make spinal surgery less of a pain in the backside. The company&#8217;s smart implants&#8217; first application is in spinal fusion surgery &#8212; where two or more vertebrae are permanently connected to improve stability, correct a deformity or reduce pain. Globally, more than a million of these surgeries are performed, but they are typically seen as a last resort because of the risk of complications or continued pain after the operation.</p>
<p>Intelligent Implants uses wireless implantable electronics to stimulate, steer and monitor bone growth. The company points out that the current state-of-the-art post-operation management is potentially long-term dependence on physical therapy and/or painkillers. Intelligent Implants is wading into the market to add a more tech-forward solution to the mix.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s smart, active implants aren&#8217;t the first devices in this category. You&#8217;ll be familiar with pacemakers and cochlear implants, which have been available since the 1950s and 1970s, respectively. Intelligent Implants’s innovation is in creating a solution that doesn&#8217;t require wires or batteries. The product is placed between vertebrae with the same standard surgical procedure as current non-active implants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The implant is then powered externally through induction, much like how your phone might use a wireless charging pad. This creates an electric field that stimulates and guides bone growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish this surgery on anyone, but if you have to do it, we have to make sure that the outcomes are as good as they can be,&#8221; said John Zellmer, CEO of Intelligent Implants.</p>
<p>The electrodes that are used for stimulation can also be used as sensors. The device consists of a standard orthopedic implant, with some additional magic thrown in. The magic, in this case, is a number of electrodes that can be used for neuromodulation to aid bone growth, along with some antennas and electronics to control it all. After fusion surgery, the patients wear a spinal corset to keep everything in place where it is meant to be &#8212; and that&#8217;s a convenient place to keep the power and control units for the device.</p>
<p>Zellmer explains that Intelligent Implants get the sensor side of the equation almost as a side effect of the bone-growth stimulation. He explains that the device can do impedance measurements. Bone doesn&#8217;t conduct very well, so when the graft material is gradually replaced by bone in the body, the electrical signature changes, and in the process you can measure the bone growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company&#8217;s product &#8212; called SmartFuse &#8212; just received a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/breakthrough-devices-program">Breakthrough Device designation</a> from the FDA, which, among other things, means that the government agency believes that &#8220;the device provides for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions.&#8221; The company explains that, in order to be part of the program, it completed large-animal trials on sheep, which showed three times more bone growth and cut the time to fusion down by 50%.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is pretty uncommon to get a Breakthrough Device Designation based on pre-clinical data,&#8221; said Zellmer, who points out that most BDDs are based on human trials. &#8220;We definitely did a big dance around the office when we got the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has so far been using sheep for its trials to date &#8212; sheep or goats being the most commonly used animals for orthopedic trials. The company is aiming to do its first human clinical trials in 2023.</p>
<p>“After a family member suffered from poor outcomes we decided to tackle this hard problem. We knew our solution would only work if our team had strong domain knowledge, long-term commitment and if we could fit our technology into the current practices (standard-of-care) of surgeons,&#8221; said Zellmer. &#8220;We are now more than halfway in bringing our product SmartFuse to market, and the FDA’s decision is a confirmation that our approach was sound.”</p>
<p>The company was part of the SOSV <a href="https://hax.co/">HAX</a> tech program, before graduating and announcing it is closing its seed round today. It raised €4.5 million ($5.2 million) from EU’s <a href="https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-funding-opportunities/eic-accelerator_en">EIC Accelerator</a>, with participation from <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>, and an additional €3 million ($3.5 million) from a group of Swedish angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We met the SOSV partner Bill Liao back in 2015, and he has been supporting us ever since. That&#8217;s a long time for a venture firm, and they have done a really amazing job, both in terms of helping us from an operational perspective, but also supporting us in every round since then,&#8221; says Zellmer. &#8220;I think that is spectacular: We are doing something really hard here. This is a Class 3 device, an active implantable device with a stimulation system. What we are doing is totally new, and bringing that into the orthopedics field shows vision and guts.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Creating implantable technology is about as hard as it gets, and Intelligent Implants have been tremendously steady in its progress. We are proud to keep supporting them on this journey to help millions of patients and serve a market poised to reach $9B in a few years”, says Bill Liao, general partner at SOSV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In less than seven days, Lunchclub co-founder Vlad Novakovski had a sizable term sheet in hand from Lightspeed Ventures, despite his startup not looking to raise at the time. How did that happen? A sticky product experience with the customer feedback and growth to back it up made the startup an investment opportunity Lightspeed’s Nicole Quinn just couldn’t pass up.</p>
<p>A week ago, Novakovski and Quinn joined us on TechCrunch Live to give a breakdown of Lunchclub’s Series A deck and the details on how they connected toward the beginning of the pandemic. Lunchclub is an AI-driven networking tool virtually connecting professionals across multiple industries and levels.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live, formerly known as Extra Crunch Live, takes place every Wednesday at noon PDT/3 p.m. EDT. Each week, audiences get to hear the backstory, best practices and should-haves from founders and the investors who led their round. In the second half, founders in the audience get to live-pitch directly to the guests.</p>
<p>Take a look at some key learnings from our chat with Vlad and Nicole below, and check out the full recording of the episode with the live pitch-off.</p>
<h2>A well placed intro goes a long way</h2>
<p>The impact of your early-stage investors can go a long way. Nicole Quinn discovered Lunchclub through one of the company’s initial investors in the early months of the pandemic in 2020.</p>
<p>“I received an email from an angel investor in Lunchclub, Greg Arrese, saying, ‘Lunchclub just started doing fireside chats,” Nicole recalled. “These fireside chats have really found product-market fit. I mean, we just launched them and they&#8217;ve got thousands of people joining them.’”</p>
<p>Initially connecting with Vlad to participate in a fireside chat and learn more about the company on Wednesday, conversations quickly evolved resulting in a term sheet on Monday, less than a week after meeting.</p>
<p>Introductions to investors from other founders are often touted as the best way to get in front of a VC. In Vlad’s case, it was the investor who made a difference.</p>
<p>“I think as a founder … that speaks to [the] kind of value having a strong … angel investor network when you do your seed or your pre-seed,” Vlad added.</p>
<h2>Consumer feedback is everything</h2>
<p>Founders diligently build products to solve a problem but the true test is with the customers themselves. Novakovski’s Series A deck had customer feedback in the form of social media screenshots but had limited data and case studies — a change he wished he had made before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/creators-brands-collaborate-content/">testing new tools</a> for creators to earn commissions and form partnerships with brands on its platform. The Facebook-owned company is expanding its existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">native affiliate tool</a>, which launched in June and allows creators to discover products, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales driven by their posts.</p>
<p>With this latest launch, creators can now add a digital storefront to showcase products or collections that are already part of their affiliate partnerships within the &#8220;view shop&#8221; button on their profile and earn a commission on sales. Instagram says this new feature is currently only available to creators who are part of its native affiliate program.</p>
<p>Instagram is also testing new branded content partnership features to help creators get discovered by brands. Creators now have the ability to add to their preferred &#8216;brands list&#8217; brands they’re interested in partnering with, which will give them priority when companies are searching for new creators to work with.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, Instagram is rolling out a new folder within DMs exclusively for partnership messages. The new folder aims to ensure that creators don’t miss opportunities from brands whose messages may have otherwise been buried in a creator’s inbox. Partnership messages will skip the requests folder and get priority placement so that brands and creators are able to find and manage their content partnerships.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222550" style="width: 946px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222550" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2222550" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png" alt="" width="936" height="930" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png 936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=768,763 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=680,676 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-brands-creators-feature.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222550" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Brands now also have the option to use data and unique filters to discover suitable creators for their campaigns. They can then also organize shortlists to manage multiple campaigns and creators. Businesses can now also create branded content Reels ads. Further, Instagram has rolled out new account permissions that allow creators to enable brands to create content ads from any of the creator’s posts, stories and Reels.</p>
<p>“These brand-creator partnership tools are a big part of our ongoing commitment to help creators make a living on Instagram — whether they’re partnering with brands, earning money from advertising, getting support from their audience or earning bonuses directly from Instagram,” the company said in a <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/creators-brands-collaborate-content/">blog post.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram notes that it will continue to test and refine these features and make them available for more brands and creators in the future.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Instagram is among several digital platforms working to make it easier for brands and creators to work together. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiktoks-new-creator-marketplace-api-lets-influencer-marketing-companies-tap-into-first-party-data/">TikTok</a> has a Creator Marketplace that helps marketers discover top TikTok personalities for their brand campaigns. Similarly, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-new-ways-for-creators-to-earn-money-and-partner-with-brands-on-pinterest">Pinterest</a> has rolled out features to help creators partner with brands on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of private space stations is officially here as Nanoracks, Voyager Space and Lockheed Martin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nanoracks-lockheed-martin-and-voyager-space-plan-to-launch-crewed-commercial-space-station-by-2027/">announce plans to launch a commercial station in 2027</a>, but it’s just the next logical step for developing the new space economy, the companies say.</p>
<p>“One of our key theses for the industry is that the last 10 years have been defined by building access to space, the next 10 years will be about destinations,” Voyager CEO Dylan Taylor said.</p>
<p>The new space station, dubbed “Starlab” in homage to the third-ever U.S. space station, Skylab, will be composed of an inflatable habitat module, a docking node and a robotic arm. The companies anticipate robust demand from both the public sector and private industry, though Nanoracks CEO Jeffrey Manber emphasized, “the core of Starlab is science.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222562" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Starlab could eventually also host tourists, he added that it’s not a tourism-first project. “Space tourism is what captures the headlines, but to have a sustainable business model, you really do need to move beyond that,” he said.</p>
<p>The trio of companies have submitted Starlab to NASA as a bid under the agency’s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations project, which will allocate up to $400 million in contracts to private companies developing space stations. Any such project will likely require intensive public investment, but Taylor said the funding is just as important as a sign to the world that NASA is interested in maintaining a presence in low Earth orbit, particularly in light of the impending deorbiting of the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Manber echoed his sentiments. “We do not want a space station gap,” he said. “Everybody in the industry, in the community, understands that we cannot have a period where the United States lacks a space station, or space stations, in low Earth orbit.”</p>
<p>Overall, however, private financing will be key, and this is where Voyager comes in. The company, which acquired majority control over Nanoracks this year, will be overseeing financing and allocating capital for the project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Realistically, there is not enough funding from Congress,” Manber said. “Those days have gone. This is a commercial project.”</p>
<p>Many things remain unclear regarding the future of the LEO economy, especially how companies and public agencies plan to balance standardization across design with keeping competitive. Taylor suggested a consortium approach could be one way to create standards for a handful of key technologies. Investment from NASA could also help drive commonality across habitation systems, Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s VP of commercial civil space, said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“NASA as a customer has unleashed this extraordinary revolution in space transportation,” Manber said. “Building on the success that NASA had with cargo, building on the success of commercial crew, one can anticipate that with the markets interested in space, we&#8217;re going to see the same thing with smaller private space stations.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ethereum is the world’s most popular digital contract compiler, maintained by many but owned by none. Perhaps one of the most interesting factors behind its popularization is the future it paints &#8212; one that transforms our current internet standards for ownership, value creation and, most importantly, privacy.</p>
<h2>A transformed future?</h2>
<p>Not only can apps be written on top of Ethereum, but it allows any digital thing &#8212; a picture, a music file, a video, your mom’s favorite pumpkin pie recipe &#8212; to be uniquely owned, traded and stored for value, among many other possibilities that are created daily.</p>
<p>While many have predicted the future of the internet to be layered in bundles and levels of protection, it turns out that, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/world-wide-access-accessible-web-design#:~:text=Accessibility%20Guidelines&amp;text=As%20Tim%20Berners%2DLee%2C%20Director,disability%20is%20an%20essential%20aspect.&amp;text=Building%20web%20content%20that%20is,challenge%20for%20web%20development%20teams.">paraphrasing</a> Tim Berners-Lee, making the underlying technologies accessible to everyone supercharges its adoption and usefulness.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ethereum and the emergence of Web 3.0 paint a shifting picture &#8212; an internet not just private, but open and transparent by default.</p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<p>In 2013, Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">conceived</a> the idea of Ethereum, which would be developed and deployed two years later. The platform was built to allow anyone in the world with access to the internet to write permanent applications (known as decentralized apps or dApps) upon it, which anyone else can interact with but cannot change &#8212; basically open source software with integrity to the nth degree. The bread and butter of these apps are called smart contracts &#8212; a digital contract or intermediary.</p>
<p>Translated, that means financial and legal services no longer require a middleman. Ethereum basically substitutes an escrow agent, a notary, a bank teller who checks your ID, or a mortgage originator for an instant, digital transaction.</p>
<p>This invaluable function makes Ethereum one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies and blockchains in existence, with many contenders trailing. Bitcoin prices recently hit an <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin">all-time high</a>, and the hype surrounding Ethereum remains in full swing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/">Web 3.0</a>, an associated concept, is an imagined future internet that uses these peer-to-peer blockchains to allow users to interact with data, value stores, entities, etc., all without a middleman.</p>
<h2>Ethereum today</h2>
<p>As Ethereum becomes an underlying infrastructure for legal cases, financial deals, binding agreements and more, understanding its weaknesses and strengths will become a fundamental trait of property ownership and transfer.</p>
<p>Updating Stephen Hawking’s <a href="https://twitter.com/codeorg/status/357514287658434560">words</a> on how “basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn,” understanding the fundamentals of smart contracts such as those on Ethereum will become a basic legal and financial skill.</p>
<p>Today, the most booming applications on Ethereum are NFTs &#8212; non-fungible tokens. While NFTs are relatively new, they’re catching on with consumers, artists and investors not only as a store of value but as an assertion of digital, unique ownership.</p>
<p>NFTs allow anything digital (any file) to be owned and traded on the internet because it can’t be manipulated, changed or copied – it’s non-fungible. Any social media hubbub surrounding Apes, Kittys or Punks are all in relation to the burgeoning fan-favorite phenomenon of luxury digital art.</p>
<p>We predict that one use case for this technology will be in interplanetary mining, as companies based on Earth will need to buy and sell mineral rights in asteroids that few if any of their human employees have ever actually visited or seen themselves.</p>
<p>Other predictions for use cases are mortgage lending, property purchasing, event ticketing, music festivals, file storage and gaming &#8212; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon">Axie Infinity</a>, for example, is a testament to how players can make a decent living in an NFT-based gaming world.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless and are being thought up by the curious and energized community more and more every day.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Ethereum of tomorrow</h2>
<p>As regulation catches up to the power of this underlying technology, many wonder if we’ll see attempts to control it. Much like the years-long debate in the <a href="https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/11/14/riana-pfefferkorn-the-looming-battle-in-the-crypto-wars/?slreturn=20210921141037">Crypto Wars</a>, which entailed requests to compromise or break encryption, changes to the assertions of Ethereum’s immutability could compromise its main valuable characteristic: its permanent integrity.</p>
<p>There may be a potential conflict between Ethereum’s immutability and its widespread adoption. It might mean that financial regulators will attempt to take some form of ownership or control over its deployment. We would be curious as to how those potential future regulators would answer the question: How can a widely connected sphere of nodes be cautiously governed while not compromising its true value &#8212; decentralization itself?</p>
<p>Other challenges and limitations the technology is likely to face are performance sustainability &#8212; fees to build on top of Ethereum called gas fees have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/ethereums-scaling-issues-strike-again-as-time-magazines-nfts-sell-for-30-times-their-price/articleshow/86490791.cms">gone up</a> in recent years and the platform is known to be slowing in processing time. Ethereum 2.0 is anticipated to smooth inefficiencies, but how do we continue to maintain speed in a blockchain optimized for storing and computing each and every transaction?</p>
<p>Security also remains a challenge, with known Ethereum vulnerabilities existing though not widely exploited. Poly Network reported a hack this year that resulted from a <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/poly-network-hack/">&#8220;vulnerability between contract calls.” </a></p>
<p>Smart contracts are intricate and complex functions to write, so they require in-depth auditing before being deployed to a network. Ethereum security is also built on passwordless, asymmetric cryptography. It’s entirely possible that quantum computing will eventually disrupt our asymmetric cryptography standards.</p>
<p>We’re interested in how Ethereum and blockchains can be sustained, and we’re HODLing all the way through. Into the metaverse and beyond ….</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s Starship rocket is still in development in southeast Texas, with major progress being made on key elements like the launch tower construction, and installation of the vacuum-rated Raptor engines that will power the vehicle once it reaches space. Elon Musk says that it could be ready to make its first orbital flight attempt next month — provided it gets the regulatory sign-offs it needs.</p>
<p>SpaceX will require approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to make the attempt, as it has for all of its prior test flights of Starship from its development location outside of Brownsville, Texas. The FAA basically requires that SpaceX demonstrate it has taken all necessary safety precautions to ensure that there&#8217;s minimal risk in case of anything going wrong during the launch attempts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If all goes well, Starship will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending regulatory approval</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222531" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1451581465645494279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At this stage of development, that&#8217;s not even a highly unlikely outcome: SpaceX has already seen a number of its Starship prototypes explode (or experience &#8220;rapid, unscheduled disassembly,&#8221; as it&#8217;s often known in the industry) during the development program. Starship testing has also had its successes, however, including completing high-altitude flight tests that are still within Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, and bringing the spacecraft back down for a controlled landing.</p>
<p>The next major milestone for SpaceX is flying a fully stacked version of its Starship and Super Heavy booster combo beyond Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and to outer space. As told by Musk, the company is technically ready for that step, but that regulatory approval could take a lot longer than a month to materialize, if the FAA&#8217;s recent call for public comments on granting a launch license are any indication.</p>
<p>During town hall meetings this past week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738106/spacex-boca-chica-starship-launch-site-faa-town-hall-environmental-assessment">supporters and detractors both got very vocal and raised a number of issues</a> that the FAA will have to review and address along with SpaceX before proceeding to the next step. The FAA could forestall resolving some of these by issuing a temporary license for the purpose of a test and revisiting ongoing launch permissions, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
