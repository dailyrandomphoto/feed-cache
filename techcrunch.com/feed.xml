</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cohort analysis is a way of evaluating your business that involves grouping customers into &#8220;cohorts&#8221; and observing how they behave over time. A commonly used approach is monthly cohort analysis, where customers are grouped by the month they signed up, allowing you to observe how someone who joined in November compares to someone who signed up the month before.</p>
<p>Cohort analysis gives you a multivariable, forward-looking view of your business compared to more simple and static values like averages or totals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cohort analysis is flexible and can be used to analyze a variety of performance metrics including revenue, acquisition costs and churn.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you’re the CMO of the &#8220;Bluetooth Coffee Company.&#8221; You sell a tech-enabled &#8220;coffee composer&#8221; that brews coffee, tracks consumption and orders replacement coffee when users are running low. The longer your customers are subscribers, the more money you make. You recently ran a Black Friday feature on a popular deals site and you’re interested to know if you should run it again.</p>
<p>The chart below is a simple analysis you might do to gauge your marketing performance. It shows the total customers added each month, and a clear spike in November following the Black Friday promotion. At first glance, things look good — you brought in more than double the monthly customers in November compared to October.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197687" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png" alt="Marketing campaign results in significant uptick to users added" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png 2921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=2048,1050 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>But before you rebook the promotion, you should ask if these new Black Friday consumers are as valuable as they seem. Comparing monthly customer percentage is a good way to find out.</p>
<p>Below is a monthly cohort analysis of new customers between September 2020 and February 2021. Like our previous chart, we’ve listed the monthly cohort size, but we’ve also included the customer engagement rate (calculated by dividing daily active users by monthly active users or DAU/MAU for each month (M1 is month 1, M2 is month 2, and so on).</p>
<p>This analysis lets us see how the customer engagement of each monthly cohort compares to the next.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197576" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197576" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197576" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png" alt="Customer engagement by cohort" width="1024" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png 3942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=768,341 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=680,302 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=1536,681 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=2048,908 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-2.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197576" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>From the figures above, we see that most cohorts have a customer engagement rate in their first month (M1, 42%-46%), meaning 42%-46% of new customers use the coffee composer everyday. The November cohort however has materially lower engagement (M1, 30%), and remains lower in subsequent months (M2, 26%) and (M3, 27%). Interestingly, the customer engagement rate only drops with the November cohort, returning to normal with the December cohort (M1, 45%).<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers -- and wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://withshepherd.com/">Shepherd</a>, an insurtech startup focused on the construction market, has closed a $6.15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>. The funding event comes after the startup raised a pre-seed round in February led by <a href="https://www.susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a>, which also participated in Shepherd&#8217;s latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>Thinking broadly, Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers. Insurtech startups serving consumers enjoyed years of venture capital backing only to find their public debuts met with early optimism followed quickly by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">eroding share prices</a>.</p>
<p>But companies like Shepherd &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/">Blueprint Title earlier this week</a> &#8212; are wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. For Shepherd, the construction market is its target, an industry that it intends to carve into starting with excess liability coverage.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Justin Levine, told TechCrunch that contractors in the construction space have a number of insurance requirements, including general liability, commercial auto and so forth. But construction projects often also require more liability coverage, which is sold as excess or umbrella policies.</p>
<p>Targeting the middle-market of the construction space &#8212; companies doing $25 million to $250 million in projects per year, in its view &#8212; Shepherd wants to lean on technology as a way to help underwrite customers.</p>
<p>Levine said that his company&#8217;s offering will have two core parts. The first is what you expected, namely a complete digital experience for customers. The CEO likened its digital offering to table stakes for the insurtech world. We agree. But the company gets more interesting when we consider its second half, namely its work to partner with construction tech providers to help it make underwriting decisions.</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with Procore, for example, a company that invested in its business.</p>
<p>The concept of leaning on third-party software companies to help make underwriting decisions makes some sense &#8212; companies that are more technology-forward in terms of adopting new techniques and methods won&#8217;t have the same underwriting profile as companies that don&#8217;t. Generally, more data makes for better underwriting decisions; linking to the software that helps construction companies function makes good sense from that perspective.</p>
<p>The CEO of Procore agrees, telling TechCrunch that an early customer of his business said that its product is &#8220;a risk management solution disguised as construction management software.&#8221; The more risk that is managed, the lower Shepherd&#8217;s loss ratios may prove over time, allowing it to better compete on price.</p>
<p>On the subject of price, Levine thinks that the construction insurance market is suffering at the moment. Rising settlement costs have led to some legacy insurance books in the space with larger-than-anticipated losses, pushing some providers to raise prices. Levine&#8217;s view is that that Shepherd&#8217;s ability to enter its market without a legacy book of business will help it offer competitive rates.</p>
<p>Excess liability coverage is the &#8220;wedge&#8221; that Shepherd intends to use to get into the construction insurance market, it said, with intention of launching other products in time. The startup is attacking excess liability coverage first, its CEO said, because it&#8217;s the place of maximum pain in the larger construction insurance market.</p>
<p>Frankly, TechCrunch finds the B2B neoinsurance startup market fascinating. Selling policies to consumers has a particular set of cost of goods sold (COGS) &#8212; varying based on the type of coverage, of course &#8212; and often stark go-to-market costs. Furthermore, customer acquisition costs (CACs) can prove irksome when going up against national brands with huge budgets. Perhaps the business insurance market will prove more lucrative for upstart tech companies. Venture investors are certainly willing to place that particular wager.</p>
<p>Natalie Sandman led the deal for Spark, telling TechCrunch that when she first encountered Shepherd it was working on a different project, but that when it shifted its focus, it struck a chord with her firm. The investor said that the idea of bringing new data to the construction insurance underwriting process may help the company make smarter decisions. In the insurance world, better underwriting choices mean more profitable coverage. Which means greater future cash flows. And we all know that that means for value creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> has warned that the Chinese government is using both in-person and digital techniques to intimidate, silence and harass U.S.-based Uyghur Muslims.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Chinese government has long been accused of human rights abuses over its treatment of the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in China&#8217;s Xinjiang region. More than a million Uyghurs have been detained in internment camps, according to a United Nations human rights committee, and many other Uyghurs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">have been targeted and hacked</a> by state-backed cyberattacks. China has repeatedly denied the claims.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese government has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to shut down foreign critics, including those based in the United States and other Western democracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These efforts have now caught the attention of the FBI.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21053780-unclassified-fbi-bulletin-on-prcuyghurs">an unclassified bulletin</a>, the FBI warned that officials are using transnational repression — a term that refers to foreign government transgression of national borders through physical and digital means to intimidate or silence members of diaspora and exile communities — in an attempt to compel compliance from U.S.-based Uyghurs and other Chinese refugees and dissidents, including Tibetans, Falun Gong members, and Taiwan and Hong Kong activists.</p>
<p>“Threatened consequences for non-compliance routinely include detainment of a U.S.-based person’s family or friends in China, seizure of China-based assets, sustained digital and in-person harassment, Chinese government attempts to force repatriation, computer hacking and digital attacks, and false representation online,” the FBI bulletin warns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The bulletin was reported by <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/fbi-uyghurs">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI highlighted four instances of U.S.-based individuals facing harassment. In one case from June, the Chinese government imprisoned dozens of family members of six U.S.-based Uyghur journalists in retaliation for their continued reporting on China and its repression of Uyghurs for the U.S. government-funded news service Radio Free Asia. The bulletin said that between 2019 and March 2021, Chinese officials used WeChat to call and text a U.S.-based Uyghur to discourage her from publicly discussing Uyghur mistreatment. Members of this person’s family were later detained in Xinjiang detention camps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Chinese government continues to conduct this activity, even as the U.S. government has sanctioned Chinese officials and increased public and diplomatic messaging to counter China’s human rights and democratic abuses in Xinjiang over the past year,” the FBI states. “This transnational repression activity violates US laws and individual rights.</p>
<p>The FBI has urged U.S. law enforcement personnel, as well as members of the public, to report any suspected incidents of Chinese government harassment.</p>

<p>The court also took issue with the $5/month payments Locast took from users to ostensibly cover running costs. A judge said Locast was using those funds to expand into more markets and that it was bringing in “far more money from user charges than was necessary.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.botify.com">Botify</a> has raised a $55 million Series C funding round led by InfraVia Growth with Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund also participating. The company has created a search engine optimization (SEO) platform so that your content is better indexed and appears more often in search results.</p>
<p>Existing investors Eurazeo and Ventech are also investing in the startup once again. Nicolas Herschtel from InfraVia and Antoine Izsak from Bpifrance will join the board of directors. Valuation has tripled since the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/botify-series-b/">previous funding round</a>.</p>
<p>While there are a ton of good and bad practices in the SEO industry, Botify defines itself as “white-hat company”. They respect the terms of services of search engines, they don’t scrape search results for insights, they don’t create shady backlinks on other websites.</p>
<p>“We’re going to optimize every step of the search funnel from first the quality of the website, how it is designed, how is the content going to be enriched with, etc.” co-founder and CEO Adrien Menard told me.</p>
<p>There are now three different components in the Botify product suite. The startup first released an analytics tool that gives you insights about your website. Basically, it lets you see how a crawler analyzes your site.</p>
<p>The company then released Botify Intelligence, which hands you a prioritized todo list of things you can do to improve your SEO strategy. And now, the company is also working on automation with Botify Activation. When Google’s search engine bot queries your site, Botify can take over and answer requests directly.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to trick Google’s algorithm. We’re defining Botify as the interface between search engines and our clients’ websites. Search engines are going to access higher quality content. And it’s probably cheaper than with a normal process,” Menard said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies aren’t necessarily using all three tools. They may start with analytics and take it from there. “You can use different products depending on the size of the company,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google has increased the number of ad slots on search results. It also promotes its own services, such as YouTube and Google Maps, before you can see the organic search results. I asked Adrien Menard whether that could be a concern for the future of Botify.</p>
<p>“I agree with you that we’re seeing more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” he said. “But the traffic generated by organic results is growing. It represents 30% of the traffic of the websites of our customers and this average is not decreasing.”</p>
<p>According to him, search keeps getting bigger and bigger. When you invest in search, you can see a clear return on investment when it comes to online sales, traffic, etc.</p>
<p>Right now, Botify has 500 customers, such as Expedia, L’Oréal, The New York Times, Groupon, Marriott, Condé Nast, Crate &amp; Barrel, Fnac Darty, Vestiaire Collective and Farfetch.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to improve its automation capabilities, sign partnerships with more tech companies and increase its footprint with new offices in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, Jeeves was participating in Y Combinator’s summer batch as a fledgling fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, the startup emerged from stealth with $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company, which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global startups, is announcing that it has raised a $57 million Series B at a $500 million valuation. That’s up from a valuation of just north of $100 million at the time of Jeeves’ Series A, which closed in May and was announced in early June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of funding these days is unlike most of us have ever seen before, it’s pretty remarkable that Jeeves essentially signed the term sheet for its Series B just two months after closing on its Series A. It’s also notable that just one year ago, it was wrapping up a YC cohort.</span></p>
<p>Jeeves was not necessarily looking to raise so soon, but fueled by its growth in revenue and spend after its Series A, which was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the company was approached by dozens of potential investors and offered multiple term sheets, according to CEO and co-founder Dileep Thazhmon. Jeeves moved forward with CRV, which had been interested since the A and built a relationship with Thazhmon, so it could further accelerate growth and launch in more countries, he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV led the Series B round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent, Silicon Valley Bank, Alkeon Capital Management, Soros Fund Management and a high-profile group of angel investors including NBA stars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, Odell Beckham Jr. and The Chainsmokers. Notably, the founders of a dozen unicorn companies also put money in the Series B including (but not limited to) Clip CEO Adolfo Babatz; QuintoAndar CEO Gabriel Braga; Uala CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince; Mercury CEO Immad Akhund; Bitso founder Pablo Gonzalez; Monzo Bank’s Tom Blomfield; Intercom founder Des Traynor; Lithic CEO Bo Jiang as well as founders from UiPath, Auth0, GoCardless, Nubank, Rappi, Kavak and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeeves emerges from stealth with $131M in debt and equity and a16z as a lead investor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/embed/#?secret=wiS3qDmIIK" data-secret="wiS3qDmIIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering was live in Mexico and Canada and today launched in Colombia, the United Kingdom and Europe as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country — a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proprietary Banking-as-a-Service infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card (with 4% cash back), non card payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a growing business can use a Jeeves card in Barcelona and pay it back in euros and use the same card in Mexico and pay it back in pesos, reducing any FX fees and providing instant spend reconciliation across currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon believes that the “biggest thing” the company is building out is its own global BaaS layer, that sits across different banking entities in each country, and onto which the end user customer-facing Jeeves app plugs into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, he said, “think of it as a BaaS platform, but with only one app &#8212; the Jeeves app &#8212; plugged into it.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197614" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197614" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2197614 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jeeves</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by more than 5,000% since January, and both revenue and spend volume has increased more than 1,100% (11x) since its Series A earlier this year, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves now covers more than 12 currencies and 10 countries across three continents. Mexico is its largest market. Jeeves is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile and Thazhmon expects that by year’s end, it will be live in all of North America and Europe. Next year, it’s eyeing the Asian market, and Tencent should be able to help with that strategically, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets — cash, corporate cards, cross-border — all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our model is very similar to that of Uber’s launch model where we can launch very quickly because we don&#8217;t have to rebuild an entire infrastructure. When we launch in countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we actually don&#8217;t have to rebuild a stack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves’ user base has been doubling every 60 days and now powers more than 1,000 companies across LatAm, Canada and Europe, including Bitso, Kavak, RappiPay, Belvo, Runa, Moons, Convictional, Muncher, Juniper, Trienta, Platzi, Worky and others, according to Thazhmon. The company says it has a current waitlist of over 15,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves plans to use its new capital toward its launch in Colombia, the U.K. and Europe. And, of course, toward more hiring. It’s already doubled its number of employees to 55 over the past month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former a16z partner Matt Hafemeister was so impressed with what Jeeves is building that in August he left the venture capital firm to join the startup as its head of growth. In working with the founders as an investor, he concluded that they ranked “among the best founders in fintech” he’d ever interacted with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to leave a16z also related to Jeeves’ inflection point, Hafemeister said. The startup is nearly doubling every month, and had already eclipsed year-end goals on revenue by mid-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident Jeeves has found early product market fit and, given the speed of execution, I see Jeeves establishing itself as one of the most important fintech companies in the next few years,” H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">afemeister</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The company is transitioning from a seed company to a Series B company very quickly, and being able to help operationalize processes and play a role in their growth and maturity is an incredible opportunity for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jeeves is building products and infrastructure that are very difficult to execute but by doing the ‘hard things’ they offer incredible value to their customers,” he told TechCrunch. “We haven&#8217;t seen anyone build from the ground up with global operations in mind on day one.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As one of the frontrunners in the race to build the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/">metaverse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/roblox/">Roblox</a> is thinking ahead to what virtual worlds really need. And while the platform has had no shortage of growth on its current path — as of July, it boasted 47 million daily active users — it’s looking to chart a course toward deeper, richer virtual experiences that will keep people coming back for years to come.</p>
<p>To that end, Roblox is taking <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/">careful but decisive steps</a> toward weaving voice chat into the platform’s core experience. The first move: inviting a group of trusted developers to explore how they can integrate proximity-based audio into the wildly popular experiences that beat at the heart of the platform — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tloFO_brF5Y">chill, vaporwavey vibe games</a> to pulling off kickflips in a <a href="https://www.roblox.com/vans">Vans-sponsored skate park</a>.</p>
<p>With spatial audio, users will be able to speak with other people nearby through live voice chat. Roblox sees its new voice product as a natural extension of the way that text chat works now, but instead of text bubbles that pop up over an avatar’s head, visible to anybody around them, players will be able to talk naturally to the other people they bump into.</p>
<p>Say you’re hanging out in a virtual skatepark in Roblox with spatial audio enabled: skaters in the half pipe with you would sound loud and clear, just like they would in real life. But you wouldn’t be able to hear someone walking around on the sidewalk across the street, since they’re too far away. To have a private conversation with a nearby friend, you might peel off and walk toward a store down the block.</p>
<p>“As we think about the future of communication in the metaverse, we think that it needs to be very natural and feel very similar to the way we communicate in the real world,” Roblox Chief Product Officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch in an interview. “But it also can transcend, some of the limitations that physics and space create in the real world.”</p>
<p>Bronstein joined the company in March, leaving Google to help realize Roblox’s particular vision for the metaverse. Prior to hopping over to Roblox, Bronstein worked on product teams at Zynga, Xbox and YouTube — three very different companies that are probably equal parts relevant to his current work.</p>
<p>“If you think about the the metaverse as the next incarnation of where you know I could go shopping or I could go to a concert, I could go to school, I think that you need to be relevant to everybody in society and you need to both build the content, the rules, the features that support all of those behaviors,&#8221; Bronstein said. &#8220;And part of bringing voice to the platform is to ensure that our older audiences has a natural way to communicate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voice chat is very much on the way to Roblox, but that doesn’t mean it will appear overnight — and that’s by design. The company is inviting an initial group of 5,000 developers, all 13 and older, to try out the new spatial voice chat capabilities in a custom-built Roblox community space.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve put a bunch of neat features in there and places for them to chat and hang out and they’re going to be able to learn from the code that we wrote for that community space… So a few weeks later or a month later they can put that into their experiences and turn it on,” Bronstein said.</p>
<p>Bronstein emphasizes that Roblox will take this process slowly, building new moderation and safety tools in parallel as it goes. The voice rollout will go slowly, starting with the chosen circle of developers and gradually expanding out from there as the company feels confident that it can create a safe enough environment with its moderation tools.</p>
<p>“I think we want to take it slowly and we want to learn as we go through it,” Bronstein said. “We may start, as I mentioned, with the developers. It is likely that right after that, we may go to an audience that is 13+ and park there for a while until we understand exactly if all the pieces are falling into place before deciding if we ever open it to a younger audience.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Roblox final fantasy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/embed/#?secret=7DTnDje3Fy" data-secret="7DTnDje3Fy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To moderate its sprawl of virtual worlds, Roblox uses a blend of automated scanning and a 3,000-person safety team of human reviewers. Like in any social network, players can report, block and mute other players to make their own experiences feel more comfortable. And because half of its player base is under 13, Roblox gives parents options on what kinds of age-appropriate experiences to allow and toggles for things like text chat. If voice chat ever makes its way to younger age groups, parents would be able to disable it altogether.</p>
<p>Roblox’s under-13 crowd comprises a massive chunk of its user base, but a surprising number of older kids and young adults hang out there too. According to the company, 50 percent of its users are over the age of 13 and it’s seeing the most explosive user growth among 17 to 24-year-olds. Roblox is attracting new users, but its core users are also growing up and the company knows it needs to grow alongside them.</p>
<p>Whether voice chat ever rolls out for younger users or not, Roblox seems well aware that keeping a virtual environment with voice chat feeling safe and friendly is a steep challenge. The company plans to rely on user-initiated reporting as voice rolls out and it’s exploring other tools that could bolster those efforts. The company is looking at a few different tools, including automatically recording a snippet of conversation just prior to a user being reported as a way to capture bad behavior for reviewers. It&#8217;s also interested in expanding reputation systems that automatically restrict users who have a certain number of strikes against them.</p>
<p>Much like any social platform, Roblox will likely lean heavily on user reporting, which disproportionately shifts the burden to users on the receiving end of hate and harassment — an unfortunate outcome that no social company has properly dedicated the human resources to solving.</p>

<h3>Next on the voice roadmap</h3>
<p>Bronstein describes spatial audio as “one component” of Roblox’s vision for natural communication. The next step is integrating a voice chat experience that’s persistent across experiences, letting users who know each other hang out even when they aren’t doing the same thing. For anyone who paid attention to the company’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"> quiet acquisition of a company called Guilded</a> last month, that won’t come as a surprise. Though Roblox’s work on voice pre-dates the acquisition, Guilded will lay the groundwork for Roblox’s future voice plans</p>
<p>A Discord competitor, Guilded similarly built out a chat platform for gamers, doubling down on the competitive gaming scene where Discord expanded its horizons beyond gaming. Beyond group voice chat, Guilded gives gamers built-in scheduling and community management tools that ease the hassle of organizing complex online social events, like wrangling twenty some odd gamers to run raids in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>“In the near term, Guilded has an amazing road map, we want to just continue with that road map and grow it without any hardcore integration at this point,” Bronstein said.</p>

<h3>Into the metaverse</h3>
<p>Moderation challenges aside, there&#8217;s basically nothing in Roblox&#8217;s way. The company went public in March and today it&#8217;s worth 49 billion, making it easily one of the most valuable companies in gaming. Investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">content creators</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/"> tech giants</a> alike are going all-in on the metaverse, and really, it looks like a pretty safe bet.</p>
<p>Metaverse is a buzzy term right now, but it&#8217;s more shorthand than empty hype. When people talk about the metaverse, they generally want to evoke a futuristic vision of interconnected virtual worlds — online spaces that we can move through, socialize and shop within (for better or worse, that last part is key). Whether this will all be in virtual reality or not and when is a point of some debate, but really the <em>interconnected</em> part is the bigger challenge. In the app age, software was siloed by design. But to realize the promise of the metaverse, our virtual selves and our virtual stuff will need to be able to move through online worlds fluidly.</p>
<p>A few companies are ahead of the curve on this, and it&#8217;s no coincidence that two of the big ones, Roblox and Fortnite-maker Epic — best known for their virtual worlds stocked with custom avatars, in-game economies and a seamless social layer — are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">elevating user-created content</a>. Those experiences, and the ability to easily hang out with friends while doing stuff in them and elsewhere in virtual space, may wind up being what the metaverse is all about.</p>
<p>Most adults can hardly grasp the appeal of the blocky, suburban worlds that their kids love hanging out in, but Roblox understands something fundamental about where online life is <em>going</em>. Or rather where we&#8217;ll all going — into online worlds like Roblox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after celebrating its first manned launch to orbit – which is now under investigation with the Federal Aviation Administration – Virgin Galactic wants to return to space.</p>
<p>The company will be conducting its first commercial mission, the 23<sup>rd</sup> for the VSS Unity rocket-powered spaceplane, in late September or early October from the company’s sprawling Spaceport America facility. The flight will carry three crew members from the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council, each of whom paid an undisclosed amount for the seat. A Virgin Galactic staff member will also be on board.</p>
<p>The role of mission lead will be held by Walter Villadei, a Colonel with the Italian Air Force; Angelo Landolfi, a physician and Lieutenant Colonel; Pantaleone Carlucci, an aerospace engineer on behalf of the National Research Council; and Virgin Galactic’s chief astronaut instructor Beth Moses. Michael Masucci and CJ Sturckow will pilot the spaceplane.</p>
<p>The goal of the mission will be to evaluate the effects of the “transitional phase” from gravity to zero G on the human body; to that end, the crew members will be wearing sensors to measure physiological activity, and Villadei will even be wearing a smart suit that Virgin says will “[incorporate] Italian fashion style and technology.”</p>
<p>The announcement comes just one day after the FAA said that it was investigating the first crewed flight of VSS Unity in July. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a> and confirmed by the aerospace regulatory, who said that the spaceplane “deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.” According to journalist Nicholas Schmidle’s reporting, a red warning light appeared on the dash of the Unity during flight, indicating that it had diverged from its planned trajectory.</p>

<p>Virgin Galactic later issued a statement disputing the piece, saying that “athough the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory,” the company added.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Schmidle has uncovered news regarding the safety of Virgin Galactic’s supersonic operations. His book, Test Gods, also includes a previously unknown account of a 2019 test flight (confirmed in the book by former employees) which saw potentially serious issues with the plane’s wing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe&#8217;s top court has dealt another blow to &#8216;zero rating&#8217; &#8212; ruling for a second time that the controversial carrier practice goes against the European Union&#8217;s rules on open Internet access.</p>
<p>&#8216;Zero rating&#8217; refers to commercial offers that can be made by mobile network operators to entice customers by excluding the data consumption of certain (often popular) apps from a user&#8217;s tariff.</p>
<p>The practice is controversial because it goes against the &#8216;level playing field&#8217; principle of the open Internet (aka &#8216;net neutrality&#8217;).</p>
<p>EU legislators passed the bloc&#8217;s first set of open Internet/net neutrality rules <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/ep-telecoms-vote/">back in 2015</a> &#8212; with the law coming into application in 2016 &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/here-are-the-meps-you-should-tweet-about-net-neutrality-this-morning/">critics warned</a> at the time over vague provisions in the regulation which they suggested could be used by carriers to undermine the core fairness principle of treating all Internet traffic the same.</p>
<p>Some regional telcos have continued to put out zero rating offers &#8212; which has led to a number of challenges to test the robustness of the law. But the viability of zero rating within the EU must now be in doubt given the double slap-down by the CJEU.</p>
<p>In its first major decision <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/europes-top-court-says-net-neutrality-rules-bar-zero-rating/">last year</a> &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">relating to a challenge against Telenor in Hungary &#8212; the court found that commercial use of zero rating was liable to limit the exercise of end users’ rights within the meaning of the regulation.</span></p>
<p>Its ruling today &#8212; which relates to a challenge against zero rating by Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland in Germany (this time with a roaming component) &#8212; comes to what looks like an even clearer conclusion, with the court giving the practice very short shrift indeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By today’s judgments, the Court of Justice notes that a ‘zero tariff’ option, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, draws a distinction within internet traffic, on the basis of commercial considerations, by not counting towards the basic package traffic to partner applications. Such a commercial practice is contrary to the general obligation of equal treatment of traffic, without discrimination or interference, as required by the regulation on open internet access,&#8221; it writes in a (notably brief) press release summarizing the judgement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since those limitations on bandwidth, tethering or on use when roaming apply only on account of the activation of the ‘zero tariff’ option, which is contrary to the regulation on open internet access, they are also incompatible with EU law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland for comment on the ruling.</p>
<p>In a statement welcoming the CJEU&#8217;s decision, the European consumer protection association BEUC&#8217;s senior digital policy officer, Maryant Fernández Pérez, subbed the ruling &#8220;very positive news for consumers and those who want the internet to stay open to all&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies like Vodafone use these ‘zero tariff’ rates, they essentially lock-in consumers and limit what the Internet can offer to them. Zero-rating is detrimental to consumer choice, competition, innovation, media diversity and freedom of information,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Kathryn Zealand shared some insight on the eve of Women’s Equality Day. The post highlighted an issue that&#8217;s been apparent to everyone in and around the robotics industry: there’s a massive gender gap. It’s something we try to be mindful of, particularly when programming events like TC Sessions: Robotics. Zealand cites some pretty staggering figures in the piece.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zippia.com/robotics-engineer-jobs/demographics/">According to the stats</a>, around 9% of robotics engineers are female. That’s bad. That’s, like, bad even by the standards of STEM fields in general &#8212; which is to say, it’s really, really bad. (The ethnic disparities in the same source are worth drawing attention to, as well.)</p>
<p>Zealand’s piece was published on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/robotics-future-lets-make-sure-its-built-everyone-kathryn-zealand/">LinkedIn</a> &#8212; fitting, given that the overarching focus here is on hiring. Well worth your time, if you&#8217;re involved in the hiring process at a robotics firm and are concerned about broader diversity issues (which hopefully go hand in hand for most orgs). Zealand offers some outside of the box thinking in terms of what, precisely, it means to be a roboticist, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a huge opportunity here! Women and other under-represented groups are untapped pools of talented people who, despite not thinking of themselves as “roboticists,” could be vital members of a world-changing robotics team.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to be real with you for a minute, and note what really caught my eye was that above image. See, Zealand is a Project Lead at Alphabet X. And what you have there is a robotic brace &#8212; or, rather, what appears to be a component of a soft exosuit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2191371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Exosuits/exoskeletons are a booming category for robotics right now that really run the gamut from Sarcos’ giant James Cameron-esque suit to far subtler, fabric-based systems. Some key names in the space include Ekso Bionics, ReWalk and SuitX. Heck, even Samsung has shown off a solution as part of a robotics department that appears to be largely ornamental at the moment.</p>

<p>Most of these systems aim to tackle one of two issues: 1) Augmenting workers to assist with difficult or repetitive tasks for work and 2) Provide assistance to those with impaired mobility. Many companies have offers for both. Here’s what Harvard’s <a href="https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/soft-exosuits">Biodesign Lab</a> has to say on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer&#8217;s joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light. These properties minimize the suit&#8217;s unintentional interference with the body&#8217;s natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alphabet loves to give the occasional behind-the-scenes peak at some of its X projects, and it turns out we’ve had a couple of glimpses of the Smarty Pants project. Zealand and Smarty Pants make a cameo in a Wired UK piece that ran early last year about the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Google/Alphabet X. The piece notes that that the project was inspired by her experience with her 92-year-old grandmother’s mobility issues.</p>

<p>The piece highlights a very early Raspberry Pi-controlled setup created by a team that includes costume designers and deep learning specialists (getting back to that earlier discussion about outside the box thinking when it comes to what constitutes a roboticist). The system is using sensors in an attempt to effectively predict movement in order to anticipate where force needs to be applied for tasks like walking up stairs. The piece ends on a fittingly somber note, “Fewer than half of X’s investigations become Projects. By the time this story is published it will probably have been killed.”</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the team is looking to differentiate itself from other exosuit projects by leveraging Google&#8217;s knowledge base of deep learning and AI to build out those predictive algorithms.</p>
<p>Alphabet declined to offer additional information on the project, noting that it likes to give its moonshot teams, &#8220;time to learn and iterate out of the spotlight.” But last October, we got what is probably our best look at Smarty Pants, in the form of a video highlighting Design Kitchen, Alphabet X’s lab/design studio.</p>

<p>The Wired piece mentions a “pearlescent bumbag,” holding the aforementioned Raspberry Pi and additional components. For you yanks, that’s a fanny pack, which are not referred to as such in the U.K., owing to certain regional slang. Said fanny pack also makes an appearance in the video, providing, honestly, a very clever solution to the issue of hanging wires for an early-stage wearable prototype.</p>
<p>“One of the things that’s really helped the team is being really focused on a problem. Even if you spent months on something, if it’s not actually going to achieve that goal, then sometimes you honor the work that’s been done and say, ‘we’ve learned a ton of things during the process, but this is not the one that’s actually going to solve that problem.’ ”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbDQtxPxg08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The most notable takeaway from the video is some additional footage of prototypes. One imagines that, by the time Alphabet feels confident sharing that sort of stuff with the world, the team has moved well beyond it. “It doesn’t matter how janky and cardboard-and-duct-tape it is, as long as it helps you learn — and everyone can prototype, even while working from home,” the X team writes in an associated blog post.</p>
<p>The one other bit of information we have at the moment is<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d6/7d/48/38c3bcd8a1a8d7/US20210084997A1.pdf"> a granted patent application from last year</a>, which comes with all of the standard patent warnings. Seeing a patent come to fruition is often even more of a longshot (read: moonshot) than betting on an Alphabet X project to graduate. But they can offer some insight into where a team is headed &#8212; or at least some of the avenues it has considered.</p>

<p>The patent highlights similar attempts to anticipate movement as those highlighted above. It effectively uses sensors and machine learning to adjust the tension on regions of the garments designed to assist the wearer.</p>

<p>The proposed methods and systems provide adaptive support and assistance to users by performing intelligent dynamic adjustment of tension and stiffness in specific areas of fabric or by applying forces to non-stretch elements within a garment that is comfortable enough to be suitable for frequent, everyday usage. The methods include detecting movement of a particular part of a user&#8217;s body enclosed within the garment, determining an activity classification for that movement, identifying a support configuration for the garment tailored to the activity classification, and dynamically adjusting a tension and/or a stiffness of one or more controllable regions of the garment or applying force to non-stretch fabric elements in the garment to provide customized support and assistance for the user and the activity the user is performing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice seeing Alphabet take a more organic approach to developing robotics startups in-house, rather than the acquisitions and consolidations that occurred several years back that ultimately found Boston Dynamics briefly living under the Google umbrella. Of course, we saw the recent graduation of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/">Wendy Tan White-led Intrinsic</a>, which builds software for industrial robotics.</p>
<p>All right, so there’s a whole bunch of words about a project we know next to nothing about! Gotta love the startup space, where we’re definitely not spinning wild speculation based on a thin trail of breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>I will say for sure that I definitely know more about Agility Robotics than I did this time last week, after speaking with the Oregon-based company’s CEO and CTO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/agility-robotics-digit-gets-a-warehouse-gig/">The conversation</a> was ostensibly about a new video the team released showcasing Digit doing some menial tasks in a warehouse/fulfillment setting.</p>
<p>Some key things I learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agility sold a dozen Cassie robots, largely to researchers.</li>
<li>It’s already sold “substantially more” Digits.</li>
<li>The team includes 56 people, primarily in Oregon (makes sense, as an OSU spinout), with plans to expand operations into Pittsburgh, everyone’s favorite rustbelt robotics hub.</li>
<li>Agility is consulting with “major logistics companies.”</li>
<li>In addition to the Ford delivery deal, the company has its sights set on warehouse tasks in hopes of offering a more adaptable solution than ground-up warehouse automation companies like Berkshire Gray.</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, and a good quote about job loss from CEO Damion Shelton:</p>
<blockquote><p>The conversation around automation has shifted a bit. It’s viewed as an enabling technology to allow you to keep the workforce that you have. There are a lot of conversations around the risks of automation and job loss, but the job loss is actually occurring now, in advance of the automated solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agility hopes to start rolling out its robots to locations in the next year. More immediate than that, however, is this deal between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/simbes-robots-will-be-deployed-across-midwestern-grocery-chain-schnucks/">Simbe Robotics and midwestern grocery chain, Schnuks</a>. The food giant will be bringing Simbe’s inventor robots to all of its 111 stores, four years after it began piloting the tech.</p>

<p>Segway&#8217;s first robotic lawnmower is designed for a lawn area of up to 3,000 square meters, has several features of a smart helper in the garden and is the quietest mower on the market with only 54 dB. The Frequent Soft Cut System (FSCS) ensures that the lawn is cut from above and the desired height is reached gradually. Offset blades allow cutting as close as possible to edges and corners.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to hand over detailed Autopilot data by October 22nd or else face fines of up to $115 million, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Back in August, NHTSA announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">investigating</a> incidents wherein Tesla vehicles with Autopilot activated crashed into parked first responder vehicles with flashing lights. The agency originally cited 11 such crashes, which resulted in 17 injuries and one death since 2018, but a 12th incident occurred just this Saturday.</p>
<p>In a letter it sent the automaker, the NHTSA told Tesla to produce detailed information on how the driver assistance system works. It wants to know how it ensures that human drivers will keep their eyes on the road while Autopilot is engaged and whether there are limits on where it can be used. Feds have long criticized Tesla for not having the safeguards to make sure human drivers are keeping their hands on the wheel. A few months ago, the company finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-in-car-camera-autopilot-081511875.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">activated</a> the camera mounted above the rear view mirror in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to &#8220;detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged.&#8221; In addition, Autopilot is only meant for use on highways, but there&#8217;s nothing keeping drivers from using it on local roads.</p>
<p>In addition to detailed Autopilot data, the NHTSA is also asking for information on how many cars Tesla has sold in the US. It wants to know every Autopilot-related arbitration proceeding or lawsuit the company has been involved in, along with all the complaints Tesla has received about the driver assistance technology from customers.</p>

Back then, the company expected to debut the car sometime last year. 2020 came and went without Tesla sharing much information on the supercar.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.panoramaed.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built out a K-12 education software platform, has raised $60 million in a Series C round of funding led by General Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Owl Ventures, Emerson Collective, Uncork Capital, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Tao Capital Partners also participated in the financing, which brings the Boston-based company’s total raised since its 2012 inception to $105 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama declined to reveal at what valuation the Series C was raised, nor did it provide any specific financial growth metrics. CEO and co-founder Aaron Feuer did say the company now serves 13 million students in 23,000 schools across the United States, which means that 25% of American students are enrolled in a district served by Panorama today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 of the largest 100 school districts and state agencies in the country use its platform. In total, more than 1,500 school districts are among its customers. Clients include the New York City Department of Education, Clark County School District in Nevada, Dallas ISD in Texas and the Hawaii Department of Education, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since March 2020, Panorama has added 700 school districts to its customer base, nearly doubling the 800 it served just 18 months prior, according to Feuer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what does Panorama do exactly? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the SaaS business surveys students, parents and teachers to collect actionable data. Former Yale graduate students Feuer and Xan Tanner started the company in an effort to figure out the best way for schools to collect and understand feedback from their students.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Panorama Raises $12 Million To Help Schools Understand Their Students&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/panorama-raises-12-million-to-help-schools-understand-their-students/embed/#?secret=zk1a4GvtEq" data-secret="zk1a4GvtEq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to many students attending school virtually, the need to address students’ social and emotional needs has probably never been more paramount. Many children and teenagers have suffered depression and anxiety due to being isolated from their peers, and some believe the impact on their mental health has been even greater than any negative academic repercussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, for example, are asked questions to determine how safe they feel at school, how much they trust their teachers and how much potential they think they have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help schools survey students, teachers and parents to understand the environment and experiences of the school,” Feuer told TechCrunch. “And then we help schools measure social and emotional development so that in the same way you might have rigorous data on math, you can now get information about social emotional learning and well-being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, for example, 25 million people across the country have taken a Panorama survey, which has resulted in quite a bit of information. The company is able to integrate with all of a district’s existing data systems so that it can pull together a “panorama” of its data, plus the information about a student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really powerful because a teacher can then log in and see everything about a student in one place,” Feuer said. “But most importantly, we give teachers the tools to plan actions for a student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, districts can see benefits such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved graduation rates, fewer behavior referrals, more time engaged in learning and students building “stronger supportive relationships with adults and peers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama plans to use its new capital toward continued product development, further deepening its district partnerships and naturally, toward hiring. Panorama currently has about 250 employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Panorama had not raised capital in a couple of years simply because, according to Feuer, it did not need the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We met General Atlantic and realized the opportunity to reach the next level of impact for our schools,” he told TechCrunch. “But it was important to me that we didn’t need to raise the money. We chose to because we want to be able to invest in the business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanzeen Syed, managing director at General Atlantic, said edtech has been an important area of focus for this firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looked at the U.S. education system, we thought that there was a massive opportunity and that we&#8217;re in the very early innings of using software and technology to really enhance the student experience,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to Panorama, he believes “it’s not just a business” for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They truly and deeply care about providing students and administrators with the tools to make the student experience better,” Syed told TechCrunch. “And they&#8217;re maniacally focused on developing the sort of product to allow them to do that. In addition to that, we spoke with a lot of schools and districts and the feedback came back consistently positive.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the past 18 months is any indication, the nature of the workplace is changing. And while Box and Zoom already have integrations together, it makes sense for them to continue to work more closely.</p>
<p>Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.</p>
<p>While in Zoom, users can securely and directly access Box to browse, preview and share files from Zoom — even if they are not taking part in an active meeting. This new feature follows a Zoom integration Box launched last year with its “Recommended Apps” section that enables access to Zoom from Box so that workflows aren’t disrupted.</p>
<p>The companies’ chief product officers, Diego Dugatkin with Box and Oded Gal with Zoom, discussed with TechCrunch why seamless partnerships like these are a solution for the changing workplace.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/">The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/embed/#?secret=sKjtHwnfzQ" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With digitization happening everywhere, an integration of “best-in-breed” products for collaboration is essential, Dugatkin said. Not only that, people don’t want to be moving from app to app, instead wanting to stay in one environment.</p>
<p>“It’s access to content while never having to leave the Zoom platform,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also access to content and contacts in different situations. When everyone was in an office, meeting at a moment’s notice internally was not a challenge. Now, more people are understanding the value of flexibility, and both Gal and Dugatkin expect that spending some time at home and some time in the office will not change anytime soon.</p>
<p>As a result, across the spectrum of a company, there is an increasing need for allowing and even empowering people to work from anywhere, Dugatkin said. That then leads to a conversation about sharing documents in a secure way for companies, which this collaboration enables.</p>
<p>The new Box and Zoom integration enables meeting in a hybrid workplace: chat, video, audio, computers or mobile devices, and also being able to access content from all of those methods, Gal said.</p>
<p>“Companies need to be dynamic as people make the decision of how they want to work,” he added. “The digital world is providing that flexibility.”</p>
<p>This long-term partnership is just scratching the surface of the continuous improvement the companies have planned, Dugatkin said.</p>
<p>Dugatkin and Gal expect to continue offering seamless integration before, during and after meetings: utilizing Box’s cloud storage, while also offering the ability for offline communication between people so that they can keep the workflow going.</p>
<p>“As Diego said about digitization, we are seeing continuous collaboration enhanced with the communication aspect of meetings day in and day out,” Gal added. “Being able to connect between asynchronous and synchronous with Zoom is addressing the future of work and how it is shaping where we go in the future.”</p>

<p>In a group of nearly 400 startups, you might think it&#8217;d be hard to find a category that felt overrepresented, but we’ve managed.</p>
<p>To start, we were surprised by the sheer number of startups in the cohort that were pursuing software models that incorporated no-code and low-code techniques. We expected some, surely, but not the nearly 20 that we compiled this morning.</p>
<p>Startups in the YC batch are building no-code and low-code tools to help developers build faster internal workflows (<a href="https://www.tantl.com/">Tantl</a>), build branded real estate portals (<a href="https://noloco.io">Noloco</a>), sync data between other no-code tools (<a href="https://www.whalesync.com">Whalesync</a>), automate HR (<a href="https://zazos.com/en">Zazos</a>), and more. Also in the mix were <a href="https://hello.brightreps.com/">BrightReps</a>, <a href="https://beau.to">Beau</a>, <a href="https://getalchemy.app/">Alchemy</a>, <a href="https://hyperseed.com">Hyperseed</a>, <a href="https://enso.org">Enso</a>, <a href="https://www.hitpayapp.com/">HitPay</a>, <a href="https://whaly.io/">Whaly</a>, <a href="https://www.muse.place/">Muse</a>, Abstra, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/">Lago</a>, <a href="https://www.inai.io/">Inai</a> and <a href="http://www.breadcrumbs.io/">Breadcrumbs.io</a>.</p>
<p>At least 18 companies in the group name-dropped no- and low-code in their pitches. They are taking on a host of industries, from finance and real estate to sales and HR. In short, no- and low-code tools are cropping up in what feels like every sector. It appears that the startup world has decided that helping non-developers build their own tools, workflows and apps is a trend here to stay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://explosion.ai/">Explosion</a>, a company that has combined an open source machine learning library with a set of commercial developer tools, announced a $6 million Series A today on a $120 million valuation. The round was led by SignalFire, and the company reported that today&#8217;s investment represents 5% of its value.</p>
<p>Oana Olteanu from SignalFire will be joining the board under the terms of the deal, which includes warrants of $12 million in additional investment at the same price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, Explosion is a software company and we build developer tools for AI and machine learning and natural language processing. So our goal is to make developers more productive and more focused on their natural language processing, so basically understanding large volumes of text, and training machine learning models to help with that and automate some processes,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Ines Montani told me.</p>
<p>The company started in 2016 when Montani met her co-founder, Matthew Honnibal in Berlin where he was working on the <a href="http://spaCy.io">spaCy</a> open source machine learning library. Since then, that open source project has been downloaded over 40 million times.</p>
<p>In 2017, they added <a href="https://prodi.gy/">Prodigy</a>, a commercial product for generating data for the machine learning model. &#8220;Machine learning is code plus data, so to really get the most out of the technologies you almost always want to train your models and build custom systems because what&#8217;s really most valuable are problems that are super specific to you and your business and what you&#8217;re trying to find out, and so we saw that the area of creating training data, training these machine learning models, was something that people didn&#8217;t pay very much attention to at all,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The next step is a product called Prodigy Teams, which is a big reason the company is taking on this investment. &#8220;Prodigy Teams  is [a hosted service that] adds user management and collaboration features to Prodigy, and you can run it in the cloud without compromising on what people love most about Prodigy, which is the data privacy, so no data ever needs to get seen by our servers,&#8221; she said. They do this by letting the data sit on the customer&#8217;s private cluster in a private cloud, and then use Prodigy Team&#8217;s management features in the public cloud service.</p>
<p>Today, they have 500 companies using Prodigy including Microsoft and Bayer in addition to the huge community of millions of open source users. They&#8217;ve built all this with just 6 early employees, a number that has grown to 17 recently and they hope to reach 20 by year&#8217;s end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes if you&#8217;re thinking too much about diversity in your hiring process, you probably have a problem already. &#8220;If you go into hiring and you&#8217;re thinking like, oh, how can I make sure that the way I&#8217;m hiring is diverse, I think that already shows that there&#8217;s maybe a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a company, and it&#8217;s 50 dudes in their 20s, it&#8217;s not surprising that you might have problems attracting people who are not white dudes in their 20s. But in our case, our strategy is to hire good people and good people are often very diverse people, and again if you play by the [startup] playbook, you could be limited in a lot of other ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that they have never seen themselves as a traditional startup following some conventional playbook. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t raise any investment money [until now]. We grew the team organically, and we focused on being profitable and independent [before we got outside investment],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But more than the money, Montani says that they needed to find an investor that would understand and support the open source side of the business, even while they got capital to expand all parts of the company. &#8220;Open source is a community of users, customers and employees. They are real people, and [they are not] pawns in [some] startup game, and it&#8217;s not a game. It&#8217;s real, and these are real people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve more than just my eyeballs and grand promises. [&#8230;] And so it&#8217;s very important that even if we&#8217;re selling a small stake in our company for some capital [to build our next] product [that open source remains at] the core of our company and that&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t want to compromise on,&#8221; Montani said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission has unanimously voted to ban the spyware maker SpyFone and its chief executive Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance industry, the first order of its kind, after the agency accused the company of harvesting mobile data on thousands of people and leaving it on the open internet.</p>
<p>The agency said SpyFone &#8220;secretly harvested and shared data on people’s physical movements, phone use and online activities through a hidden device hack,&#8221; allowing the spyware purchaser to &#8220;see the device’s live location and view the device user’s emails and video chats.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpyFone is one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">many so-called &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; apps</a> that are marketed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/stalkerware-apps-google-ads/">under the guise of parental control</a> but are often used by spouses to spy on their partners. The spyware works by being surreptitiously installed on someone&#8217;s phone, often without their permission, to steal their messages, photos, web browsing history and real-time location data. The FTC also charged that the spyware maker exposed victims to additional security risks because the spyware runs at the &#8220;root&#8221; level of the phone, which allows the spyware to access off-limits parts of the device&#8217;s operating system. A premium version of the app included a keylogger and &#8220;live screen viewing,&#8221; the FTC says.</p>
<p>But the FTC said that SpyFone&#8217;s &#8220;lack of basic security&#8221; exposed those victims&#8217; data, because of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kmj4v/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak">an unsecured Amazon cloud storage server</a> that was spilling the data its spyware was collecting from more than 2,000 victims&#8217; phones. SpyFone said it partnered with a cybersecurity firm and law enforcement to investigate, but the FTC says it never did.</p>
<p>Practically, the ban means SpyFone and its CEO Zuckerman are banned from &#8220;offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,&#8221; making it harder for the company to operate. But FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a separate statement that stalkerware makers should also face criminal sanctions under U.S. computer hacking and wiretap laws.</p>
<p>The FTC has also ordered the company to delete all the data it &#8220;illegally&#8221; collected, and, also for the first time, notify victims that the app had been secretly installed on their devices.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business">a statement</a>, the FTC&#8217;s consumer protection chief Samuel Levine said: &#8220;This case is an important reminder that surveillance-based businesses pose a significant threat to our safety and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EFF, which launched the Coalition Against Stalkerware two years ago, a coalition of companies that detects, combats and raises awareness of stalkerware, praised the FTC&#8217;s order. &#8220;With the FTC now turning its focus to this industry, victims of stalkerware can begin to find solace in the fact that regulators are beginning to take their concerns seriously,&#8221; said EFF&#8217;s Eva Galperin and Bill Budington in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/victory-federal-trade-commission-bans-stalkerware-company-conducting-business">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>This is the FTC&#8217;s second order against a stalkerware maker. In 2019, the FTC settled with Retina-X after the company was hacked several times and eventually <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neqgn8/retina-x-spyware-shuts-down-apps">shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, several other stalkerware makers were either hacked or inadvertently exposed their own systems, including mSpy, Mobistealth, and Flexispy. Another stalkerware maker, ClevGuard, left thousands of hacked victims&#8217; phone data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">an exposed cloud server</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger bank <a href="https://www.point.app">Point</a> has raised a $46.5 million Series B funding round. The company offers an account associated with a debit card. And the startup positions itself as a premium debit card company and tries to offer credit card rewards with debit cards.</p>
<p>Existing investor Peter Thiel&#8217;s Valar Ventures is investing more money in the company and leading the Series B round. Other investors include Breyer Capital, YC Continuity and Human Capital. The company raised a $10.5 million Series A round 18 months ago and a seed round before that, which means that Point has raised $60 million in total.</p>
<p>Point wants to build the anti-credit card. The company tries to keep what’s best about credit cards but leave behind what’s not so good. Many people think credit cards are a slippery slope. If you spend too much money without realizing that you’re not going to be able to make ends meet, you’ll pay interests. Those interests can even make it harder to pay back your credit card debt.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=PwJJhmmSfn" data-secret="PwJJhmmSfn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That’s why credit card incentives are both attractive and scary. If you have enough savings or if you earn a lot of money, paying your credit card bill is not going to be an issue. But that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>Point tells you that you should ditch your credit card altogether. When you open a Point account, you can top it up with another debit card or set up direct deposits with your employer. Opening a Point account currently costs $49 per year. You get two free ATM withdrawals per month and you don’t pay any foreign transaction fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can safely spend money with your Point card. You know that you have enough money to pay for your purchases as it’s a debit card. Every time you want to buy something expensive, you have to top up your account first.</p>
<p>Point users earn points with every purchase. You get 5x points on subscriptions, such as Spotify and Netflix, 3x points on food deliveries and ridesharing, and 1x points on everything else. If you pay with your Point card, you also get trip cancellation insurance, car rental insurance, global travel assistance, phone insurance and new purchase insurance.</p>
<p>You can control the Point card from the Point app — you can lock it and unlock it whenever you want and you can choose to receive notifications whenever you want. The Point debit card also works with Apple Pay and Google Pay.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to hire more people, launch new features and introduce new products. In other words, don’t expect any major changes. But the company now has more money to expand more rapidly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based startup megacampus <a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a> is announcing a new program for early-stage startups looking for opportunities to join the Station F community — the FemTech Program. With this new program, the Station F team wants to put a spotlight on femtech startups and make it easier to start a femtech startup.</p>
<p>Station F is a massive building that used to be a rail freight depot. It has been completely renovated and it now acts as a flagship entity for the tech community in France. In addition to VC firms and public administrations, the startup campus has partnered with companies and universities so that they can run their own incubator at Station F.</p>
<p>And Station F also has its own programs operated by the Station F team. There’s the Fighters Program designed specifically for entrepreneurs coming from underprivileged backgrounds. And there’s the Founders Program for companies that are just getting started.</p>
<p>With the FemTech Program, Station F is adding a third in-house program. As the name suggests, the startup campus is looking for companies working on female health, women&#8217;s sexual health and more.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the topic, we thought it was both an opportunity and that startups urgently needed some help,” Station F director Roxanne Varza told me. “It’s still a little-known category, it’s still a taboo subject.”</p>
<p>While there are huge market opportunities when you build a femtech startup, entrepreneurs quickly realize that they have to overcome two obstacles. First, people in the tech ecosystem — and investors in particular — are still mostly men. They tend to overlook female-focused products and services.</p>
<p>Second, when VC firms raise money from bigger funds, limited partners usually have a set of vice clauses in their investment contracts. It means that most VC firms can’t invest in companies related to sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Startups tell us about their problems. We would like to do some lobbying for those startups,” Varza told me. “The idea is really to create a community first. That was the major pain point, making sure that those startups can get together.”</p>
<p>Station F will also provide workshops, facilitate introductions with potential partners in the tech community at large and provide office hours. For instance, the founders of <a href="https://helloclue.com">Clue</a> and <a href="https://www.avawomen.com">Ava</a> will participate in upcoming workshops.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2021, Station F already selected a handful of femtech startups to try out its program. Startups included <a href="https://www.intimately.co">Intimately</a>, <a href="https://talq-univers.com">TalQ</a>, <a href="https://puissante.co">Puissante</a> and <a href="https://www.sonio.ai">Sonio</a>. Applications for the first official batch start today on Station F’s <a href="https://stationf.co/apply/femtech">website</a> and will remain open for a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.homelight.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which operates a real estate technology platform, announced today that it has secured $100 million in a Series D round of funding and $263 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return backer Zeev Ventures led the equity round, which also included participation from Group 11, Stereo Capital, Menlo Ventures and Lydia Jett of the SoftBank Vision Fund. The financings bring the San Francisco-based company’s total raised since its 2012 inception to $530 million. The equity financing brings HomeLight’s valuation to $1.6 billion, which is about triple of what it was when it raised its $109 million in debt and equity in a Series C that was announced in November of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeev Ventures led that funding round, as well as its Series A in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest capital comes ahead of projected “3x” year-over-year growth, according to HomeLight founder and CEO Drew Uher, who projects that the company&#8217;s annual revenue will triple to over $300 million in 2021. Doing basic math, we can deduce that the company saw around $100 million in revenue in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, like many other real estate tech platforms, HomeLight has evolved its model. HomeLight’s initial product focused on using artificial intelligence to match consumers and real estate investors to agents. Since then, the company has expanded to also </span><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/homelight-launches-agent-services-to-help-agents-thrive-1028577713"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing title and escrow services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to agents and home sellers and matching sellers with iBuyers. In July 2019, HomeLight </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49530-homelight-acquires-digital-mortgage-startup-eave-expands-into-mortgage-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Eave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an entry into the (increasingly crowded) mortgage lending space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to remove as much friction as possible from the process of buying or selling a home,” Uher said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2020, HomeLight launched its flagship financial products, HomeLight Trade-In and HomeLight Cash Offer. Since then, it has grown those products by over 700%, Uher said, in part fueled by the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight’s Trade-In product gives its clients greater control over the timeline of their move and ability to transact, and Cash Offer gives people a way to make all cash offers on homes, “even if they need a mortgage,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic only highlighted many of the pain points in the real estate transaction process that we’ve been focused on solving since our founding,” Uher told TechCrunch. &#8220;Between the real estate industry’s historic information asymmetry, outdated processes and unreasonable costs &#8212; not to mention today’s record-low inventory and all-time high bidding wars &#8212; buying or selling a home can be an incredibly difficult process, even without the challenges put in place by a global pandemic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197292" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197292" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197292 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197292" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HomeLight</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in August 2020, the company acquired Disclosures.io and launched HomeLight Listing Management, with the goal of making it easier for agents to share property information, monitor buyer interest and manage offers in one place. </span></p>
<p>In June of 2021, HomeLight appointed Lyft chairman and former Trulia CFO Sean Aggarwal to its board.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uher founded HomeLight after he and his wife felt the pain of trying to buy a home in the competitive Bay Area market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process of buying a home in San Francisco was so frustrating it made me want to bang my head against the wall,” Uher told me at the time of HomeLight’s Series C. “I realized there were so many things wrong with the real estate industry. I went through a few real estate agents before finding the right match. So when I did find one, it made me feel empowered to compete and win against the other buyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started HomeLight with a single product, its agent matching platform, which uses “proprietary machine-learning algorithms” to analyze millions of real estate transactions and agent profiles. It claims to connect a client to a real estate agent on average “every 90 seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Uher said that hundreds of thousands of agents have applied to be a part of the HomeLight agent network and that it has worked with over 1 million homebuyers and sellers in the U.S. Today, the company works closely with the top 28,000 of those agents across the country. HomeLight maintains that it is not trying to replace real estate agents, but instead work more collaboratively with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uher said the company plans to use its new capital in part toward expanding to new markets its Trade-In and Cash Offer operations. HomeLight Trade-In and Cash Offer are currently available in California, Texas and, more recently, in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We plan to expand as quickly as we can across the entire country,” Uher said. “We also plan to hire aggressively in 2021 and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight presently has over 500 employees, up from about 350 at the end of last year. The company has offices in Scottsdale, Arizona, San Francisco, New York, Seattle and Tampa, and plans to open new sites throughout the U.S. in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures, said he believes that HomeLIght is better positioned than any other proptech company “to reinvent the transaction experience” for agents and their clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the onset of iBuyers and other technology introduced in the past decade, many proptech companies are building products to cut agents out of the transaction process entirely,” Zeev wrote via email. &#8220;This is where HomeLight uniquely differs &#8212; and excels &#8212; from its competitors&#8230;They’re in the perfect position to revolutionize the industry.&#8221;</span></p>
