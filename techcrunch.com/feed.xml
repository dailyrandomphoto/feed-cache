										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal AI</a>, an artificial intelligence startup that trawls the vast sea of internet and other publicly available data to provide organizations with sentiment insights and other information to make better business decisions, has raised $50 million. It plans to use the funds to continue building out its AI platform to bring in more diversified data sources, in order to extract insights across an ever-wider range of business questions that a person might ask.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Organizations still don’t have an effective radar to get ahead of threats and opportunities, and turning challenges into opportunities,&#8221; said David Benigson, the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview. The aggregate hundreds of sources of data &#8212; from social and news media through to 25,000 podcasts, regulatory filings and other public records &#8212; into a single platform.</p>
<p class="p7">It then applies machine learning and other AI techniques to extract insights from it all based on natural language questions posed by Signal AI customers. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been diversifying the data that we inject in the platform,&#8221; he added. Signal AI currently works across some 100 languages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a Series D, and it is being led by Highland Europe, with new backer abrdn plus previous backers Redline (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/signal-ai-taps-25m-for-public-data-based-market-intelligence-that-spots-trends-and-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led Signal AI&#8217;s Series C in 2019</a>), MMC, and strategic backers Hearst and Guardian Media Group Ventures also participating. London-based Signal AI has now raised $100 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Benigson said it grew 100% over the last round.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/103080-70/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PItchBook estimates</a> that valuation was around $100 million at that point (in 2019), which would put it at $200 million now, if that figure is accurate. In any case, Signal AI itself has definitely grown. Benigson said that the startup now works with 40% of the Fortune 500, with its customer base including Deloitte, Bank of America and Google.</p>
<p>The challenge that Signal has identified and is building to fix is one that we all encounter every day, but feels particularly acute when it involves businesses navigating tricky issues with potentially billions of dollars of investment at stake if they take the wrong turn.</p>
<p>The internet has equipped us with a vast trove of information, but not always the best keys and maps for unlocking and getting around it, especially when the answers we are looking for are not straightforward, as they are in the case of more fluffy questions around sentiment analysis, or &#8220;answers&#8221; that are actually a collation of information from a number of sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a number of companies that have also identified this gap and are building to solve it, including Dataminr (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a huge round this year at $4.1 billion valuation</a>), Meltwater (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MWTR.OL?p=MWTR.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly traded</a> and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/meltwater-has-acquired-datasift-to-double-down-on-social-media-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring businesses</a> to build out its technology muscle), and Cision (now privately held and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/brandwatch-is-acquired-by-cision-for-450m-creating-a-pr-marketing-and-social-listening-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making big acquisitions to grow</a>).</p>
<p>Much of the emphasis and impetus for these companies started and still sits squarely in the area of media monitoring &#8212; a huge business tapped not just by other media sources but by companies themselves. Indeed, Signal AI itself used to be called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/ai-fueled-market-intelligence-firm-signal-media-takes-16m-to-tackle-more-targets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal Media</a> and focused mainly on this area as well.</p>
<p>That in itself is still a big market that is worth disrupting &#8212; the old school way of approaching this was to collate media clippings, provided to clients; the new approach is not just to collate mentions but to deliver more summarized information and insights gleaned from those clips. The more the internet grows, the more clips there will be, and so in fact simply getting a pile of them becomes untenable for even the most enthusiastic teams of communications specialists.</p>
<p>Even so, that model set up for more intelligent media monitoring also paves the way for applying the same format and algorithms to a much wider set of use cases, which is the premise Signal AI has been building upon.</p>
<p>A large part of its work, thus, still remains focused on providing insights to people working around communications strategy, but it&#8217;s deepening the types of information it can provide to them by way of its AIQ platform (as Signal calls it).</p>
<p>Benigson notes that this now includes, for example, more information and &#8220;insights&#8221; for a company on potential business partners; getting up to speed on an aspect of diversity and inclusion and how it&#8217;s being approached by others; a pending decision on environmental strategy; and data to inform a company&#8217;s strategy on regulatory compliance in areas like taxes or data protection.</p>
<p>While comparisons to companies like Dataminr are fair, Benigson said, Signal AI differs from these as it provides more context both in the kinds of queries that can be asked by users, and in the responses that are given. Alongside its business growth, that richer experience is another reason why investors are interested in seeing how the startup will grow.</p>
<p>“Signal AI is a stand out category defining business” said Tony Zappalà, a partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “We are excited to be involved with the next chapter of the company’s innovative growth. David and the leadership team have a clear vision for the decision augmentation category they are helping to define and as Gartner’s research has shown, the opportunity is huge.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-80-million-after-getting-federal-banking-charter/">raising</a> an $80 million Series C round, <a href="https://www.anchorage.com">Anchorage</a> is announcing that it has raised a $350 million Series D round. With today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>Anchorage offers a custody solution for big institutions, such as publicly traded companies or funds. On top of that, Anchorage lets you trade crypto assets, stake assets to earn returns and participate in protocol governance if you own a lot of tokens for a specific protocol.</p>
<p>For instance, one transaction has been particularly commented. Back in August, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/visa-enters-nfts-cryptopunk-7610-acquisition-interview">Visa acquired a CryptoPunk</a> for 49.5 ETH. At the time, it represented around $150,000. Behind the scenes, Anchorage handled the transaction for Visa.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>KKR is leading the round, with many, many different investors also participating. So take a deep breath and try to read this sentence out loud in one try: Goldman Sachs, Alameda Research, Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo credit funds, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Blockchain Capital, Delta Blockchain Fund, Elad Gil, GIC, GoldenTree Asset Management, Innovius Capital, Kraken, Lux Capital, PayPal Ventures, Senator Investment Group, Standard Investments, Thoma Bravo and Wellington Management</p>
<p>You may wonder why such a big group of investors want to put some money in Anchorage. That’s because Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank. It differentiates Anchorage from many custodian products out there.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to improve its product, especially for global financial firms and other fintech companies. Customers can also expect more features with more integrations with DeFi products.</p>
<p>“As a pioneer in enabling institutional investors to access digital assets, Anchorage has built a best in class, institutional grade digital asset platform that combines the best practices of both modern security and usability. We are thrilled to lead this Series D round and work with Diogo, Nathan and their talented team as they continue to support the institutional adoption of digital assets through their differentiated, regulated and integrated suite of solutions,” KKR’s Technology Growth Equity senior leader Ben Pederson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past year, Anchorage has increased its number of clients by 96%. The company’s headcount has also increased by quite a lot with a 175% jump compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>With its federal banking charter, Anchorage has a good barrier to entry in case other companies want to compete in the same space. As companies realize that crypto assets are more than a fad, they’ll increasingly look for trustworthy partners to interact with the crypto ecosystem. And some of them will certainly end up working with Anchorage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you think of <a href="https://pabio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pabio</a> as &#8220;Stitchfix for furniture, in Europe,&#8221; you&#8217;re probably pretty close to the mark. The company started in Switzerland a couple of years ago with a mission to stop people from buying disposable Ikea stuff for a two-year stint in an apartment, replacing it with well-styled, well-thought-out interior design suggestions and robust, reusable and recyclable furniture. Today it announced it expanded into Germany and raised a drawer-full of cash to expand its marketing and to reach into additional European countries.</p>
<p>With Pabio, customers can request a personalized interior design proposal with photorealistic renders of what their fully furnished apartment will look like. They upload a floor plan and take some photos, and Pabio generates a 3D model of their apartment, furniture and all. If the customer likes it, they can subscribe to their furniture, delivered, installed and insured, for a monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people would not pay for an Airbnb if it looks like the apartment they live in. We figured maybe there&#8217;s something there. We got into the interior design and furniture space,&#8221; explains Carlo Badini, co-founder and CEO of Pabio. &#8220;We came up with the idea of marrying interior design with furniture subscription to make nice living affordable to those who rent only for a couple of years.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Ikea &#8212; just like the furniture industry in general &#8212; it tries to portray itself as sustainable, but most furniture is never recycled. The business model for &#8216;fast furniture&#8217; is &#8216;how much can we sell and how frequently&#8217;. In our case, it&#8217;s the exact opposite. Because we offer a subscription, we&#8217;re motivated to keep your stuff in your apartment as long as possible, which means we offer high-quality stuff that can last for decades,&#8221; says Anand Chowdhary, CTO at Pabio. &#8220;Furniture used to be high quality. If you go to your grandparents&#8217; house, you see that the dining table is 20 years old. That was the point of furniture before fast furniture became a trend. We are a new take on that same idea &#8212; that furniture should be long-lasting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get to the end of your subscription, and you move away, we would take all the furniture back. We will refurbish it and put it in a new apartment. That means we&#8217;re optimizing that whole process of how quickly can we put the furniture into a new apartment at a discounted price,&#8221; says Badini. &#8220;Three or four cycles later, when that furniture is actually fully worn down, we would recycle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pricing for the service is aimed to be reasonably competitive compared to buying your own furniture &#8212; a one-bedroom apartment, fully furnished, lands in the sub-€200 (US$225) range per month, often significantly below that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our target is that we want to be at a maximum of 15% of the rent you are paying,&#8221; comments Chowdhary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s a great time to build a rent-to-own company. It’s very hard for millenials to pay tens of thousands of dollars up front to get furniture for their apartment. Pabio makes this easy and affordable without compromising on quality,&#8221; said Tim Brady, partner at Y Combinator.</p>
<p>The company is currently deploying its furniture rental services to around 100 homes. Previously, <a href="https://pabio.com/blog/company/1-million-pre-seed-y-combinator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="il">Pabio</span> raised a $1 million pre-seed round</a>. This time around, it adds an additional $2.2 million round, which includes Serpentine Ventures, <a href="http://session.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://session.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639602372848000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3P2fjFuDrpWY5coqOsozTt">Session.VC</a>,  <a href="http://tomahawk.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://tomahawk.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1639602372848000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NUdWn39_9fCIVwAiLOrtq">Tomahawk.VC</a>, Pioneer Fund, and DD Venture Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, offline test preparation centers in Nigeria have provided after-school guidance and tutoring to students who seek to pass entrance examinations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edtech platforms such as <a href="https://edukoya.com/">Edukoya</a> have sprung up with the intent to take these models online and maintain affordability for students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Lagos- and London-based startup, which builds online education content and offers online tutoring for students and their parents, raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding led by European VC firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/target-global-early-stage-fund-ii/">Target Global</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a range of features such as a 24/7 exam preparation and homework help, a question bank with step-by-step workings and personalized performance tracking systems.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya was founded by CEO <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/honeyogundeyi">Honey Ogundeyi</a> in May. She told TechCrunch that the platform, launched this month in beta, plans to go live fully in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s education system is a stark representation of what exists in most countries in Africa: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equipped classrooms, few high-quality teachers, terrible infrastructure, irrelevant curriculum, and ridiculous student-to-teacher ratios (it’s been as <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS?locations=NG">high as 46:1</a> in Nigeria for the primary level).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s a result of these challenges, the average parent seeks after-school classes for their kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ogundeyi experienced this during her schooling days in Nigeria, and she said she started Edukoya after contrasting K-12 experiences in the West African country and the U.K.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes, even the most brilliant students can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be let </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">down by the system,” she said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If my parents hadn’t made the sacrifice for me to go abroad, all the successes that I’ve had in my career would have been completely different</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, I have two kids, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeing that same problem of going to school and struggling with some subjects made me look into getting after-school teachers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struck me that this thing hasn’t changed pretty much for the last 50 years. If we look at all the innovation across different industries, Africa’s education system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has remained </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">untouched for 50 years; it’s been stagnant.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of every K-12 education, the goal of most students is to get into a university. Like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., where the SAT is the standardized test for college admissions, the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) and West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) are the equivalents for university admissions in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> practice for these exams with materials containing previous test questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Edukoya bundled these practice tests for both entrance exams (about 20,000) into its mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya said it provides step-by-step solutions to “solve tough problems on past examination papers,” a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students can connect to experienced tutors to help them out whenever they are stuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform then provides insights with scores, time spent per question and other stats to help students identify their strengths and areas for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the few months that the platform has been in beta with a handful of users, Edukoya claims that </span>96% of students using its platform received higher marks during recent tests than when they didn’t use Edukoya.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya isn’t the first edtech startup to have launched an online learning or test preparation application in Nigeria. So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many similar platforms cropped up in the last five years that it seemed it was the only brand of edtech that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of them have closed or achieved little or no scale. Edukoya has yet to do either. But after raising the largest pre-seed round in Nigeria and on the continent, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve a grander scale than its predecessors, which only secured paltry sums of VC money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Ogundeyi believes Edukoya’s approach to learning makes it stand out from its competition and previous platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This model is unique in that we are reaching parents and learners 100% online and supporting them not only across exams but also the day-to-day learning, homework, support, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Edukoya goes beyond exam prep. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an educational partner to parents and learners in primary and secondary school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen people tackle smaller pockets in different ways, but not in a holistic way that we’re thinking about it,” she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247713" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247713" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2247713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edukoya</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most edtechs that play in this space tend to launch their platforms for grades 1-12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Edukoya is looking at it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform is only available to students in grades 10-12, the segment taking exams into tertiary institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi said that once the company tests with this very tight segment and five core subjects, it will open up to cover more subjects and other grade levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explaining why the company adopted this strategy, the CEO said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s from my core focus &#8212; one of the things I got from Google, which is to make a core group of people love you first. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working with the last three grades, which are very important in Nigeria because that’s where people take those exams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is a good sort of test bucket to work with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> core group of people who need an intervention in that space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once we have proven that it works here, it’s easier for us to expand it across other curriculum years and grades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya is free now, but Ogundeyi said the company would explore a freemium model where premium products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upsell students or parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi noted that Edukoya would need to keep sourcing experienced teachers to provide tutoring services for this to happen. For new-age edtechs, including YC-backed Kenyan startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/">Kidato</a>, Tencent and Owl Ventures portfolio company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/african-edtech-startup-ulesson-raises-15m-backed-by-nielsen-ventures-and-tencent/">uLesson</a>, targeting these three communities (students, teachers and parents) is paramount from day one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the CEO’s first spell at running a startup. In 2014, she founded Fashpa, a Nigerian fashion e-commerce store. Her professional career spans consulting and managerial roles at McKinsey &amp; Company, Ericsson, Google and UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was also the founding CMO of Kuda, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Nigerian neobank</a> founded Babs Ogundeyi. He is one of the angel investors in this round; others include his co-founder Musty Mustapha, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, Stash founders Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson, and Aux Money CEO Raffael Johnen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linachong/">Lina Chong</a>, the investment director at Target Global, confirmed her firm’s investment, saying, “Edukoya’s mission to provide better quality to millions of African students, combined with the team’s ability to execute on this ambition, left an immediate impression on myself and the whole team at Target Global. Their business has the potential to unlock learner potential and improve lives across generations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi mentioned that a bulk of the pre-seed funding would expand its team and learner base and build out the technology for its learning platform, including support for its pan-African and European developer hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO was one of the earliest female founders in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years after her first startup, she has now raised the largest round at this stage in this “minority class.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though she’s impressed by the quality of female founders springing forth and the check sizes they are commanding, she said it’s still early days for her clique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been in this space for a long time and I’m particularly passionate about female founders and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding the scope of what we can do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make that segmentation so much. Given the right opportunity and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right experience, female founders can build big valuable businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> day one for us as part of that journey.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://www.4dxventures.com/">4DX Ventures</a> has completed the final close of its second fund at $60 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second fund, launched in the first quarter of this year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to close at $50 million, but investor and limited partner (LP) interest saw the fund oversubscribed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LPs involved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unnamed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include U.S.-based asset managers, a university endowment, global family offices, tech founders, hedge fund portfolio managers and investors from private equity and venture capital, the firm said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort by the New York, Accra and Cairo-based firm, an early investor in African unicorns Flutterwave and Andela, follows large fund closes by the likes of Partech, Novastar, Algebra and TLcom Capital that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sporadically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happened on the continent.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With large funds, most of these firms tend to find their sweet spots in growth-stage deals, particularly in Series A and B. But recently, they are beginning to get involved in earlier rounds to gain stakes to help them compete for the late-stage investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, TLcom Capital, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million pan-African fund</a> that initially made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments only in the growth stage, led pre-seed rounds in Nigeria&#8217;s Okra and Autochek last year (it co-led the latter with 4DX Ventures).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-seed to Series B are the stages on which 4DX Ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founding partners Walter Baddoo and Peter Orth told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The quality of founders and team is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our North Star. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And our goal is to partner with the very best teams going after transformative opportunities across the continent,&#8221; Orth said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And you know, Walter and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have experienced investing in companies from the idea stage to public markets and, generally speaking, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that from the pre-seed to Series B stage, it&#8217;s still early enough to deliver the type of returns that we&#8217;re looking for as an early-stage fund.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founding partners have known each other for more than 20 years. Between them, they have years of operational and financial experience working at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Bridgewater Associates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started 4DX Ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017 after three years of investing personal funds in African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Global talent marketplace Andela and payments company Flutterwave were part of the firm&#8217;s early success, generating significant secondary returns due to their unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures&#8217; first fund was a bit over $20 million and it invested in startups such as Ghanaian health tech startup mPharma and Kenyan B2B e-commerce platform Sokowatch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has welcomed the likes of Autochek, Breadfast, MaxAB, Taager, Trella and Yoco from this second fund of $60 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African VC firms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predominantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> write their checks to the Big Four markets: Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya because that&#8217;s where most of the continent&#8217;s opportunities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reside</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different, as most of its portfolio companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in these four countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Orth is quick to add that the firm has begun looking into other countries, especially in the Francophone region; case in point, the investment it co-led into Ivorian fintech CinetPay this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for industries, 4DX Ventures says it is a &#8220;generalist,&#8221; but most of its investments have taken place </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in fintech, B2B e-commerce, healthcare and logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in companies that are building products that solve foundational problems on the continent and also in the largest markets because the size of the market matters quite a bit for the potential outcome of companies,&#8221; Baddoo said about the markets and industries that pique 4DX&#8217;s interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And so we love when folks are building products in markets that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> large, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give the companies that opportunity to have a pretty dramatic growth path throughout their lifecycle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baddoo also highlighted that asides from the market and industries, 4DX Ventures also seeks &#8220;strong founders with a growth mindset who have a lot of grit&#8221; and can &#8220;marry a very clear vision of what they&#8217;re trying to build with a thoughtful approach to strategy and execution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pan-African firm writes checks of about &#8220;a few $100,000 to a few million&#8221; across all stages (pre-seed to Series B), according to Orth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching its first fund, 4DX Ventures has invested in more than 40 companies across Africa (its primary market), the Middle East and the U.S., with a handful of companies. One of its portfolio companies, U.S.-based Swarm Technologies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/#:~:text=SpaceX%20to%20acquire%20satellite%20connectivity%20startup%20Swarm%20Technologies,-Aria%20Alamalhodaei%40breadfrom&amp;text=SpaceX%20will%20be%20acquiring%20satellite,as%20a%20ground%20station%20network.">got acquired by SpaceX</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures says its portfolio companies have raised more than $1.2 billion in funding, one of the largest follow-on investments known for an African-focused fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close of this second fund also brought </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience to the firm&#8217;s management team in two general partners, Dan Marlo and Raaid Ahmad. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their appointment, the pair served as senior advisors to the firm since 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both bring years of experience operating, investing and advising companies in various sectors such as fintech, telco, software, sports, social and health, the firm said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both Dan Marlo and Raaid have been senior advisors to 4DX since the beginning of the fund. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them joining as senior advisors, we&#8217;ve known each other for a decade. They are both experienced operators who have a scarce combination of skill sets. And going into our next Fund and the future of the company, we couldn&#8217;t think of two better people to join to help us, you know, carry the firm into our next chapter here,&#8221; said Orth on the appointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA Hall of Famer and Congolese-American former professional basketball player Dikembe Mutombo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his humanitarian and entrepreneurial work, especially for Africans and African Americans, will now serve in the firm&#8217;s senior advisory role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He joins a current senior advisor roster that includes Karen Karniol-Tambour of Bridgewater Associates, Jay Zaveri of Social Capital and Sakya Duvvuru of Nellore Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baddoo, who is Ghanaian by birth, is bullish on his firm&#8217;s work and hinted that his association with the continent is part of what drives the deals 4DX Ventures makes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Growing up in Accra, Ghana, a lot of these companies are solving problems that I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> firsthand.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And so the fact that we can dedicate our time to back some of the greatest founders of this generation that are building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> special and important companies on a continent, to me, is a dream. And the ability to do that where I come from is quite important. So my hope and belief is that 4DX will continue to play a very pivotal role in the ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uni, an Indian startup that offers users pay-later cards, has raised $70 million in a financing round as it looks to broaden its product offerings in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>General Catalyst led the one-year-old startup’s Series A funding. Eight Roads Ventures, Elevation Capital, Arbor Ventures as well as existing investors Lightspeed and Accel participated in the round.</p>
<p>The new round, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/india-uni-credit-card-startup-raises-18-5-million/">follows last year’s $18.5 million seed funding</a>, values Uni at about $350 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. TechCrunch reported earlier that Uni <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/indian-fintech-cred-seeks-funds-at-5-5-billion-valuation/">was in talks</a> to raise a round at over $300 million valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="http://uni.cards">Uni</a> is among a handful of startups in India that is attempting to bring the benefits of credit cards to the masses. Even as nearly a billion Indians have a bank account, only a sliver of this population is covered by the country’s young credit rating system.</p>
<p>Fewer than 30 million Indians have a credit card today, which has created a huge whitespace for startups like Uni and Tiger Global-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">Slice</a> to innovate on tech and reach more consumers. Uni offers its customers a pay-later card that automatically splits the bill in three parts spread across three months. If customers pay within the three months, they are not charged any interest fee. If they settle the bill in one month, they get a 1% cashback reward.</p>
<p>The startup, which uses its own underwriting tech to determine applicants&#8217; credit worthiness, launched the card in June this year and says it is already disbursing $23 million to its customers each month. The startup did not disclose how many users it has amassed, but said its customers are spread across 50 Indian cities.</p>

<p>Nitin Gupta, who co-founded PayU India and then ran ride-hailing firm Ola&#8217;s financial services business, co-founded Uni last year. Lightspeed and Accel backed the startup at a time when it had yet to launch a product.</p>
<p>“The Indian credit market is ripe for explosion and there is vast room for innovation. We found a strong product-market fit with our very first product, the Pay 1/3rd card &#8211; a first of its kind card in the market and haven’t looked back from there,&#8221; said Gupta. &#8220;BNPL [buy now, pay later] is growing at a breakneck speed in India and within BNPL we are seeing that the biggest potential lies in the Pay1/3rd category and we are leading this space with our innovative product and customer experience. We are delighted to have some of the best investors in the world partnering with us as we gear up for our next phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Gupta said the startup is working on developing a number of new products and aims to expand its monthly disbursement to $197 million in the next nine months.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to be partnering with Nitin, Prateek, Laxmikant and the rest of the Uni team as they build category defining financial services products for Indian consumers,&#8221; said Alex Tran, Managing Director at General Catalyst, in a statement. &#8220;There are few countries in the world where the opportunity for credit expansion is as massive as in India, and we believe some iconic companies will be built to capture this opportunity in the next decade. We are excited to back a team that is world-class on credit, risk, and payments while also being hyper focused on product and customer delight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only earlier this week that we learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/studyfree-an-international-student-scholarships-and-grants-platform-raises-3m-seed/">StudyFree</a> — which connects students with international educational opportunities — had raised a $3 million seed round. But there’s more to this than being accepted on a traditional course. The pandemic has turned education into a remote industry, and tech startups have responded.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.educate-online.io/">Educate Online</a> is a platform allowing international students to study at UK, US, and Canadian schools, but there’s a twist. All the study is done online, remotely, full-time or part-time, without having to move to another country and bear the related costs.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $4 million in Seed funding from Xploration Capital, TMT Investments, Flyer One Ventures, Softline, and Angelsdeck.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the past 12 months, the startup says it’s garnered 2,500 students from 18 countries, covering K-12 study, ESOL, career exploration, university preparation, and internship &amp; mentorship programs.</p>
<p>The platform also offers options for students to participate in on-campus summer or semester programs. It now plans to scale in LATAM, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Competitors include agencies that are still focused on offline education such as <a href="https://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0507/schooling_children_abroad.shtml">Transitions Abroad</a>, <a href="https://smapse.com/how-to-choose-a-school-abroad-for-a-child/">Smapse</a> and <a href="https://academicfamilies.com/agents-international-student-recruitment/">Academic Families</a>.</p>
<p>Alexander Zheltov, co-founder and CEO of Educate Online, said: “Educate Online was founded in 2018 and since then has placed more than 4,000+ children between the ages of 4-19 in top schools. After COVID-19 hit, we made a hard pivot to online education as we were seeing a surge of interest towards online education – in 2020 we grew 5.5 times and we expect to continue growing 3-5x year-over-year”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eugene Timko, Managing Partner at Xploration Capital said: “Schools have historically been very local operations. Few have branched out to other countries, primarily through building foreign campuses and local partnerships. This has significantly limited the potential reach for international school education. Educate Online may become the dominant online layer on top of the existing schools’ infrastructure, vastly expanding the current market for cross-border education&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Battlefield (NYC 2014) finalists <a href="https://www.mimi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimi Hearing Technologies</a> just closed its $25 million Series B funding to continue whispering its mission of hearing well-being from the rooftops. The company recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/mimi-partnerships/">announced a series of high-profile partnerships with Skullcandy, Cleer and Beyerdynamic</a>, and is now plowing onwards with its fresh infusion of cash from <a href="https://www.mig-fonds.de/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIG Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/athos-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATHOS</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scope for software-based solutions that can deal with things beyond hearing difficulties,&#8221; Nick Clark, one of the founders of Mimi, who heads up the company&#8217;s R&amp;D, told me a while back. &#8220;You can start doing subtle things that benefit a broader and broader audience depending on their differences in hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mimi has one of the most popular at-home hearing testing apps, where around 50,000 people per month test their hearing. The company has made the same technology available to headphone manufacturers as an SDK. The apps can then use these hearing profiles to create customized audio outputs specifically tailored to your hearing. That means that it&#8217;s possible to hear better without turning the volume up to make up for the areas of your hearing where you may have hearing loss. The theory is that this prevents further hearing loss.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You can buy Skullcandy headphones, download the application and you create your profile there,&#8221; explains Mimi&#8217;s CEO and founder Philipp Skribanowitz. &#8220;But this profile is also compatible with other partners, and you can use it everywhere. We also have developed tests on a TV for Philips, so you just sit on your couch and do the test on your TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money is earmarked for further investment in the company&#8217;s technology, especially in terms of expanding its offerings across headphone and TV integrations. The company will also be ramping up the expansion of sales and marketing operations across the U.S. and Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leading investors of our Series B consortium &#8212; MIG, Athos and Salvia &#8212; garnered international attention last year as the founding investors in BioNTech, the Nasdaq-listed German biotech company that, together with Pfizer, developed the first COVID-19 vaccine and is now valued at approximately $70 billion,&#8221; noted Mimi CFO Moritz Bratzke. &#8220;Their investment in Mimi is another testament not only to the depth and breadth of the German venture capital climate, but also to the importance and tremendous commercial potential of Mimi’s vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenyan startup <a href="https://www.wowzi.co">Wowzi</a> has secured new funding to expand the reach of its platform, which turns social media users into brand influencers, to West and Southern Africa &#8212; as it taps the increasing usage of social sites across the continent driven by the proliferation of smartphones and a deepening <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">internet penetration</a>.</p>
<p>Wowzi, which connects social media users with advertisers and provides consumer insights, has secured a total of $3.2 million from investors over the last few months, part of which includes a recently concluded $2 million seed round that was led by the Africa-focused venture capital firm 4DX Ventures. This was preceded by a $1.2 million pre-seed round.</p>
<p>Other investors in the seed round were To.org, Golden Palm Investments, LoftyInc Capital, Afropreneur Angels, and Future Africa. Andela co-founder Christina Sass, and former Andela executives Jessica Chervin, Justin Ziegler, as well as Johnny Falla, who currently serves as chief development and growth officer at Wowzi, took part in the round too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wowzi plans to use the new investment to set up operations in Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, seeking growth opportunities beyond Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, where it currently has a physical presence. It plans to use these new hubs to enter more countries across the continent.</p>
<p>“We are primarily focused on expanding across Africa in 2022 and in other emerging markets globally,” Wowzi co-founder and CEO, Brian Mogeni, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are also adding new product capabilities and features, as we continue to develop our technology and provide additional value to our communities,” he said.</p>
<p>Wowzi makes it possible for brands to partner with social media users for marketing campaigns. This a new form of digital marketing that pivots from the norm of using celebrities for marketing campaigns. Wowzi said by using normal internet users, it is tapping “more authentic engagements or product endorsements&#8221; from people who interact with these brands on a daily basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup also relieves brands from the stress of managing influencers as the platform operates in an automated fashion. To post a campaign, brands filter out their preferred influencer demographic groups based on characteristics like gender, location, profession or income levels. Wowzi then matches them with with the right type of influencers for their needs. The brands then refine their search (based on the content shared or level of activity) and then reach out to the influencers they desire.</p>
<p>“Managing influencers is difficult; from establishing contact, negotiations, contracting, ensuring that content is delivered and is posted on time to following up on payment. It is a lot of work. We manage the entire process with the brand to make sure that it&#8217;s successful,” said Falla</p>
<p>Wowzi influencers are categorized as nano, micro, mega, meta and super (celebrities), and they carry out marketing campaigns for brands via their social media accounts on sites like Tik Tok, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. However, Wowzi’s focus is mainly on nano and micro influencers (social media users with less than 10,000 followers).</p>
<p>Anyone with at least 250 (nano influencers) connections on a social site fits the profile of a Wowzi influencer, but interested candidates must go through several verification levels before they start getting gigs.</p>
<p>“Brands want to have more authentic engagements or endorsements for products, from people who use and love them, and can talk about real practical applications. Our campaigns show that nano influencers deliver better sales leads because of the higher trust with their following,” Falla told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Brands also access a community of their most likely customers, and so this makes the campaigns hyper targeted for them as well,” said Falla.</p>

<p>Wowzi works with creative agencies or directly with brands to help them scale their campaigns. It has so far worked with Coca Cola, Netflix, Safaricom, Diageo, P&amp;G and Absa Bank.</p>
<p>The processes are automated, which means that brands get data they can use to evaluate the reach of the marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>“We offer a really comprehensive reporting dashboard online. So, brands can check in to see exactly what happened, what posts were made by the influencers, which ones performed the best and analytics of the demographics for people who were actually reached,” said Falla.</p>
<p>Wowzi is the brainchild of Mogeni, Hassan Bashir and Mike Otieno, who co-founded the company mid-2019 but the platform went live a day before Kenya’s president imposed the first lockdown last year. As it later turned out, a window of opportunity opened as more brands realized that they had to adopt other ways of marketing as travel and human interaction remained limited.</p>
<p>The startup has so far worked with 200 brands, carried out over 15,000 campaigns and delivered over 200,000 paid gigs to date. Wowzi has grown 20-fold over the last one year.</p>
<p>More recently, brands are able to post market research jobs including the engagement of influencers in polls or surveys. This is part of Wowzi’s plan to grow beyond an influencer marketing platform to a jobs aggregator.</p>
<p>“We recently rolled out a market intelligence service which enables the same brands, SMEs or development agencies to pull information in a faster, targeted and richer format from their focal segments,” said Mogeni.</p>
<p>Wowzi is now eyeing over 1 million job opportunities in the short term as it establishes a strong pan-African presence. This goal is achievable for the startup, which has successfully conducted campaigns across multiple markets in Africa including Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia and Cameroon.</p>
<p>“We actually had our first engagement in Cameroon recently after Netflix asked us to work with them in an additional eight countries. And so, what we have seen is that we can scale easily, even without the need for a physical presence,” said Falla.</p>
<p>Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA Mobile Economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. This is expected to grow to about 40% of the population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Wowzi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve visited Brinc’s headquarters the last few times I’ve been to Hong Kong, and been impressed with the range of different startups the accelerator works with. I knew the organization primary through its consumer hardware companies &#8212; a primary focus when it was founded, back in 2014.</p>
<p>Brinc has expanded its scope a fair bit in the intervening years, with big focuses on things like food, health and deep tech. Seems it’s set to continue expanding its reach, going forward with eyes on categories like web3 and NFTs. Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands appears to be playing a big role in the move. Last year, the pair launched the blockchain/NFT accelerator Launchpad Luna.</p>
<p>Animoca is also leading a $30 million Series B round for Brinc that finds the accelerator looking to expand its offering of programming, adding locations and hiring additional headcount. In a call with TechCrunch, Brinc co-founder Bay McLaughlin pointed at a number of markets in Asia as targets for potential expansion, including Japan, Korea, Singapore and India, as well as added presence in China.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In November, the company is also opening an office in Brazil &#8212; its first in Latin America. In all, Brinc currently sports seven offices, with people operating out of a total of 12 locations.</p>
<p>In addition to the Series B participation, Animoca will also be investing $100 million directly into startups through Brinc, in a manner similar to a VC fund.</p>
<p>“Brinc is the leading name in startup acceleration for emerging markets and technologies, and its sights are set firmly on the future and on sustainability,” Animoca chairman and founder Yat Siu said in a release tied to the news. “We share a common vision of an open future with blockchain adoption in traditional and growth sectors, and we look forward to the innovations that will emerge from its acceleration programs.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norwest Venture Partners</a>, the now 60-year-old venture and growth equity firm backed entirely by the banking giant Wells Fargo, today rolled out its sixteenth fund, a $3 billion vehicle and its biggest to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to shrug off the development, but this new pool brings the assets Norwest has raised altogether across the decades to $12.5 billion. Put another way, despite that gigantic fund announcements have become routine, this one is kind of a big deal and another indicator that this market is a very different one from even five years ago.</p>
<p>Certainly, one can see why, in a go-go environment, Wells might agree to such a commitment. For one thing, on the growth equity side, it&#8217;s not possible to compete anymore unless you have a ginormous money cannon. Consider that Tiger Global Management alone held a <em>first close</em> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/tiger-global-raises-8-8-billion-in-first-close-of-biggest-fund?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8.8 billion</a> on its biggest fund ever back in October, according to Bloomberg. (As a reminder, it closed its previous fund with $6.7 billion just six months ago.) To win deals, you need to be able to elbow out at least some of the other multibillion-dollar funds that are also writing checks right now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247538" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Norwest&#8217;s team also has a lot of hits about which to boast. While it was busy deploying its last fund, a $2 billion pool that it closed in 2019 and used to fund about 60 companies &#8212; almost 30 of Norwest&#8217;s earlier bets have &#8220;exited&#8221; in some fashion over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The security outfit Shape Security, for example, sold to the application delivery company F5 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/f5-acquires-shape-security-for-1b/">$1 billion</a> in late 2019 after raising <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shape-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$183 million</a> in funding, per Crunchbase data. Aporeto, a machine identity-based micro-segmentation company, sold to Palo Alto Networks for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/palo-alto-networks-acquires-aporeto-for-cloud-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million</a> in cash in 2019 after raising around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aporeto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million</a> from investors, according to Crunchbase. A third portfolio company, a Canadian developer of risk and compliance software called Galvanize, meanwhile sold to corporate governance software maker Diligent for a reported <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/24/insight-partners-diligent-acquire-galvanize-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion</a>. Galvanize had raised around $50 million in funding led by Norwest.</p>
<p>A number of Norwest&#8217;s consumer-facing investments also hit the public market. Two of these went out via SPAC: the real estate company Opendoor, and the digital mental health company Talkspace. A third portfolio company, Udemy, began trading publicly in October after staging a traditional IPO. (Its shares are trading down by roughly one-third of their offering price as of this writing.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Norwest currently operates in the Bay Area but it also has offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, and in India, so it has extensive geographic reach.</p>
<p>The outfit also invests in a wide range of companies. Some of these are life sciences outfits. Some are direct-to-consumer retail plays. Others are fintech startups like Plaid, whose Series C round Norwest joined in 2018, and the consumer finance startup Dave, which expects to close a merger with a blank-check company shortly and to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-finance-startup-dave-eyes-acquisitions-crypto-after-spac-deal-11639391403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin trading publicly </a>in January.</p>
<p>Of this last sector, longtime partner Lisa Wu, who led the Plaid deal, notes that Norwest&#8217;s interest ties exclusively to the upside it sees in such companies. Norwest, she makes clear, is not a strategic investor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wells gives us a competitive advantage, but our relationship with Wells is really an arm&#8217;s length relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have complete investment authority and autonomy over our investment processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area where Norwest notably hasn&#8217;t yet made a deal is in world of crypto. Asked about this, Wu suggests that it&#8217;s just a matter of time. &#8220;We talk about it every day,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We believe in the momentum . . . it&#8217;s coming [now] in Fund XVI.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the many conversations around “the metaverse” sparked by the Facebook corporate name transition to Meta, much has focused on the visual elements. What’s hardly mentioned is audio. Yet voice really matters when making a virtual environment come to life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>Just ask Spike Jonze. The movie director discarded the original voice actor in the title role of his <a href="https://uproxx.com/hitfix/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 film “Her”</a> and substituted Scarlett Johansson’s sultry timbres. Although Samantha, a computer operating system, never appeared in the flesh, Jonze felt the original actress hadn’t nailed the emotion required to create a three-dimensional persona.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Voice was critical to creating a fleshed-out character that could absorb the viewer into the story’s premise and make it fully believable.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/29/facebook-meta-rebrand-metaverse-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> noted, many keystones of the Meta vision of the metaverse already exist in video gaming — only in disconnected gaming worlds. And in the gaming universe, voice is playing an increasingly important role. Meta promises a unified, interoperable experience, but without a rich panoply of highly textured, lifelike digital voices, the metaverse will be incomplete rather than inclusive and immersive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/mcGurk-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McGurk Effect research</a> of the mid-1970s observed the cognitive dissonance resulting from mismatched audio and visual perceptions; voices that don’t fully mesh with an avatar can rip the participant from the virtual environment.</p>
<h2>Expressing the real you</h2>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the metaverse as currently promoted is a social environment where participants create unique personas in both home and workplace settings. Avatars will allow players to express themselves the way they want to be seen — as human, alien, animal, vegetable, cartoon or myriad other options. Players can try on new “looks” temporarily, the way they try new outfits. Gender and species are fluid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Changing identity is hamstrung, however, if people are not able to change how they sound along with their visual presence. Having your voice match the persona presented to other people is a core element of a personalized player identity. It is a situation many people are already accustomed to from video games.</p>
<p>If you encounter a gritty, bearded, hulking knight in a game you are playing, you would expect that character to have a deep, gruff voice, accompanied by the clank of armor. Game companies make sure to deliver this, with non-player characters (NPCs) being carefully crafted by voice actors and audio specialists to provide an immersive experience.</p>
<p>Yet in online gaming environments or in the future metaverse, where the knight is the representation of an actual person, you will have a vastly different experience. You may be startled to hear a high-pitched teenager with bad microphone quality instead of the anticipated gravelly, mature voice. The drastic incongruence between sound and vision shreds the immersive quality of the experience. Metaverse avatars can only be fully immersive if they allow people to create full digital experiences.</p>
<h2>Providing cover</h2>
<p>In addition to enabling immersion, sonic identity technology can also allow players to slip into “true” pseudonymity. They can fully become the person (or being) they want others to see — which for many people is powerful protection from a sometimes hostile online environment. It can disguise a geographical accent so the participant can more smoothly integrate a player community (a capability an offshore customer support call center might benefit from). For people with vocal tics, it can cloak a physical impairment they’d rather not reveal.</p>
<p>Voice changing technology can also help to mitigate online discrimination and harassment. A research study published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-018-9962-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</a> in 2019 notes that female gamers frequently avoid verbal communication with other players to reduce unpleasant interactions. Voice changing technology can allow them to participate in fully pseudonymous conversations, free of a specified gender, in which they might feel more comfortable in expressing themselves.</p>
<p>Regardless of the “why,” researchers in the scholarly journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07370024.2014.987346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human-Computer Interaction</a> concluded in 2014 that “voice radically transforms the experience of online gaming, making virtual spaces more intensely social.”</p>
<p>From my own internal company data, it’s clear that players who communicate with voice alter egos feel more engrossed in the game, engage it for longer periods of time and spend more money within the game as a result.</p>
<h2>What’s missing in the metaverse</h2>
<p>A truly complete immersive experience requires a combination of 3D visuals and real-time audio to enable people to express themselves in the way they want to be heard. Participants want a sonic representation of themselves that is just as original and unique as their visual avatar — and they want the tools to customize their voice as meticulously as their appearance. There must be a harmonious marriage of both augmented audio and 3D video to keep the player immersed and engaged.</p>
<p>Real-time audio defines how people can bring the ultimate individuality to their content, making audio the great equalizer of the metaverse. Unfortunately, the current voice experience is challenged to offer the type of immersive qualities that will live up to the promise of an all-encompassing metaverse.</p>
<p>Real-time audio personas are still restrictive at best, despite experimentation by dogged early adopters. The tools to shape a person&#8217;s voice to match their digital self are limited and sound quality does not yet match visual quality.</p>
<p>Yet recent advancements in available audio technology are making it far easier for players to create a unique sonic identity. New solutions available to platform and game developers enable writers, producers and audio engineers to incorporate voice modification technology within their games to produce natural-sounding and fantasy voices on demand, in real time.</p>
<p>It offers the potential to generate new avenues for monetization by delivering an inclusive and immersive auditory experience that lures players and keeps them fully focused and engaged in the experience rather than dropping away.</p>
<p>Companies are investing in powerful tools that enable people to shape the visual representation of themselves in a digital space. They must not overlook the customized sonic identity for a matching social audio experience that makes the digital representation seamless.</p>
<p>The metaverse won’t be complete without it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Oversight Board, a group Facebook created to review its policy decisions, <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/927673894608838-oversight-board-upholds-meta-s-original-decision-case-2021-014-fb-ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighed in</a> on a case of misinformation in war-torn Ethiopia Tuesday, warning the company about the risks of allowing hate speech and unverified information to spread freely in conflict zones.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board reviewed a post in Amharic from an Ethiopia-based Facebook user that claimed the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was responsible for murder, rape and looting in Raya Kobo and other population centers in the country&#8217;s Amhara region, aided by Tigrayan civilians.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the user claims his sources are previous unnamed reports and people on-the-ground, he does not even provide circumstantial evidence to support his allegations,&#8221; the Oversight Board wrote in its evaluation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Rumors alleging that an ethnic group is complicit in mass atrocities, as found in this post, are dangerous and significantly increase the risk of imminent violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post was initially detected by Facebook&#8217;s automated content moderation tools and removed when the platform&#8217;s Amharic language content review team determined it violated the platform&#8217;s rules against hate speech. Facebook reversed its own decision and reinstated the content after the case was escalated to the Oversight Board.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board overturned Facebook&#8217;s decision to reinstate the post, citing a violation of Facebook&#8217;s rules against violence and incitement rather than the hate speech rules the platform had cited previously. In its decision, the group expressed concern that the spread of unverifiable rumors in violence-stricken areas like Ethiopia could &#8220;lead to grave atrocities, as was the case in Myanmar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The month, a group of Rohingya refugees in the U.S. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/rohingya-lawsuit-against-facebook-wake-up-call-social-media-2021-12-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a $150 billion class-action suit against Meta</a>, alleging that Facebook&#8217;s entrance into the country served as a &#8220;key inflection point&#8221; in the genocide of the Rohingya people. Misinformation stoking ethnic violence in Myanmar spread broadly on Facebook, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often sown by military personnel</a>, and is widely believed to have escalated ethnic violence that targeted and displaced the country&#8217;s Muslim minority.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/facebook-oversight-board-frances-haugen/">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> has cited algorithmically amplified ethnic violence in countries like Myanmar and Ethiopia — and Meta&#8217;s failure to adequately address it — as one of the platform&#8217;s biggest dangers. &#8220;What we saw in Myanmar and are now seeing in Ethiopia are only the opening chapters of a story so terrifying, no one wants to read the end of it,” Haugen told Congress in October.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board also instructed Meta to order an independent human rights assessment on Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s role in exacerbating the risk of ethnic violence in Ethiopia and to evaluate how well it can moderate content in the country&#8217;s languages.</p>
<p>Last month, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-ethiopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended</a> the safety precautions it had taken in the country, highlighting expanded applications of some of its rules against misinformation and hate speech. The company also noted that it had improved its enforcement abilities there in the past two years and now has the capability to review content in Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya, the four most common languages.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Tuesday, December 14! Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/what-to-expect-today-day-one-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">Space event is underway and kicking maximum Q thus far</a>, I am happy to report. In other TechCrunch news, I just hit my two-year mark being back at the blog. Time flies! Thanks to everyone for reading my rambling so that I can stay aboard the good ship TechCrunch. Now, the news! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-launches-its-siri-only-apple-music-voice-plan-with-ios-15-2/">Apple’s Siri-only music plan launches:</a></strong> I had forgotten all about Apple’s cheaper, more limited music plan announced earlier this year. But it’s not only real, it’s here. So, if you are big into Apple speaker tech and want to save a few bucks, here’s a music streaming option for you. Notably, part of the innovation is a lower price, which, frankly, given streaming economics, is not the direction I want to see music services go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/metaverse-startup-with-1m-in-2021-revenues-going-public-via-spac/"><strong>This may be peak SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>To cap 2021’s more silly stories off with a cherry, a metaverse-themed company with around $1 million in revenue is going public via a SPAC. Naturally, it has big expectations for future revenue growth. The company is betting that public-market investors are sufficiently smitten with all things metaverse to bid up its equity. Let’s see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/big-cartel-staff-are-voluntarily-recognized-as-the-latest-tech-workers-union/"><strong>Big Cartel unionizes:</strong></a> In the wake of news <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/12/amazon-worker-texted-girlfriend-he-wasnt-allowed-to-leave-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Amazon workers died in their facility after a tornado hit it</a>, you might be curious about the progress of unionization among workers for tech companies. Slowly, is the answer to that. But startups are taking the lead again, with Big Cartel choosing to voluntarily recognize its employee union. Confused? Yes, leadership has been scarce in this area from the corporate perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off today, here’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/gift-guide-5-gifts-for-all-of-us-who-need-less-screen-time/">guide from our own Sarah Perez concerning what gifts to buy</a> if you are looking to cut your, or your loved one’s, screen time. I need this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/garner-health-raises-45m-series-b-for-totally-objective-doctor-review-service/">How many stars does your doctor have?</a> </strong>Garner Health is betting that you want to look up doctor reviews before picking your provider. The company’s work landed a $45 million Series B, TechCrunch reports. Given just how big the healthcare market is, the company’s TAM is effectively infinite.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/in-the-age-of-remote-work-opal-offers-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-webcams/"><strong>The new webcam status symbol:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Everyone’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sp990/status/1470857694823079936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about Opal</a>, at least on my Twitter feed. The company built a $300 webcam that looks nifty, and, we presume, will actually be in stock. This deep into the pandemic, lots of folks still have spotty internet, poor lighting and more. Perhaps the startup didn’t miss its window.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/andreessen-horowitz-backs-nft-investor-group-behind-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-purchase/"><strong>a16z backs PleasrDAO:</strong></a> The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) PleasrDAO has collected backing from a16z, which TechCrunch notes is not the first time that the investing group has backed a DAO. Pleasr’s claims to fame appear to be that it bought a doge NFT for $4 million and spent millions more on a Wu-Tang Clan album.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pair-eyewear-focuses-in-on-adult-glasses-as-it-takes-in-60m/"><strong>Pair raises $60M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While we’re sufficiently far past the Warby Parker founding story now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly/">that the company is public</a>, startups aren’t letting the eyeglasses game rest. Pair, which builds eyewear that allows for inexpensive modification, just closed its second round of the year. Previously, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/pair-eyewear-raises-12m-to-bring-more-personality-to-your-glasses/">raised $12 million in April</a>. A quick perusal of its service while writing this newsletter for you left me wanting a pair, for whatever my limited fashion sense is worth. It’s worth noting that Warby Parker remains above its $40 per-share IPO price. More on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">the Warby DTC IPO from earlier this year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/in-person-event-sound-streaming-service-mixhalo-raises-24m/"><strong>Mixhalo raises Series B for live audio mixing:</strong></a> The live events business may have been little more than moribund during the last few years, but Mixhalo is far from dead, it turns out. The company, focused on live audio for, well, live events just closed a Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/carto-raises-61-million-to-help-you-visualize-data-on-maps/"><strong>Mapping data is big business:</strong></a> If you go back into the depths of startup time, there was once this big moment for “mashups.” The idea was to take two data sets and smush them together. This led to sites like Mashable — get it? — being formed. The mashup movement wound up subsumed into other tech work. Or was it? Carto just raised a $61 million Series C for what TechCrunch describes as helping companies display “data on interactive maps so that you can more easily compare, optimize, balance and make decisions.” Maps plus data? Sounds like a mashup.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/mesh-payments-racks-up-50m-to-help-corporate-users-manage-spend-and-payments/">Today’s Tiger round is Mesh Payments:</a> </strong>Helping companies manage their spend is a simply huge startup category. Ramp, Brex, Airbase and others are working on the issue in the United States, for example. International competitors abound as well. Today TechCrunch noted that Mesh Payments, another player in the space, just raised a $50 million round led by the ever-present Tiger.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/weather-focused-ibisa-raises-seed-round-to-back-its-microinsurance-solutions-for-low-income-small-farmers/"><strong>Luxembourg-based IBISA raises microround for microinsurance:</strong></a> I dig this one. Focused on providing coverage for “small farmers whose livelihoods might be affected by adverse climate events,” IBISA just raised about $1.7 million in a new capital round. The company, despite its European roots, focuses on developing markets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/fresha-a-business-platform-for-salons-spas-and-beauty-and-wellness-pros-extends-series-c-by-52-5m-at-a-640m-valuation/"><strong>Vertical SaaS remains an investable category:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the wake of Squire raising successive rounds for its barbershop vertical SaaS play, we should not be shocked that Fresha has raised a $52.5 million round of capital today. The company sells software for the beauty and wellness industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as we segue into today’s TechCrunch+ feature story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/"><strong>our own Ron Miller is not as convinced as some about the web3 hype</strong></a>. Others are more excited:</p>
<h2>7 investors discuss web3’s present and peer into its future</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re years away from web3 capturing major market share, and there are valid concerns that its complexity will daunt consumers and regulators. </span></p>

It has never given up on its slight angle on the social world, and its parent company has not been shy in using its capital resources — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/snap-looks-to-raise-1-billion-in-private-debt-offering/">the company raised debt some years ago</a> — to keep the platform well stocked.

Why? Because there are only so many people with enough money and internet access out there for Netflix to sell streaming services to. Evidence of the company starting to bump up against its natural market size is that the American streaming service is cutting prices in India. As our own Manish Singh notes, this is not the first time that the company has tinkered with its pricing in the country.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All good things come to those who wait, and Porsche has reserved the most powerful version of its all-electric Taycan for last: the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and the wagon-style Taycan GTS Sport Turismo.</p>
<p>For those who want power, refined and sporty driving, and the ability to forgo gasoline for an all-electric powertrain, the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo both offer a solid blend of high-tech and powerful performance, which TechCrunch had a chance to test recently. GTS now comes in every model line Porsche offers, and the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo round out a total of 10 different Porsche Taycan offerings.</p>
<p>The upshot: The Sport Turismo GTS and its sedan sibling should be the benchmark for any luxury automaker trying to attract customers who want to make the transition from internal combustion to all-electric as smooth, seamless and reliable as possible. The drawback of course is that being a luxury vehicle puts the Taycan — and its many variants — out of reach for most people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246933" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before Porsche purists sharpen their knives about how the Taycan and its variants aren&#8217;t &#8220;true Porsches,&#8221; they might consider how the EV has resonated with consumers. The electric vehicle, first announced in 2019, has been a tremendous sales success for the company. Porsche <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increase-deliveries-quarter-3-2021-26063.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold 28,640 Taycan vehicles</a> in the January-to-September period of 2021, outselling its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/porsches-all-electric-taycan-outsells-its-flagship-911-sports-car/">flagship 911 sports car</a> as well as the Panamera, 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman vehicles. (Porsche&#8217;s two most popular vehicles, the Cayenne and Macan, still outpaced the Taycan in sales.)</p>
<p>While the Taycan doesn&#8217;t come close to the number of Tesla Model 3 and Y sales reported this year, it has, so far, outstripped Tesla&#8217;s Model S and X sales. Tesla reports show that the company has delivered 13,214 Model S and Xs <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update.pdf%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the end of the third quarter</a>.</p>
<p>The sales numbers suggest that Porsche&#8217;s $1 billion investment in the development of the Taycan have paid off. My time in these two latest and last variants verify that those development dollars were well spent. The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo are a sports sedan and wagon to be reckoned with.</p>
<h2>On the road with the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</h2>
<p>Porsche unveiled the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo GTS</a> at an event prior to the LA Auto show a few weeks ago, and we got seat time in both vehicles just after the unveiling in and around the Los Angeles area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo sit below the line-topping 670-horsepower Turbo variant. Porsche says that Taycan GTS can accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds thanks to its 590-horsepower and 626 pound-ft of torque coming from a pair of permanent magnet synchronous motors at the front and rear of the car. That means that both variants of the GTS are all-wheel drive, though during normal driving, the balance of power is pushed down through the rear wheels.</p>
<p>That rear motor comes from the Porsche Taycan Turbo, and Porsche says that this makes the GTS more agile and responsive on the road.</p>
<p>The motors are powered by a 93.4 kWh battery pack on 800-volt architecture, in both vehicles. That allows the vehicle to fast charge from 5% battery power up to 80% in just 22 minutes, which we got to try out at a DC fast charger in a local Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>I drove a bright red Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from downtown Los Angeles to Willow Springs (a one-way trip of around 90 miles) and back across the winding Angeles Crest Highway and Lake Hughes Road and back to downtown.</p>
<p>The heavier wagon-style GTS Sport Turismo never belied that it had that big ol&#8217; backside hanging out. Agile, responsive, and comfortable in the variety of modes that ranged from the electron-sipping Range setting to Normal, Sport, Sport + and Individual, the GTS Sport Turismo is a luxurious and mighty powerful electric wagon.</p>

<p>Whether making a pass on a two-lane highway near Willow Springs or winding it over the sun-beaten concrete on the Crest, the GTS Sport Turismo lives up to its Porsche-touted moniker as the &#8220;sweet spot,&#8221; between the lower 4S and the top-of-the-line Turbo &#8212; and it&#8217;s specifically geared for those who want a sports car feel in an all-electric people hauler.</p>
<p>Porsche recalibrated the Porsche Active Suspension Management System, retuned the chassis, added an optional rear-steering system and adaptive anti-roll bars in the car we drove. In addition to this, the Taycan GTS and its wagon-y cousin get a new, optional, trick sunroof that goes from opaque to various stages of staggered panels, to clear, with the touch of a button. The roof is actually made of two panes of glass with liquid crystal nestled between, which creates a UV-blocking grey panel when fully activated or closed.</p>
<h2>At the track with the Porsche Taycan GTS</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2247005" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247005" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2247005 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg" alt="porsche taycan gts electric vehicle willow springs" width="1600" height="812" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=1536,780 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2247005" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Bassett</p></div></p>
<p>More than likely, most Taycan GTS buyers won&#8217;t ever track their sedan, but, for that very small handful of people who do, there&#8217;s plenty to be impressed with. The Taycan GTS sedan still offers ample room for four passengers and all the bells and whistles of the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, without the hatchback styling. Instead of hauling a wagon around the track at Big Willow, which honestly, sounds like a blast, I climbed into a Taycan GTS sedan for a 30-minute lead-follow stint.</p>
<p>The Taycan GTS comes with Porsche&#8217;s Track Precision app, which integrates with the new PCM 6.0 system in the car. Connect the app on your phone to the car and you can get detailed, real-time data on speeds, braking force, accelerator and brake input, and other information about just how you&#8217;re driving on the track. Mount your phone on your windshield and you&#8217;ll get the added bonus of a first-person POV video of the track that the app maps to everything from throttle input to steering angle and brake pressure.</p>
<p>Willow Springs is a notoriously gnarly track both because of its age and its sans-landmark, off-camber turns. On the track, the Taycan GTS remained firmly planted as I rocketed up to 120 mph on the front straight. Larger front brakes on the Taycan GTS (the same on the Sport Turismo) helped quickly haul the electric sedan down to more manageable speeds for the series of turns that run up the hill to a blind but sweeping left-hand turn and the vehicle felt connected and precise.</p>
<p>To say that the Taycan GTS is quick is an understatement. I drove Big Willow for the first time in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/lamborghini-huracan-sto-a-final-celebration-before-electrification/">Lamborghini Huracán STO</a> back in September. I don&#8217;t proclaim to be a race car driver, but, for context, my Porsche app-recorded lap time in the Taycan GTS sedan was only four seconds off of my best time in the STO &#8212; and that vehicle is specifically made for the race track. Suffice it to say, the Taycan GTS hauls on a closed course.</p>
<h2>Charging the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</h2>

<p>Once our track time was over, I climbed back into the GTS Sport Turismo for the slog back to downtown Los Angeles. When I set out from the hotel that foggy Saturday morning, I started out with a fully charged battery and a range of 235 miles.</p>
<p>By the time we got to Willow Springs, after some spirited highway and canyon driving, the vehicle had around 130 miles of range left. The route was around 90 miles in total (one way) and I spent most of the drive toggling the wheel on the Race-Tex wrapped steering wheel, between Range, Sport + and Individual settings. These settings adjust the suspension, power and steering feel, and even the synthetic &#8220;engine sound&#8221; you hear on the Taycan GTS. The Individual setting, where I could separately set the steering feel and the ride to my liking, was my favorite.</p>
<p>Los Angeles traffic is perpetual, which can pose a challenge for some electric vehicles and their range. I stopped at a Porsche-appointed stopover to charge the Taycan GTS at one of the public Electrify America chargers in Burbank with around 70 miles of range left.</p>
<p>On a Saturday night, the place was absolutely packed with shoppers and EV chargers alike. There was only one DC fast charger, and according to the Porsche rep manning the charger to help journalists plug in, it had been out of service almost all day. When I arrived a Ford Mustang Mach-E was charging at the spot, so I pulled into one of the others that were vacant. To no EV owner&#8217;s surprise, the charger wouldn&#8217;t initiate for my GTS Sport Turismo. I tried three other chargers in the row, before finally returning to the DC fast charger, which, miraculously, connected and quickly charged my Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from 25% to 80% in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>While this was a problem specific to the Electrify America charger, not Porsche, it is indirectly a problem for any automaker counting on this network of DC fast chargers to help it compete with Tesla and its proprietary Supercharger network. The Electrify America chargers at that location continually failed to recognize the vehicle I was driving. When other journalists showed up to charge, they too, had a similar issue and we all got to play charger leapfrog with a handful of electric motorcycles and cars to find a charger that would work.</p>
<h2>User experience</h2>
<p>While the charging infrastructure still needs a lot of work, the good news is that Porsche has made locating those chargers in its navigation system far easier than other electric automakers (with the exception of Tesla).</p>
<p>There are three different ways to find available chargers in the system. You can use the capable voice recognition to ask for local chargers, which will then pop up on the navigation system for you choose. You can also use the touchscreen to set search parameters (including the brand of EV charger and speed of charge) to search for chargers nearby.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the Porsche app or the navigation in the infotainment system to set a route and the system will automatically find chargers along the route based on how much charge you want to have left when you arrive at your destination. The vehicles I drove were European-spec so I wasn&#8217;t able to try this setup myself, but one of the sedans at the track had some limited U.S-features available and a Porsche spokesperson walked me through the process.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to access these features via the center screen, Porsche&#8217;s new infotainment screen stretches across to the passenger side of the car and allows passengers to search for chargers, change stereo inputs and stations, and navigate (amongst other things) while the vehicle is under way. Most automakers lock out access to these features in their vehicles both from the driver and passenger seats when they&#8217;re moving, a &#8220;feature,&#8221; that&#8217;s absolutely infuriating when actively trying to navigate or find locations while moving. It&#8217;s not so in the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, since both the driver and passenger can still interact with numerous features on the infotainment system while the vehicle is rolling.</p>
<p>The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo will be delivered to customers willing to shell out for the $110,000+ price tag by Q2 of 2022. Pricing starts at $131,400 (plus $1,350 for delivery) for the sedan and $133,300 for the Sport Turismo. And in true Porsche style, nearly everything can be customized to your liking. Both offer plenty of performance and style for the proverbial buck in sleek, sleeper packaging that offers a solid balance of technology and refinement for the enthusiast and their passengers.</p>
<p>The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS, in any form, is truly an electric vehicle to be reckoned with.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most people have experienced the internet only through Web 2.0. Online applications, the social web and software as a service form the fabric of our lives.</p>
<p>Lately, many have championed web3 as the internet’s next phase, but the term encompasses so much territory, conversations can be diffuse and there are valid concerns that its complexity will daunt consumers and regulators.</p>
<p>However, our research indicated that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/7-investors-discuss-web3s-present-and-peer-into-its-future/">the web3 investment landscape is growing increasingly competitive</a> as venture capitalists become more educated.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>To get a clearer sense of where the market is, we reached out to several active investors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block</li>
<li>Atul Ajoy, partner, Horseshoe Capital</li>
<li>David Chreng-Messembourg, founding partner, LeadBlock Partners</li>
<li>Randy Glein, founder/partner, and Sam Shapiro, principal, DFJ Growth</li>
<li>Mercedes Bent, partner, Lightspeed Venture Partners</li>
<li>Jai Das, co-founder, president and partner, Sapphire Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things as clear as possible, we asked each respondent to share their elevator pitch: How would they describe the technology if they were trying to convince a skeptic to invest?</p>
<p>Starting with the potential consumer appeal of cartoon apes, we tried to find out what attracted them to invest in the semantic web and where they’re currently seeing demand. Notably, several said they started exploring the space after developing an interest in crypto.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing potential use cases for advertising, fintech and enterprise apps, respondents shared advice for web3 founders who are hunting for funding, along with their concerns about factors that could stall its development.</p>
<p>Finally, we asked each respondent: What are the skeptics missing?</p>
<p>“I never met a skeptical investor who actually understood what was going on. If you get it, you’re probably strapped in and ready to go,” said Lior Messika, founder and managing partner, Eden Block.</p>

<h2>Conversational UX: The missing piece in your chatbot strategy</h2>

<p>We don’t run many TechCrunch+ articles that are focused on basic best practices, but we make exceptions for posts about emerging technology — in this case, conversational UX.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s notoriously difficult for software to mimic human conversation. Many chatbots are so inept, it makes one long for the days of &#8220;press 0 for an operator.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging,” writes Raghu Ravinutala, CEO and co-founder of Yellow.ai, a conversational CX platform.</p>

<p>As we edge closer to the end of the year, we&#8217;re running more articles that look back at some of the trends we covered in 2021, along with a few that offer well-informed predictions for 2022.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Alex Wilhelm looked back at &#8220;insane IPO pops&#8221; for companies like DoorDash, C3.ai, Roblox, Coinbase and others to see whether these debuts were a reflection of &#8220;early exuberance,&#8221; inflated expectations, or possibly, the fact &#8220;that no one knows how to price IPOs during chaotic market moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; is a fixed spot on a map, but it&#8217;s also a figure of speech, like &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; or &#8220;The White House.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors are no longer fixated on the Bay Area, and neither are founders. That’s a truth that’s been in the making for a while, but now, it’s changing how we cover startups.</p>
<p>The Equity team discussed the trend in a TechCrunch+ post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: Funding data doesn’t matter the way it used to.</li>
<li>Mary Ann Azevedo: The decentralization of startups isn’t new, even if it is accelerating.</li>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: The declining impact of aggregated startup funding data is good news.</li>

<p>Presales is an integral but less discussed aspect of the sales funnel for many tech companies. But the C-suite often tries to pump sales head counts to drive growth.</p>
<p>Presales provides tech firms another avenue, writes Freddy Jose Mangum, CEO and co-founder of Hub. Thanks to their natural technical bent, optimizing the productivity of presales executives can lead to multiplicative growth.</p>
<p>Mangum illustrates the potential of presales with three scenarios while outlining ways leaders can help executives increase their productivity.</p>

<p>The EU’s value added tax reform for e-commerce has significant implications for marketplaces, and companies like Amazon may be liable for hefty tax fines if they don’t comply with the new regulations, writes Roger Gothmann, co-founder and CEO at Taxdoo.</p>
<p>The reform mandates that marketplaces must determine the VAT due for every transaction made on their platform, and establish related processes.</p>
<p>Filing VAT is also more complex now, as different countries have their own local VAT procedures alongside the new ones introduced by the reform.</p>
<p>Gothmann takes us on a deep dive of the VAT reform and the financial and legal risks e-commerce marketplaces face if they don’t hurry up to comply with the new laws.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-sexual-harassment-suit-185934119.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1"><ins>Jessica Barraza’s lawsuit last month</ins></a>, six more current and former female employees have come forward to accuse Tesla of fostering a culture of rampant sexual harassment at its Fremont factory in California. In separate complaints filed on Tuesday with the Superior Court in Alameda County, the women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, physical contact and discrimination while at work.</p>
<p>Jessica Brooks, one of the women who sued Tesla, alleges she was harassed on her first day of orientation at the automaker. She claims a supervisor told his male subordinates to “check out the new girl.” Brooks says the harassment was so constant she eventually stacked boxes around her workstation to deter her coworkers from whistling at her. Brooks also claims she complained of the situation to Tesla’s HR department. The company allegedly responded by moving Brooks to a different part of the factory instead of addressing the situation directly.</p>
<p>“I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,” Brooks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Washington </ins></em><ins>Post</ins></a>. “That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When Jessica Barraza sued Tesla last month, she said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions at the company’s Fremont plant. Barraza’s lawsuit described a factory floor that looked more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of one of the most advanced EV makers in the country. Most of the seven women who have sued Tesla have linked the abuse they experienced to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. “He would make 69 or 420 jokes … which caused the technicians to be even worse,” said one of the complaints.</p>
<p>The suit comes on the same day five former SpaceX employees accused Musk’s other company of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sexual-harassment-claims-204712046.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><ins>doing little to stop sexual harassment</ins></a>. We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment. The automaker does not operate a public relations department. When a federal court recently ordered Tesla to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>pay $137 million</ins></a> to a Black worker who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at the company’s Fremont factory, the company said: “We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns. Occasionally, we’ll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Much has been written about the long-term impact COVID-19 will have on how people do their jobs. Throughout the pandemic, people had the space and time to consider what really matters to them, and to ask the big questions such as “Am I happy?”</p>
<p>For many people, the crisis has acted as a catalyst for change, leading to the Great Resignation, or the Great Talent Swap for those that lost employees to a competitor or different company. Life goals people perhaps once only daydreamed about are now becoming a reality with the plethora of options and flexibility now available.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.workhuman.com/resources/globoforce-blog/introducing-the-new-workhuman-survey-report-the-great-resignation?utm_source=trdparty&amp;utm_medium=prbyline&amp;utm_campaign=2021Q4_PR_Corporate&amp;utm_content=ExecutiveContent_post_byline_121021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> at Workhuman bears this out: 30% of people looking for a new job say they are doing so for greater flexibility, and it seems that parents are particularly motivated to change, accounting for 65% of the total of job seekers. Clearly, many workers are looking for ways to better manage family and work responsibilities.</p>
<p>For instance, research we conducted for our Human Workplace Index revealed that 56% of respondents who want to stay at their company say it’s because they like their company and/or co-workers. Culture is therefore key to winning and retaining workers.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that businesses and leaders need to act. The Great Resignation has created an employee market where people have a wealth of openings available to them and they can be more selective about who they work for. Employers therefore need to give current employees a reason to stay and prospective employees a reason to apply.</p>
<p>Building a strong employer brand is now mission critical. Companies that fail to do so risk stifling their own growth for a want of talent, as this voluntary turnover could cost businesses around the world billions of dollars.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given today’s labor market, ensuring that the employee experience is frictionless, rewarding and based on a culture of reward and recognition is more important than ever. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are three areas where businesses can leverage data-driven techniques to drive employee satisfaction:</p>
<h2>Human-centered technology</h2>
<p>Traditionally, HR technology has been transactional and focused on the task. The technology needed right now focuses on the people just as much as it does on their experience of the task being done.</p>
<p>Human-centered technology that powers actions such as continuous feedback, employee recognition, celebrating individual and team accomplishments, and building a more human workplace have measurable bottom-line benefits because they strengthen employees’ emotional ties to each other and the organization.</p>
<p>One approach could be to set up a peer-to-peer recognition platform where people can publicly recognize the work of their colleagues. The platform could potentially link to a rewards program whereby employees gain points toward goods or experiences. From an analytics perspective, the approach also provides valuable data on where good work is being done in the organization and by whom, enabling employers to identify high performers and ensure that they are adequately engaged at work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting today, Twitter is rolling out auto-generated captions on videos. This feature will make videos more accessible for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. Auto captions will be available on web, iOS and Android in over 30 languages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and many more.</p>
<p>The captions could become useful in Twitter&#8217;s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/twitter-is-the-latest-platform-to-test-a-tiktok-copycat-feature/">vertical feed</a> the company began testing last week. The feed, if rolled out publicly, would make the app&#8217;s Explore tab resemble TikTok, serving one piece of algorithmically recommended content at a time, including videos. On feeds like this, captioned videos have become expected because they make it easier to scroll through feeds when you&#8217;re in a public place and headphones aren&#8217;t in reach.</p>
<p>But unlike the video caption features on TikTok and Instagram Reels &#8212; which allow users to edit the captions&#8217; text before posting &#8212; Twitter won&#8217;t let users tweak its captions. That means users won&#8217;t be able to correct any errors to make the automated captions more accurate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Accessibility features like auto captions and image alt text have been getting more attention from Twitter after it finally created dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/#:~:text=Somehow%2C%20Twitter%20does%20not%20have%20a%20team%20dedicated%20to%20accessibility,-Devin%20Coldewey%40techcrunch&amp;text=Twitter%20does%20not%20have%20a%20team%20dedicated%20to%20accessibility%2C%20the,about%20doing%20the%20right%20thing.">accessibility teams</a> in September 2020. This staffing change was spurred after users <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> Twitter last summer for piloting a voice tweet feature without auto captions. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415806764113670145?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice tweets</a> and Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse competitor, both have <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-spaces-accessible" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captioning</a>.</p>
<p>While Twitter&#8217;s support for captions on videos is new, the company was already using captioning technology in its live audio chatrooms, called Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>The company notes it retains an audio copy of a Space, including the captions, for thirty days to review the content for violations of Twitter&#8217;s guidelines. If a Space is found to contain a violation, Twitter will hold on to these records for an additional 90 days to offer the speakers a chance to appeal their violation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately for Twitter and users alike, this process doesn&#8217;t go far enough to address issues of abuse on its platform. Twitter Spaces users have been served <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blatantly harmful content</a> &#8212; including Spaces with racist titles that remained on their feeds even after being reported. Twitter community manager Simon Balmain recently <a href="https://twitter.com/SBkcrn/status/1465659201800347651" target="_blank" rel="noopener" rev="en_rl_none">tweeted</a> the company is working on the problem, but Twitter hasn&#8217;t yet detailed if or how its system will expand beyond its existing reporting features and the retention of Spaces&#8217; audio and captions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Proterra, an American commercial electric vehicle company that produces transit buses and electric charging systems, is opening up its third battery factory in Greer, South Carolina. The factory should begin production in the second half of 2022 with &#8220;multiple gigawatt hours of annual battery system production capacity,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>Proterra did not disclose the specific production capacity expected at its South Carolina plant, but its two other plants in Burlingame, California and Los Angeles have a max annual capacity of 345 megawatt hours and 675 megawatt hours, respectively, according to Shane Levy, director of corporate communications.</p>
<p>Globally, the electric commercial vehicle market is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/07/05/2257591/0/en/Global-Electric-Commercial-Vehicle-Market-is-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-17-3-from-2021-to-2030.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to reach $62.4 billion this year</a>. With myriad government and corporate initiatives focused on decreasing emissions, the commercial EV sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% over the next nine years, and automakers are racing to supply that demand. In January this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">General Motors announced its new commercial electric vehicle brand, Brightdrop</a>, and in September,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/ford-builds-leadership-team-of-commercial-vehicle-unit-ahead-of-e-transit-launch/"> Ford beefed up its commercial EV</a> unit ahead of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/ford-unveils-e-transit-its-45000-electric-workhorse/">Ford E-Transit work van</a> launch, to name a couple.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With this new plant, Proterra has committed to creating more than 200 jobs in South Carolina and investing a minimum of $76 million into the 327,000-square-foot plant, which is located at the 42.76-acre Carolina Commerce Center. The factory, which is located near the company&#8217;s electric bus manufacturing facility, is Proterra&#8217;s entry into producing batteries in the eastern U.S., which the company says will bring it closer to its &#8220;Proterra Powered&#8221; customers. In addition to building its own electric vehicles, Proterra partners with other automakers to integrate its powertrains into their vehicles. Daimler&#8217;s Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley school bus from Thomas Built Buses, for example, is powered by Proterra, as are Volta&#8217;s new refrigerated trucks.</p>

<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>The Greer battery production site comes a year after Proterra opened its second battery factory within its existing EV bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles. It will also be neighbors to commercial EV competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/ev-maker-arrival-to-build-high-voltage-battery-module-assembly-plant-in-north-carolina/">Arrival, which recently shared plans to open its own battery module assembly plant</a> in North Carolina. As more automakers begin producing EVs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">wanting to control their own supply chain</a>, more domestic battery assembly plants are sure to follow.</p>
