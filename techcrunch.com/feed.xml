										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer communication platform <a href="https://front.com">Front</a> is holding an event today to introduce three new features. These new features focus on showing you more information about your customers right from Front’s user interface.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Front, the company started as a shared email inbox product so that you can interact with incoming emails as a team. For instance, if your company uses email lists, such as support@companyname.com, sales@companyname.com or jobs@companyname.com, multiple team members can see incoming emails in Front.</p>
<p>Before replying, you can triage conversations by assigning them to specific team members, discuss the current conversation in the comment section or show your email draft before sending it.</p>
<p>Over time, Front has evolved to integrate more communication channels. You can now use Front for SMS conversations, live chat on your website with your customers, Facebook messages, etc. The company has also refined its product with more powerful features.</p>
<p>For instance, you can set up rules to automate your workflow with simple ‘if this then that’ rules. It’s a good way to spread out work across multiple team members and make sure the right person sees the incoming message as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Today, the company is showcasing features that will be particularly useful for teams that interact with bigger customers, such as sales, support and customer success teams. First, Front users will be able to learn more about the customer they’re interacting with directly from their inbox.</p>
<p>The refreshed context panel works better if the team is interacting with multiple people working for your client. Instead of viewing past conversations with someone in particular, you can view past conversations with everyone working for this client.</p>
<p>Front already integrates with your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. You can now more easily pull data into the context panel. You can see the name of the account owner, the customer segment and the SLA (service-level agreement) commitment with this customer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203128" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203128" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png" alt="" width="1024" height="704" class="size-full wp-image-2203128" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=768,528 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=1536,1056 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9-Accounts-Contacts-0_00_24_00.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203128" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Front</p></div></p>
<p>Second, Front is adding new capabilities for its automated routing feature with deeper integrations with your CRM. For instance, you can find the name of the account owner in your CRM and assign incoming emails to the account owner directly.</p>
<p>If the account owner changes in Salesforce, rules will be automatically updated in Front. You can also fetch annual revenue data from your CRM and set a VIP tag if you’re receiving a message from an important customer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203129" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203129" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png" alt="" width="1024" height="704" class="size-full wp-image-2203129" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=768,528 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=1536,1056 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Account-Rules-0_00_24_20.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203129" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Front</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Front will soon upgrade the analytics pages. For instance, you can track the team’s performance for a specific account and compare that to the SLA.</p>
<p>These updates position Front as a tool that works better for bigger enterprise clients with expensive B2B contracts. Current Front customers include Shopify, Dropbox, Flexport, Checkout.com, Lydia and Airbnb.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an Extra Crunch summer. We&#8217;ve heard how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">craft your pitch deck around the one thing that really hooks an investor</a>, and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">the industry experience of Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong ticked every box for Emergence</a> when raising her Series A. And that&#8217;s just the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also gotten a sneak peek at the Disrupt Startup Alley companies in our summer episodes of Extra Crunch Live: Startup Alley Edition.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more where that came from this fall. Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.</p>
<p>So, let me try that again.</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Nicole Quinn (Lightspeed Venture Partners) + Vlad Novakovski (Lunchclub)</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> is further nudging users away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/password/">passwords</a> by rolling out passwordless sign-in options to all consumer Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>The tech giant, like many others in the industry, has waged a war against traditional password-based authentication for some time. This is because passwords are a prime target for cyberattacks, since weak or reused passwords can be guessed or brute-forced through automated attacks.</p>
<p>To that end, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/windows-11-launches-october-5/">and as it gears up to launch Windows 11 in just a few weeks time</a>, Microsoft is rolling out its passwordless sign-in option, previously available only to commercial customers, to all Microsoft accounts. This means that users will be able to sign in to services, such as Outlook and OneDrive, without having to use a password. Instead, users can use the Microsoft Authenticator app, Windows Hello, a security key, and SMS or emailed codes.</p>
<p>Some Microsoft apps will still continue to require a password, however, including Office 2010 or earlier, Remote Desktop and Xbox 360. Similarly, those using now-unsupported versions of Windows won&#8217;t be able to ditch their passwords just yet either, as the feature will only be supported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/windows-10/">Windows 10</a> and Windows 11.</p>
<p>Microsoft says that passwordless sign-in will be rolled out to consumer accounts over the coming weeks, so you might not be able to get rid of your password just yet. It added that it’s also working on a way to eliminate passwords for Azure AD accounts, with admins set to be able to choose whether passwords are required, allowed, or don&#8217;t exist for specific users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.smartnews.com/en/">SmartNews</a>, a Tokyo-headquartered news aggregation website and app that&#8217;s grown in popularity despite hefty competition from built-in aggregators like Apple News, today announced it has closed on $230 million in Series F funding. The round brings SmartNews&#8217; total raise to date to over $400 million and values the business at $2 billion &#8212; or as the company touts<a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/2021/09/15/smartnews-raises-230-million-in-series-f-funding-at-a-2-billion-valuation-plans-to-invest-in-u-s-growth/"> in its press release</a>, a &#8220;double unicorn.&#8221; (Ha!)</p>
<p>The funding included new U.S. investors Princeville Capital and Woodline Partners, as well as JIC Venture Growth Investments, Green Co-Invest Investment, and Yamauchi-No.10 Family Office in Japan. Existing investors participating in this round included ACA Investments and SMBC Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012 in Japan, the company launched to the U.S. in 2014 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities/">expanded its local news footprint </a>early last year. While the app&#8217;s content team includes former journalists, machine learning is used to pick which articles are shown to readers to personalize their experience. However, one of the app&#8217;s key differentiators is how it works to pop users&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>&#8221; through its &#8220;News From All Sides&#8221; feature, which allows its users to access news from across a range of political perspectives.</p>
<p>It has also developed new products, like its Covid-19 vaccine dashboard and U.S. election dashboard, that provide critical information at a glance. With the additional funds, the company says it plans to develop more features for its U.S. audience &#8212; one of its largest, in addition to Japan &#8212;  that will focus on consumer health and safety. These will roll out in the next few months and will include features for tracking wildfires and crime and safety reports. It also recently launched a hurricane tracker.</p>
<p>The aggregator&#8217;s business model is largely focused on advertising, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/smartnews-funding/">the company has said before</a> that 85-80% of Americans aren&#8217;t paying to subscribe to news. But SmartNews&#8217; belief is that these news consumers still have a right to access quality information.</p>
<p>In total, SmartNews has relationships with over 3,000 global publishing partners whose content is available through its service on the web and mobile devices.</p>
<p>To generate revenue, the company sells inline ads and video ads, where revenue is shared with publishers. Over 75% of its publishing partners also take advantage of its &#8220;<a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/2016/07/29/introducing-smartview-first-read-more-faster/">SmartView</a>&#8221; feature. This is the app&#8217;s quick-reading mode, and alternative to something like Google AMP. Here, users can quickly load an article to read, even if they&#8217;re offline. The company <a href="https://about.smartnews.com/en/publishers/">promises publishers</a> that these mobile-friendly stories, which are marked with a lightning bolt icon in the app, deliver higher engagement &#8212; and its algorithm rewards that type of content, bringing them more readers. Among SmartView partners are well-known brands like USA Today, ABC, HuffPost, and others. Currently, over 70% of all SmartNews&#8217; pageviews are coming from SmartView first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SmartNews&#8217; app has proven to be very sticky, in terms of attracting and keeping users&#8217; attention. The company tells us, citing App Annie July 2021 data, that it sees an average time spent per user per month on U.S. mobile devices that&#8217;s higher than Google News or Apple News combined.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203126" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203126" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png 1576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=1536,754 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/smartnews.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie data provided by SmartNews</p></div></p>
<p>The company declined to share its monthly active users (MAUs), but had said in 2019 it had grown to 20 million in the U.S. and Japan. Today, it says its U.S. MAUs doubled over the last year.</p>
<p>According to data provided to us by <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>, the SmartNews app has seen around 85 million downloads since its October 2014 launch, and 14 million of those took place in the past 365 days. Japan is the largest market for installs, accounting for 59% of lifetime downloads, the firm noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This latest round of funding further affirms the strength of our mission, and fuels our drive to expand our presence and launch features that specifically appeal to users and publishers in the United States,&#8221; said SmartNews co-founder and CEO Ken Suzuki. &#8220;Our investors both in the U.S. and globally acknowledge the tremendous growth potential and value of SmartNews’s efforts to democratize access to information and create an ecosystem that benefits consumers, publishers, and advertisers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The company says the new funds will be used to invest in further U.S. growth and expanding the company&#8217;s team. Since<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/news-discovery-app-smartnews-valued-at-1-1b/"> its last fundraise in 2019</a>, where it became a unicorn, the company more than doubled its headcount to approximately 500 people globally. it now plans to double its headcount of 100 in the U.S., with additions across engineering, product, and leadership roles.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports SmartNews is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartnews-app-raises-230-million-considers-possible-ipo-11631700001">exploring an IPO</a>, but the company declined to comment on this.</p>
<p>The SmartNews app is available on iOS and Android across more than 150 countries worldwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retail investors love him. Venture capitalists envy him. But pretty much everyone writing checks these days is paying attention to Chamath Palihapitiya, whose star has been on the rise since the outset of his career at an early online media player called Winamp that was acquired by AOL.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the last 20 years, Palihapitiya &#8212; whose family moved from Sri Lanka to Canada as refugees when he was five &#8212; has been changing up the status quo of nearly everything he touches. At AOL, he became the company&#8217;s youngest VP and wound up doing a small deal with Facebook whose &#8220;biggest outcome of the deal was the connection Palihapitiya formed with Mark Zuckerberg,&#8221; as writer Steven Levy <a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-untold-history-of-facebooks-most-controversial-growth-tool-2ea3bfeaaa66">reported last year</a>. (Palihapitiya later said that one of his biggest takeaways from AOL was that, &#8220;Most people at most companies are <a href="https://genius.com/Chamath-palihapitiya-how-we-put-facebook-on-the-path-to-1-billion-users-annotated">really shit</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Hired into Facebook in 2007, his role there would prove more seminal. Though Palihapitiya reportedly floundered at first &#8212; even proposing after a year that Zuckerberg should perhaps fire him, according to Levy &#8212; he zeroed in on how to make both himself and Facebook more valuable by building a data-driven &#8220;growth team&#8221; that focused relentlessly on improving and growing the engagement of monthly active users.</p>
<p>Among its biggest successes: Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;People You Know&#8221; feature, which was heavily inspired by a similar LinkedIn feature after Palihapitiya&#8217;s team identified that new users needed to discover seven friends and fast.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kQCUEa4qJZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds is coming to Disrupt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ryan Reynolds is coming to Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/embed/#?secret=kQCUEa4qJZ" data-secret="kQCUEa4qJZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That period of Palihapitiya&#8217;s life would have wide-ranging ripple effects. For one thing, like a lot of people working at Facebook before it went public in 2012, he made a fortune from his Facebook shares, such that around the same time that he was leaving in 2011, he acquired a stake in the Golden State Warriors and founded his own venture capital firm, Social Capital.</p>
<p>Being a &#8220;former Facebook exec&#8221; also made Palihapitiya more widely famous, including as he began expressing regret publicly over his role with the company, which he began to see as corrosive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In just one of many related appearances in 2017, he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16761016/former-facebook-exec-ripping-apart-society">told an audience</a> at the Stanford Graduate School of Business what many had already begun to fear about Facebook: “I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More drama, more money and more fame have followed. In recent years, Social Capital has shed most of its employees &#8212; Palihapitiya now describes himself as a solo GP. He has become a regular guest on CNBC.</p>
<p>He has become closely identified with special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs, owing both to his early and bullish embrace of them. The first SPAC he organized merged with Virgin Galactic Holdings, enabling the space tourism company to begin trading publicly in October 2019. It performed so well that it kicked off a massive boom in SPAC activity, with Palihapitiya &#8212; whose many earlier bets include Yammer, Palantir and Box &#8212; forming or investing in more than a dozen SPACs since, including one that took public Opendoor<b> </b>and another that took public Clover Health. (Earlier this year, The New Yorker dedicated valuable real estate to Palihapitiya in a profile titled, &#8220;The Pied Piper of SPACs.&#8221;)</p>
<p>One question is whether Palihapitiya is now moving on. SPAC activity has cooled, with enthusiasm around the vehicles dampened by class-action lawsuits (including against Clover Health) and the widespread expectation that the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is about to regulate them more closely.</p>
<p>Back in March, Palihapitiya was also believed to be shifting his gaze toward environmental investment, including through the sale of his entire personal stake in Virgin Galactic for more than $200 million &#8212; a move he said was designed to help finance &#8220;a large investment I am making towards <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spac-king-chamath-palihapitiya-plans-1-billion-listing-climate-company-2021-3">fighting climate change</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>(He also late last month donated $7 million to an organization that is affixing hydropanels that supply clean water to homes in the California counties of Fresno, Monterey, Kern and Tulare, which has become &#8220;ground zero&#8221; for the climate crisis, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90669730/chamath-palihapitiya-pledges-7-million-to-california-hydropanels-that-pull-water-out-of-air">observes Fast Company</a>.)</p>
<p>What has come of that large investment he was planning to make? Is he past SPACs? And what else does the inimitable Palihapitiya have cooking? We&#8217;re very excited to say we&#8217;ll have the opportunity to talk with him about all of these things and much more in roughly one week at TechCrunch Disrupt, our signature annual event, which is entirely virtual this year. While 25 minutes will surely prove too short a time, we&#8217;ll cover as much ground with him as we can in a conversation that, if you know Palihapitiya at all, you know you definitely don&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>Even better, Palihapitiya joins a whole host of amazing speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Disrupt</a>, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.</p>
<p>The show is coming up fast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=rrpost">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 just for a few short days, and we&#8217;ll see you next week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The total addressable market that Forge serves is growing by the day, with more and more unicorns being born and a steady drumbeat of unicorn IPOs doing little to clear the decks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">Freshworks</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">Amplitude</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast</a> look to list in the coming weeks, we shouldn&#8217;t forget the SPAC boom. This week, for example, Forge Global (Forge), a technology startup that operates a market for secondary transactions in private companies, announced that it would go public via a blank-check combination.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re not unpacking every single SPAC combination that crosses our radar, the Forge deal is a good one to spend time parsing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Why? Several reasons. First, we&#8217;re curious about how the company generates revenue and how diversified its revenue is. We&#8217;re also interested in how big the market may prove to be for trading secondary shares in unicorns &#8212; late-stage tech startup equity is popular on secondary exchanges. Additionally, we want to know whether the deal feels expensive, because that may help us get a heat-check on the SPAC market more broadly.</p>

Then we get to have fun. To work!</p>
<h2>The Forge SPAC</h2>
<p>Forge is <a href="https://forgeglobal.com/press-releases/forge-global-to-go-public-in-2-billion-merger-with-motive-capital/">merging</a> with Motive Capital, a blank-check company that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/73990/Fintech-SPAC-Motive-Capital-prices-upsized-$360-million-IPO-at-$10">raised $360 million</a> in December 2020.</p>
<p>Per the company&#8217;s calculations, the combined entity will sport a roughly $2 billion valuation on a &#8220;fully diluted equity value on a pro forma basis.&#8221; The company&#8217;s anticipated <em>enterprise</em> value is a smaller $1.6 billion thanks to an expected $435 million in cash after the deal&#8217;s completion, though that number will change some before it trades.</p>
<p>Skipping the nuances of the transaction &#8212; there&#8217;s a PIPE, 90% equity rollover from existing shareholders and more, in case you wanted to get into it &#8212; what matters is that Forge will be worth around $2 billion in equity terms and have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank after the deal.</p>
<p>The resulting valuation is notable not only for making Forge a unicorn, but also for representing a dramatic upward movement in the worth of the company. PitchBook and Crunchbase data agree that Forge was last valued at $700 million (post-money) when raising $150 million earlier this year. So, the company appears set to provide a solid return to more than just its early backers; even the private investors who put capital into the company rather recently should do well in the deal.</p>
<p>That brings us to the company&#8217;s business, and business model. Forge helps pre-IPO companies trade before they float. It&#8217;s somewhat ironic that price discovery is something that the company claims its platform can help companies with before they debut, while the company is set to see its private valuation quickly beaten by a public debut.</p>
<p>Regardless, let&#8217;s talk unicorns.</p>
<h2>A solution to the unicorn traffic jam?</h2>
<p>One of my favorite long-term issues with the late-stage startup market is that it is far better at creating value than it is at finding an exit point for that accreted value. More simply, the startup market is excellent at creating unicorns but somewhat poor at taking them public.</p>
<p>That antitrust regulatory concerns have made it harder for wealthy tech companies to snap up promising startups that could challenge them is only part of the matter. There just aren&#8217;t enough IPOs, even this year, to counterbalance the growth in the number of global unicorns.</p>
<p>That pressure is a good bit of why Forge is an interesting firm. The more unexited unicorns there are in the world, the more demand, presumably, there is for marketplaces like the one it operates, which allows existing shareholders in valuable private companies to drive liquidity for themselves ahead of eventual public-market debuts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.relyance.ai/">Relyance AI</a>, an early-stage startup that is helping companies stay in compliance with privacy laws at the code level, announced a $25 million Series A today. At the same time, they revealed a previously unannounced $5 million seed round.</p>
<p>Menlo Ventures and Unusual Ventures led the A round, while Unusual was sole lead on the seed. Serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal from Unusual will join the board under the terms of the deal. His partner John Vrionis had previously joined after the seed round. Matt Murphy from Menlo is coming on as a board observer. The company has now raised $30 million.</p>
<p>Relyance takes an unusual approach to verifying that data stays in compliance working at the code level, while ingesting contracts and existing legal requirements as code to ensure that a company is in compliance. Company co-CEO and co-founder Abhi Sharma says that code-level check is key to the solution. &#8220;For the first time, we are building the legal compliance and regulation into the source code,&#8221; Sharma told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pBcfHJdaYy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">WTF is GDPR?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WTF is GDPR?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/embed/#?secret=pBcfHJdaYy" data-secret="pBcfHJdaYy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;Relyance is actually embedded within the DevOps pipeline of our customers&#8217; infrastructure. So every time a new ETL pipeline is built or a machine learning model is receiving new source code, we do a compiler-like analysis of how personal sensitive data is flowing between internal microservices, data lakes and data warehouses, and then get a metadata analysis back to the privacy and compliance professionals [inside an organization].&#8221;</p>
<p>Leila R. Golchehreh, the other founder and co-CEO, brings a strong compliance background to the equation and has experienced the challenge of keeping companies in compliance firsthand. She said that Relyance also enables companies to define policy and contracts as code.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is specifically to ingest contracts. We&#8217;ve actually created an algorithm around how [you] actually write a good data protection agreement. We&#8217;ve extracted those relevant provisions and we will compare that against [your] operational reality. So if there&#8217;s a disconnect, we will be able to raise that as an intelligent insight of a data misalignment,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With 32 employees, the co-founders hope to double or perhaps even triple that number in the next 12-18 months. Golchehreh and Sharma are a diverse co-founder team and they are attempting to build a company that reflects that. They believe being remote-first gives them a leg up in this regard, but they also have internal policies to drive it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recruiters we work with have a mandate internally to say, &#8216;Hey, we really want to hire good people and diverse people.&#8217; Relyance as a company is the genesis of two individuals from two completely different ends of the spectrum coming together. And I think hopefully, we can do our job of relaying that into the company as we scale,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>The two founders have been friends for several years and began talking about forming a company together in 2019 over a pizza dinner. The idea began to gel and they launched the company in February 2020. They spent some time talking to compliance pros to understand their requirements better, then in July 2020 began building the solution they have today. They released a beta in February and began quietly selling it in March.</p>
<p>Today they have a number of early customers working with their software, including Dialpad, Patreon, Samsara and True.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>At Burning Man a few years ago, I was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for smoking marijuana in public (in my car) and driving under the influence. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I currently have a green card and want to apply for U.S. citizenship next year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can I? If so, how should I handle my criminal record?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Remorseful About the Reefer</strong></p>
<p>Dear Remorseful,</p>
<p>As you’ve discovered, you have to be extra careful when you’re an immigrant: Obviously, you should never break the law, but as an immigrant, if you do, it can have severe and lasting consequences.</p>
<p>You even need to be careful to avoid doing things that an immigration officer might consider to be outside the bounds of good moral character, even if they are not crimes. All immigrants should remember that even though limited use of marijuana for recreational and medical uses is legal in several states, it’s <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/marijuana-hurts-your-immigration-citizenship-chances/">illegal under federal law</a>.</p>
<p>My law partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, recently <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/088-should-i-apply-for-citizenship-if-i-have-a-record/">podcasted</a> on how various crimes can impact your green card status and affect your ability to become a U.S. citizen. Take a listen and (always in this situation) consult an experienced immigration attorney. Tell your attorney about your DUI and marijuana charges, any subsequent marijuana use, any other arrests or citations, and even things you might consider minor such as speeding, parking or jaywalking tickets. An immigration attorney can determine whether you should proceed with applying for U.S. citizenship and if so, when and how to do so.</p>

<h2>What is good moral character?</h2>
<p>As you know, you must be a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least five years — or three years if you have a green card through marriage — to be eligible to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/035-becoming-a-u-s-citizen-naturalization-and-citizenship/">U.S. citizenship</a>. Additionally, you must demonstrate “good moral character” during the five- or three-year statutory period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, a corporate spend management startup, announced this morning that it now supports subsidiaries in different countries for U.S.-based businesses. As more companies lean into remote work, and a great many startups are founding themselves on multiple continents, the new capability could boost Airbase&#8217;s effective total addressable market.</p>
<p>The product news is interesting, but more so when we consider Airbase&#8217;s feature decisions in the larger context of the corporate spend management space itself. Startups competing in the market offer customers corporate cards and a software suite to help them manage spend more generally, along with other functionality that varies based on the provider in question.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">spilled much ink in recent months</a> tracking Airbase competitors Ramp and Brex, for example, as they raise capital and look to differentiate their products to better serve their target markets. They are doing so by both pricing decisions and feature choices.</p>

<p>Airbase, while perhaps less well-known than its rivals, was early to the decision to charge for its software in addition to deriving interchange revenues from its business. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">added a paid package of software</a> at an SMB-friendly price point. Ramp is sticking to its zero-cost guns for now.</p>
<p>Now with support for international subsidiaries and currencies for U.S.-based companies, Airbase is executing against its vision to provide spend management services for companies from inception through IPO, founder and CEO Thejo Kote told TechCrunch an interview.</p>
<p>In more detailed terms, Airbase supports payouts to some 200 countries, as well as support for moving money around more generally in a more constrained geographic area.</p>
<p>The product news fits into Airbase&#8217;s goal of supporting companies even as they scale. Other competitors in its market have a greater SMB focus, it appears. Not that that is a diss; offering corporate spend services as a free package has proven lucrative for some companies looking to onboard a host of smaller enterprises. Divvy did so and sold for more than $1 billion. And Ramp and Brex are pricing their services to be well within the reaches of smaller firms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ramp and Brex draw diverging market plans with M&#038;A strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/embed/#?secret=PElsFX4eHV" data-secret="PElsFX4eHV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Airbase does offer a free tier, but more as a method of attracting customers that could scale into large accounts in time, it explained. Those larger accounts are the startup&#8217;s goal. Kote said during a conversation that his company now has a number of customers paying six figures per year for its software, a change from when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/">raised $60 million earlier this year,</a> when such account sizes were rarer.</p>
<p>By adding more capabilities for multinational companies, Airbase may be able to land more large customers, which, in turn, would generate both software and interchange incomes for the startup.</p>
<p>Kote also disclosed new growth metrics for Airbase, though in relative instead of absolute terms. The startup has scaled annual recurring revenue &#8212; a metric that calculates annualized subscription software sales at a company &#8212; by 3.5x in the last 12 months, he said, and 2x in the last half-year. Kote also disclosed that his company is &#8220;approaching&#8221; $2 billion in annualized payment volume through its service, up 5x in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Now in the process of digesting its Series B, Airbase has graduated from baby startup metrics, and we&#8217;ll expect something a bit harder the next time we cover the company.</p>
<p>Still, as Airbase looks to support larger companies longer, we&#8217;re seeing an interesting divergence between the corporate spend startups battling for North American market share. With three major players charging nothing, a little and a lot, it isn&#8217;t hard to guess where each will focus their product efforts in customer terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest problems in the world of e-commerce is the predicament of shopping cart abandonment: when shoppers aren&#8217;t getting to what they want fast enough &#8212; whether it&#8217;s finding the right item, or paying for it in a quick and easy way &#8212; they bounce. That singular problem is driving a wave of technology development to make the experience ever more seamless, and today one of the companies closely involved in that space is announcing some funding on the back of healthy growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://Constructor.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constructor</a>, which has built technology that powers search and product discovery tools for e-commerce businesses, has picked up $55 million in a Series A round of funding. Constructor says that it powers &#8220;billions&#8221; of queries every month, with revenues growing 233% in the last year. Customers it works with include Sephora, Walmart&#8217;s Bonobos, Backcountry and many other big names.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Silversmith Capital Partners &#8212; which coincidentally, just today, led another round for an e-commerce startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/zonos-banks-69m-to-develop-apis-for-democratizing-cross-border-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zonos</a>.</p>
<p>It is joined by a long list of notable individual investors. They include David Fraga, former president of InVision; Kevin Weil, former head of product at Twitter and Instagram; Jason Finger, founder of Seamless; Carl Sparks, ex-CEO of Travelocity; Robyn Peterson, CTO at CNN; Dave Heath, founder of Bombas; Ryan Barretto, president at Sprout Social; Melody Hildebrandt, EVP engineering and CISO at FOX; Zander Rafael, co-founder of Better.com; and Seth Shaw, CRO at Airtable. Cap Table Coalition &#8212; a firm that helps underrepresented background investors back up-and-coming startups &#8212; was also involved. Fraga is joining Constructor&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p>The last year and a half has been a bumper one for the world of e-commerce &#8212; with more traffic, transactions and retailers moving online in the wake of social distancing measures impacting in-person, physical shopping. But that has also exposed a lot of the cracks in how e-commerce works (or doesn&#8217;t work, as the case may be).</p>
<p>One of the more dysfunctional areas is search and discovery. As most of us have unfortunately learned firsthand, when we search for things in the search window of an online store, it&#8217;s almost always the case that the results don&#8217;t have what we want.</p>
<p>When we browse as we might in a physical store, because we are not sure of what we want, all too often we are not prompted with pictures of things we might actually like to buy. They may be there &#8212; we typically visit sites because we either already know them, or have seen something we like elsewhere &#8212; but nevertheless, finding what we might actually like to buy can take a lot of time, and in many cases may never happen at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli Finkelshteyn, Constructor&#8217;s CEO and founder, says that one of the issues is that search and discovery are often built as static experiences: they are designed to meet a one-size-fits-all model where site architects have effectively guessed at what a shopper might want, and built for that. This is one area that Constructor has rethought, specifically by making search and discovery more dynamic and responsive to what&#8217;s happened before you ever visit a site.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things wrong with product discovery was that prescriptively sites show you what they think is valuable to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think the process should be descriptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example, he talked about Cheetos. Sometimes people who might want to buy these start out by navigating to the potato chip category. In many static searches, those results might not include Cheetos. Some people might abandon their search altogether (bounce), but some might navigate away from that and search specifically for Cheetos and add them to their carts. In a descriptive and more dynamic environment, Finkelshteyn believes that these two flows should subsequently inform all future chip searches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take into account as much data as we can learn from, and that list is always growing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The goal is anything we can learn from should become part of the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is the current, undisputed leader in the world of search, and it too uses a lot of dynamic, AI-based tools to learn and tweak how it searches and what results it produces.</p>
<p>Interestingly it hasn&#8217;t extended as much of this to third parties as you might think. The company <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-shutting-down-site-search-service-moving-customers-to-cse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wound down its own site search product in 2017</a> and now if you look for this you are redirected to the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/cloud-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s enterprise search suite</a>.</p>
<p>There are, however, others that have also stepped into that void to provide services that compete with Constructor, including the likes of Algolia, Yext, Elasticsearch and more. Finkelshteyn believes that among all of these, none have managed yet to provide a service like Constructor&#8217;s that learns and adjusts its results constantly based on search and browsing activity.</p>
<p>This is one reason the company has stood out with its customers, and with investors.</p>
<p>“Constructor has built a search and discovery platform that is truly making a difference for enterprise retailers. They are providing customers with comprehensive and optimized search and discovery that is unmatched in the market,” said Sri Rao, Constructor board member and general partner at Silversmith Capital Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with the Constructor team as they continue to revolutionize search and discovery capabilities for retailers across all platforms.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, there will be some interesting opportunities ahead for Constructor to take its search and discovery tools to new frontiers. These could include ways to bring in and account for shoppers on third-party platforms &#8212; currently Constructor does not power experiences on, say, social media, so that is one potential area to explore &#8212; as well as more offline experiences, critical as retailers and shoppers take on more blended approaches that might start online and finish in stores, or proceed the other way around, or find users walking around with their phones to shop even as they are in physical stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re thrilled that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5reasonspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> is just slightly more than a month away (on October 27). You have purchased your event ticket, right? No? Well then, it’s time to get your rhymes-with-SaaS in gear.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You’ll save $100 if you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5reasonspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass</a> <strong>before October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. What’s that? You need a bit more convincing? Fair enough; listen up.</p>
<p>TC Sessions are a special kind of TechCrunch event. We take one topic and devote an entire day (or sometimes two) and explore the latest trends, challenges and possibilities. And we always focus on the early-stage founders hard at work building or reinventing the sector.</p>
<p>So, what can TC Sessions: SaaS do for you? Here are five reasons why attending isn’t just essential — it’s imperative.</p>
<p><strong>1. Expand your knowledge base</strong></p>
<p>The de facto software for the B2B and B2C crowd, SaaS is rapidly expanding and constantly evolving to meet ever-increasing demand. How do you scale effectively? What’s your plan to keep company and customer data safe at a time where security threats proliferate faster than bacteria?</p>
<p>You’ll hear from and engage with the leading voices in SaaS on these and other topics like <strong>Data, Data Everywhere</strong> and <strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now</strong>. Take a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">our still-growing event agenda</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Attending TC Sessions helps us keep an eye on what’s coming around the corner. It uncovers crucial trends so we can identify what we should be thinking about before anyone else.” — Jeff Johnson, vice president of enterprise sales and solutions at FlashParking.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2. Network for opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of SaaS-y people from around the world will attend, and that means infinite possibilities for collaboration and opportunities. The following real-world example comes out of TC Sessions: Mobility, provided courtesy of Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking.</p>
<p>“TC Sessions isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.”</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">3. Connect with founders or investors</strong></p>
<p>Early-stage founders in search of funding and VCs in search of promising startups — it is ever thus, and you’ll find each other at TC Sessions: SaaS. Take advantage of CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform that makes finding and connecting with the people you most want to meet simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Start a conversation and see where it leads. It’s one big reason why Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars makes it a point to attend TC Session events.</p>
<p>“I go TC Sessions to find new and interesting companies, make new business connections and look for startups with investment potential. It’s an opportunity to expand my knowledge and inform my work.”</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4. Connect with community</strong></p>
<p>Building a startup can be a lonely pursuit, even without a pandemic. Spend a day with your people — explore the startups in the demo area, talk shop with other founders and engineers, learn the latest trends, hear SaaS icons share their journey and insight. In short, get inspired to keep at the Sisyphean task of building your empire.</p>
<p>“TC Sessions is definitely worth your time, especially if you’re an early-stage founder. You get to connect to people in your field and learn from founders who are literally a year into your same journey. Plus, you can meet and talk to the movers and shakers — the people who are making it happen.” — Jens Lehmann, technical lead and product manager, SAP.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">5. Discover new and exciting startups</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of that demo area, we’ve got 10 outstanding early-stage startups ready to show you their latest and greatest. Marvel at your colleagues’ ingenuity, start a conversation, schedule a product demo. Who knows, you might join forces and create a little SaaS magic.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=5reasonspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> takes place on October 27.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic. This time &#8217;round we took a look into the world of on-demand delivery in Europe, with a special focus on the so-called &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery sector and delivered convenience items. To help <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> get through the subject, we lassoed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/steve-o-hear/">TechCrunch alum</a> and present-day VP at <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, a company in the sector under discussion, <a href="https://twitter.com/sohear">Steve O&#8217;Hear</a> to chat with us.</p>
<p>We spent time chatting through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent news from the sector, including that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/getir-tops-1-billion-in-fundraising-this-year-with-latest-deal-ktirahny?sref=gni836kR">Turkey&#8217;s Getir has just raised a bucket of new capital</a>, and that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/grocery-startup-weezy-said-to-work-with-evercore-to-assess-sale?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Weezy is looking to exit</a>; the latter item wound up being important as we got around to discussing consolidation in the space.</li>
<li>Steve gave us an overview of Zapp, and how its approach to infra could help its economics.</li>
<li>We chatted about GoPuff and its economic fortunes, which in fundraising terms are solid, even if questions regarding future profitability are still in play.</li>
<li>And regarding the ever-present pandemic question, Steve was bullish on consumer behavior staying where it is if &#8212; when? &#8212; the COVID-19 pandemic eventually leaves us.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are back on Friday! Chat then!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s streaming TV service, YouTube TV, announced today it&#8217;s adding more Spanish-language networks to its base membership package and is preparing to launch an add-on package that will include even more Spanish-language content. Starting today, all subscribers will gain access to three new TV networks at no additional cost: Univision, UniMás and Galavisión. These will join YouTube TV&#8217;s existing lineup of over 85 live TV channels, which today include top networks like Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and others, in addition to entertainment networks like those from Discovery and ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>The additions will bring to YouTube TV members a range of new Spanish-language content, including primetime series like &#8220;La Desalmada&#8221; and &#8220;Vencer El Pasado&#8221; arriving this fall, reality competition series &#8220;Nuestra Belleza Latina&#8221; on September 26, plus the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards on November 18. The additions also bring sports programming like the Campeones Cup on September 29, and ongoing matchups from Liga MX, UEFA Champions League, MLS and the Mexican National Team, the company says.</p>
<p>Univision also noted that subscribers in top Hispanic markets, including Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston, Dallas, Chicago and others, will be able to access Univision and UniMás’ local news, weather and other programming. Plus, YouTube TV will carry Univision&#8217;s video-on-demand content library at launch, and subscribers will be able to use their YouTube TV credentials to authenticate with the company&#8217;s &#8220;TV everywhere&#8221;-powered Univision app.</p>

<p>The companies did not disclose the financial terms of their new agreement, but the deal hasn&#8217;t come with a price increase. YouTube TV, however, has been steadily hiking prices since its debut. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">increased</a> the service&#8217;s pricing to $64.99 last summer, following the new additions of 14 ViacomCBS networks, for example. But last month, YouTube Chief Product Officer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606296/youtube-shorts-fund-neal-mohan-decoder-interview">Neal Mohan said</a> there would be no new price increases in the near-term.</p>
<p>While the new channels will reach all subscribers, YouTube TV also announced plans to introduce a new add-on package that will be available for an additional monthly cost. This will include other Spanish-language networks like Sony Cine, CNN Español, Discovery en Español, Estrella TV, Cinelatino, Fox Deportes and others. YouTube TV is not yet sharing the full lineup nor the price of the add-on, but said it would offer more details in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Spanish-language network Pantaya will also be offered in the weeks ahead for an additional $5.99 per month, providing access to Spanish-language movies and exclusive original series, all of which are on-demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to partner with YouTube TV to expand Univision’s robust portfolio of networks and stations to include YouTube TV,&#8221; said Hamed Nasseri, Univision vice president, Content Distribution, in a statement. &#8220;Amid the popularity of streaming services as well as the growing influence of our Hispanic community, this is an important step to ensure that our audience has access to our leading Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment wherever they consume content. We are excited for today’s launch and recognize YouTube TV’s continued commitment to serving our growing and influential Hispanic audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>YouTube TV is not the first streamer to cater to an audience looking for Spanish-language content. In 2018, <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2018/11/02/hulu-announces-new-spanish-language-and-lifestyle-add-ons-for-live-tv-service/">Hulu added its own</a> Spanish-language bundle called ‘<a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/espanol-add-on">Español</a>,’ which now gives subscribers live programming from networks including ESPN Deportes, NBC Universo, CNN En Español, History Channel En Español, Discovery en Español and Discovery Familia. Hulu, however, doesn&#8217;t carry Univision, but does offer Telemundo. Fubo TV, meanwhile, offers Univision and Telemundo and provides an Español plan with dozens of Spanish-language channels.</p>
<p>If anything, YouTube TV had <a href="https://www.reviews.org/tv-service/best-streaming-services-for-spanish-speakers/">been behind</a> in terms of catering to Spanish speakers until now, and this offering will make it more competitive with rival services.</p>

<p>After months of publicity, an NFT auction and even a Netflix docuseries, it’s finally here: the four-person crew of Inspiration4 will be heading to space today (weather permitting).</p>
<p>What makes this launch different from any that came before it? None of the four people onboard are astronauts. The mission marks the first time that an all-civilian crew will fly to space. Let’s meet them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire whose fortune comes from the payment processing company Shift4 Payments, which went public in the summer of last year. He is the mission commander.</li>
<li>Sian Proctor, a community college professor with a PhD in science education. Proctor was among 47 finalists chosen by NASA for a 2009 astronaut class, though she was not one of the nine eventually chosen to join the agency. She will be Inspiration4’s pilot, the first Black woman to pilot a spacecraft. She’s 51.</li>
<li>Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant at St. Jude’s Research Hospital and a survivor of childhood cancer. She’ll be the crew’s health officer.</li>
<li>Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer for Lockheed Martin, also a former camp counselor at none other than Space Camp. The 42-year-old will be acting as mission specialist.</li>
</ul>
<p>The crew will be cruising to orbit inside a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which will launch from a Falcon 9 rocket. They’ll spend three days flying around the Earth before splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>SpaceX’s YouTube channel is hosting a live launch webcast starting from 3:45 PM EST, with the five-hour launch window opening at <strong>8:02 PM EST</strong>. As of Sunday, Inspiration4 said weather conditions at Kennedy Space Center looked 70% favorable. There’s also a back-up launch window opening at the same time the following day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ascend is moving insurance into the digital age by with a payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://useascend.com/">Ascend</a> on Wednesday announced a $5.5 million seed round to further its insurance payments platform that combines financing, collections and payables.</p>
<p>First Round Capital led the round and was joined by Susa Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Box Group and a group of angel investors, including Coalition CEO Joshua Motta, Newfront Insurance executives Spike Lipkin and Gordon Wintrob, Vouch Insurance CEO Sam Hodges, Layr Insurance CEO Phillip Naples, Anzen Insurance CEO Max Bruner, Counterpart Insurance CEO Tanner Hackett, former Bunker Insurance CEO Chad Nitschke, SageSure executive Paul VanderMarck, Instacart co-founders Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo and Houseparty co-founder Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>This is the first funding for the company that is live in 20 states. It developed payments APIs to automate end-to-end insurance payments and to offer a buy now, pay later financing option for distribution of commissions and carrier payables, something co-founder and co-CEO Andrew Wynn, said was rather unique to commercial insurance.</p>
<p>Wynn started the company in January 2021 with his co-founder Praveen Chekuri after working together at Instacart. They originally started Sheltr, which connected customers with trained maintenance professionals and was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005276/en/Hippo-Expands-Its-Proactive-Suite-of-Offerings">acquired by Hippo</a> in 2019. While working with insurance companies they recognized how fast the insurance industry was modernizing, yet insurance sellers still struggled with customer experiences due to outdated payments processes. They started Ascend to solve that payments pain point.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup insurance provider Vouch raises $90M, now valued at $550M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/embed/#?secret=AHPw7xadyp" data-secret="AHPw7xadyp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The insurance industry is largely still operating on pen-and-paper — some 600 million paper checks are processed each year, Wynn said. He referred to insurance as a “spaghetti web of money movement” where payments can take up to 100 days to get to the insurance carrier from the customer as it makes its way through intermediaries. In addition, one of the only ways insurance companies can make a profit is by taking those hundreds of millions of dollars in payments and investing it.</p>
<p>Home and auto insurance can be broken up into payments, but the commercial side is not as customer friendly, Wynn said. Insurance is often paid in one lump sum annually, though, paying tens of thousands of dollars in one payment is not something every business customer can manage. Ascend is offering point-of-sale financing to enable insurance brokers to break up those commercial payments into monthly installments.</p>
<p>“Insurance carriers continue to focus on annual payments because they don’t have a choice,” he added. “They want all of their money up front so they can invest it. Our platform not only reduces the friction with payments by enabling customers to pay how they want to pay, but also helps carriers sell more insurance.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Startups like Ascend aiming to disrupt the insurance industry are also attracting venture capital, with recent examples including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/vouch-business-insurance-provider-to-startups-raises-90m-and-is-now-valued-at-550m/">Vouch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/">Marshmallow</a>, which raised close to $100 million, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/">Insurify</a> raised $100 million.</p>
<p>Wynn sees other companies doing verticalized payment software for other industries, like healthcare insurance, which he says is a “good sign for where the market is going.” This is where Wynn believes Ascend is competing, though some incumbents are offering premium financing, but not in the digital way Ascend is.</p>
<p>He intends to deploy the new funds into product development, go-to-market initiatives and new hires for its locations in New York and Palo Alto. He said the raise attracted a group of angel investors in the industry, who were looking for a product like this to help them sell more insurance versus building it from scratch.</p>
<p>Having only been around eight months, it is a bit early for Ascend to have some growth to discuss, but Wynn said the company signed its first customer in July and six more in the past month. The customers are big digital insurance brokerages and represent, together, $2.5 billion in premiums. He also expects to get licensed to operate as a full payment in processors in all states so the company can be in all 50 states by the end of the year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurify, a &#8216;virtual insurance agent,&#8217; raises $100M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/embed/#?secret=d2DJnEMoIT" data-secret="d2DJnEMoIT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The ultimate goal of the company is not to replace brokers, but to offer them the technology to be more efficient with their operations, Wynn said.</p>
<p>“Brokers are here to stay,” he added. “What will happen is that brokers who are tech-enabled will be able to serve customers nationally and run their business, collect payments, finance premiums and reduce backend operation friction.”</p>
<p>Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round Capital, met Wynn while he was still with Sheltr. He believes insurtech and fintech are following a similar story arc where disruptive companies are going to market with lower friction and better products and, being digital-first, are able to meet customers where they are.</p>
<p>By moving digital payments over to insurance, Ascend and others will lead the market, which is so big that there will be many opportunities for companies to be successful. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/commercial-insurance-market-is-projected-to-reach-usd-1-227-80-billion-by-2028-growing-at-a-cagr-of-8-5-valuates-reports-890462419.html">global commercial insurance market</a> was valued at $692.33 billion in 2020, and expected to top $1 trillion by 2028.</p>
<p>Like other firms, First Round looks for team, product and market when it evaluates a potential investment and Trenchard said Ascend checked off those boxes. Not only did he like how quickly the team was moving to create momentum around themselves in terms of securing early pilots with customers, but also getting well known digital-first companies on board.</p>
<p>“The magic is in how to automate the underwriting, how to create a data moat and be a first mover — if you can do all three, that is great,” Trenchard said. “Instant approvals and using data to do a better job than others is a key advantage and is going to change how insurance is bought and sold.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ability to offer stock options is utterly essential to startups. They convince talented people to join when the startup is unlikely to be capable of matching the high salaries that larger, established tech firms can offer.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s a complex business developing a competitive stock option plan. Luckily, London-based VC Index Ventures today launches both a handy web app to calculate all this, plus new research into how startups are compensating their key hires across Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&amp;employee_country=us&amp;mode=seed">OptionPlan Seed</a> is a web app for seed-stage founders designing ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans). The web app is based on Index’s analysis of seed-stage option grants, drawing on data from more than 1,000 startups.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Index Ventures’ Nina Achadjian and Sarah Cannon: &#8216;There&#8217;s basically an infinite bid&#8217; for growth-stage startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/infinite-bids-index-ventures/embed/#?secret=aUTdQaUgvJ" data-secret="aUTdQaUgvJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The web app covers a variety of roles; six different levels of allocation benchmarks; calculates potential financial upside for each team member (including tax); and adjusts according to policy frameworks in the U.S., Canada, Israel, Australia and 20 European countries.</p>
<p>It also builds on the <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/optionplan/#expected_funding_rounds_pre_exit=series-b-and-c&amp;employee_country=us&amp;mode=venture">OptionPlan for Series A companies</a> that Index launched a few years ago.</p>
<p>As part of its research for the new tool, Index said it found that almost all seed-stage employees receive stock options. However, while this reaches 97% of technical hires at seed-stage startups and 80% of junior nontechnical hires for startups in the U.S., in Europe only 75% of technical hires receive options, dropping to 60% for junior nontechnical hires.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That said, Index found stock option grant sizes are increasing, particularly among startups “with a lot of technical DNA, and weighted towards the Bay Area”. In less tech-heavy sectors such as e-commerce or content, grant sizes have not shifted much. Meanwhile, grants are still larger overall as seed valuations have grown in the last few years.</p>
<p>Index found the ESOP size is increasing at seed stage, following a faster rate of hiring and larger grants per employee. Index recommends an ESOP size at seed stage is set at 12.5% or 15%, rather than the more traditional 10% in order to retain and attract staff.</p>
<p>The research also found seed fundraise sizes and valuations have doubled, while valuations have risen by 2.5x in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Additionally, salaries at seed have “risen dramatically”, with average salaries rising in excess of 60%. Senior tech roles at seed-stage startups in the U.S. now earn an average $185,000 salary, a 68% increase over three years, and can rise to over $220,000. But in Europe, the biggest salary increases have been for junior roles, both technical and nontechnical.</p>
<p>That said, Index found that “Europe’s technical talent continues to have a compensation gap” with seed-stage technical employees in Europe still being paid 40-50% less on average than their U.S. counterparts. Indeed, Index found this gap had actually widened since 2018, “despite a narrowing of the gap for nontechnical roles”.</p>
<p>Index also found variations in salaries across Europe are “much wider than the U.S.”, reflecting high-cost hubs like London, versus lower-cost cities like Bucharest or Warsaw.</p>
<p>The war for talent is now global, with the compensation gap for technical hires narrowing to 20-25% compared to the U.S.</p>
<p>Index’s conclusion is that “ambitious seed founders in Europe should raise the bar in terms of who they hire, particularly in technical roles”, as well as aim for more experienced and higher-caliber candidates, with larger fundraises to be competitive on salaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://inspiredcapital.com/">Inspired Capital</a>, the New York-based early-stage venture firm that was founded in 2019 by entrepreneurs Alexa von Tobel and Penny Pritzker, is today announcing the close of their second fund with $281 million in capital commitments, an amount that brings the firm&#8217;s total assets under management to nearly half a billion dollars. (Inspired raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/inspired-capital-founded-by-alexa-von-tobel-and-penny-pritzker-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-200-million/">$200 million</a> for its debut fund.)</p>
<p>We talked earlier this week with von Tobel about the portfolio of 25 companies that her firm &#8212; which also counts as co-founders partner Lucy Deland and COO Mark Batsiyan &#8212; helped to fund with its first vehicle. We also talked, of course, about Inspired&#8217;s new fund, which, like its predecessor, will be used to invest in a wide range of companies, mostly, but not exclusively, in the U.S.</p>
<p>Excerpts from that conversation follow.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a larger fund &#8212; will the strategy remain the same?</strong></p>
<p>AV: We&#8217;re the same team, same strategy, same everything, so [writing] seed to Series A [checks]. We can go from early, early seed &#8212; truly, like a napkin idea &#8212; all the way to writing $15 million checks. We&#8217;re still really collaborative, so we both lead and co-lead deals. We&#8217;re a generalist fund investing around the country, so our first fund was equally weighted on East and West Coasts by companies that ranged from many categories.</p>
<p>[Editor&#8217;s note: Some of these include the business banking startup Rho, a LatAm real estate company called Habi, the embedded payments startup Finix and an autonomous landscaping startup called Scythe that makes all-electric mowers and employs a robots-as-a-service revenue model.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You rolled out your first fund five months before the coronavirus shut down the U.S. How did that impact you?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AV: We stood up fund one in February, 2019, then I had my third child, then we closed the fund that summer, so yes, we literally went into COVID. But it was a brand-new fund with fresh capital, so by nature, any of the companies that we backed, we&#8217;d <em>just</em> backed, so they were in good shape; they had 24 months of runway.</p>
<p>Also, our team has over 55 years of connectivity. Lucy and I have known each other for 20 years. Mark and I have known each other for 11 years. Penny and I have known each other for almost a decade. Our VP of platform has been with me for 12 years. Even [my PR firm] has been with me for almost 12 years, so that allowed us to be extremely nimble to what was happening in the world.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/what-startups-can-learn-from-learnvests-250-million-acquisition/"> founded and sold</a> a financial planning company, LearnVest. Inspired isn&#8217;t funding fintech exclusively, but it sounds like you are investing only in the U.S. when there&#8217;s a lot happening in fintech elsewhere, too.</strong></p>
<p>AV: We invested 40% of our first fund on the East Coast, 40% on the West Coast, and 20% in the middle of the country, as well as internationally. For example, we have a great [Bogota, Colombia-based] portfolio company called <a href="https://habi.co/">Habi</a> that&#8217;s on an exceptional course and that just raised <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/06/27/colombian-ibuyer-habi-raises-100m-in-softbank-led-series-b/">$100 million</a> led by SoftBank. I&#8217;ve known [co-founder Brynne McNulty Rojas] for years, and we had a really clear thesis on the category, so I went and tapped her on the shoulder and said, &#8216;Can we back you?&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which companies have received the most capital from Inspired so far?</strong></p>
<p>AV: Habi is one. Another is <a href="https://www.meetdandy.com/">Dandy</a> [a company that&#8217;s trying to modernize the dental lab process]. A third is <a href="https://orum.io/">Orum</a> that we helped incubate. [It aims to speed up interbank transfer and closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/orum-raises-56m/">$56 million</a> in Series B funding in June.] It was super early. It was my old team from LearnVest.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you planning to incubate more companies, or was that more of an anomaly?</strong></p>
<p>AV: When the stars properly align, you will absolutely see more of that from us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Businesses and the tech companies that serve them are run on data. At best, it can be used to help with decision-making, to understand how well or badly an organization is doing, and to build new systems to run the next generation of services. At its most challenging, though, data can represent a real headache: there is too much of it, in too many places, and too much of a task to bring it into any kind of order.</p>
<p>Enter a startup called Matillion, which has built a platform to help companies harness their data so that it <em>can</em> be used, and what&#8217;s more the platform is not just for data scientists, but it&#8217;s written with a &#8220;low-code&#8221; approach that can be used by a wider group of users.</p>
<p>Today, it is announcing a big round of investment &#8212; $150 million at a $1.5 billion valuation &#8212; a sign not just of Matillion&#8217;s traction in this space, but of the market demand for the tech that it has built.</p>
<p>The company currently has &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of large enterprise customers, including Hundreds of large enterprises including Western Union, FOX, Sony, Slack, National Grid, Peet’s Coffee and Cisco for projects ranging from business intelligence and visualization through to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the funding, with Battery Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners &#8212; some of the biggest enterprise startup investors in the world &#8212; also participating. Matillion last raised money &#8212; a Series D of around $100 million million &#8212; as recently as February this year, at what was an undisclosed valuation at the time.</p>
<p>Announcing this latest round at a $1.5 billion valuation is significant not just for Matillion. The startup was founded in Manchester (it now also has a base in Denver), and this makes it one of a handful of tech startups out of the city &#8212; others we&#8217;ve recently covered include The Hut Group, Peak AI and Fractory &#8212; now hitting the big leagues and helping to put it on the innovation map as an urban center to watch.</p>
<p>Matthew Scullion, the startup&#8217;s CEO and founder, explained that the crux of the issue Matillion is addressing is the diamond-in-the-rough promise of big data. Typically, large organizations are producing giant amounts of data every day, hugely valuable information as long as it can be tapped efficiently. The problem is that this data is often sitting across a lot of different places &#8212; typically large organizations might have over 1,000 data sources, apps sitting across multiple clouds and servers, and storage across Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Databricks. On top of this, while a lot of that data is very structured, those sources are not necessarily aligned with each other.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Data has become the new currency, and the world is pivoting to that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s changing all aspects of how we work, and it is happening very fast. But the problem is that the world’s ability to innovate with data is constrained. It’s not the shortage of data or demand to put it to work, but the point is the world’s ability to make that data useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matillion has answered that with a framework and system that can both identify data sources and basically bring order to them, without needing to move the data from one place to another in order to be used. It&#8217;s an ETL (extract, transform, and load) provider, and it is far from being the only one in the market, with others like Dataiku, Talent, SnapLogic, as well as cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft, among the many trying to address this area.</p>
<p>The difference with Matillion, Scullion said, is that it has democratized platform, so that organizations don&#8217;t have to rely on data scientists to get involved in order to use it, by building a low-code interface around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made it accessible, intuitive and easy to use by bringing in a low-code approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve developed a platform and data operating system that has all the things in the kit bag that an organization needs to make it useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is important because, as big data analytics and the tools to build these processes become more mainstream and themselves take on low-code interfaces, Matillion is providing a way for those less technical users to source and use their data, too. This means more efficiency, less cost, and more time for data scientists to work on more difficult problems and do less busy work.</p>
<p>“As organizations look for ways to harness data to make better business decisions, the market for cloud data integration and transformation is expanding,” said Chris Caulkin, MD and Head of Technology for EMEA at General Atlantic. “We believe that Matillion’s low-code ETL platform simplifies the process of constructing data pipelines and preparing data for analysis, enabling citizen data scientists and data engineers alike to play a valuable role in extracting data-based insights. We look forward to supporting the team through its next phase of growth and expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, a startup called Olive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/olive-launch/">launched its new shopping site and app</a> with the goal of making e-commerce more efficient, convenient, and sustainable by offering a way for consumers to aggregate their orders from across retailers into single shipments that arrive in reusable packaging, not cardboard. If items need to be returned, those same packages are reused. Otherwise, Olive will return to pick them up. Since its February 2021 debut, the company has grown to include over 100 retailers, predominately in the fashion space. Today, it&#8217;s expanding again by adding support for another 25 beauty retailers.</p>
<p>Launch partners on the new effort include brands like Supergoop!, Kora Organics, Pai Skincare, Erno Laszlo, Jecca Blac, Sahajan, Clark&#8217;s Botanicals, NuFace, Purlisse, Cover FX, LYS Beauty, SiO Beauty, Peace Out Skincare, Koh Gen Do, Julep Beauty, In Common Beauty, Indie Lee, Glow Recipe, Ursa Major, RMS Beauty, Ceremonia, Sweet Chef, Follain, and BalmLabs.</p>
<p>They join Olive&#8217;s numerous apparel and accessory retailers like Adidas, Superga, Rag &amp; Bone, Birdies, Vince, Goop, Khaite, and Veronica Beard, among others.</p>
<p>To support the expansion, Olive also developed a new set of reusable packaging that has protective elements for more damageable items. While before, the company had offered a variety of packages like soft-sided garment bags and various sizes of more rigid containers (see below), it&#8217;s now introducing its own alternative to the air bubble strips you&#8217;ll find in most Amazon boxes these days. Olive&#8217;s version is integrated into its reusable packaging and can be easily deflated by the customer when it&#8217;s time to return the package at pickup.</p>

<p>The idea for Olive is a timely one. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">e-commerce adoption has soared</a>. But so has consumers&#8217; guilt. Multiple packages land on doorsteps every week, with cardboard and plastic to recycle &#8212; if that&#8217;s even available in your area. Delivery trucks &#8212; Amazon, UPS, FedEx, and others &#8212; are now a daily spectacle on every city street. Meanwhile, market leaders like Amazon and Walmart seem largely interested in increasing the speed of delivery, not necessarily the efficiency and sustainability. (Amazon allows shoppers to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17928921011">pick an Amazon Day delivery,</a> for consolidated shipments, but it&#8217;s opt-in.)</p>
<p>Olive founder Nate Faust says he was inspired to build the company after realizing how little interest there was from larger e-commerce players in addressing some of the inconveniences and inefficiencies in the market. Faust had previously served as a vice president at Quidsi (which ran Diapers.com and Soap.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/confirmed-amazon-spends-545-million-on-diapers-com-parent-quidsi/">and sold to Amazon</a>), then co-founder and COO at Jet, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart for $3.3 billion</a>. Before Olive, he was a senior vice president at Walmart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After some soul searching, he realized he wanted to build something in the e-commerce space that was focused more on the social and environmental impact, not just on driving growth and consumption.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an epiphany one evening when taking out the trash and recycling,&#8221; Faust explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty crazy that we&#8217;re this far into e-commerce and this is the status quo delivery experience &#8212;  all this waste, which is both an environmental issue and a hassle for consumers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And the bigger issue than the packaging is actually the fact that the majority of those packages are delivered one at a time, and those last-mile emissions are actually the biggest contributor of carbon emissions in the post-purchase e-commerce supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Consumers may not think about all the issues, because many of them are hidden, but they do struggle in other ways beyond dealing with the waste. Returns are still a hassle &#8212; so much so, that Amazon now allows customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/you-can-now-take-your-amazon-returns-to-all-kohls-stores/">to go to Kohl&#8217;s</a> where it&#8217;s partnered on in-store return kiosks that also help the brick-and-mortar retailer increase their own foot traffic.</p>
<p>Plus, consumers who shop from different sites have to set up online accounts over and over, entering in addresses and payment information many times, which is an annoyance. Olive offers the convenience of an Amazon-like one-stop-shop experience on that front.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Olive addresses the return issue by allowing consumers to simply place their unwanted items back in Olive&#8217;s packaging then leave them on their doorstep or with the building&#8217;s doorman for return. It works with both the USPS and a network of local carriers to serve the customers in its current footprint, which is about 100 million U.S. consumers on both coasts.</p>
<p>While customers don&#8217;t have to deal with packaging, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely eliminated from the equation at this point. Olive today partners with retailers who ship packages to its own west coast and east coast warehouses, where they repackage them into the reusable containers to deliver to customers. Right now, that means Olive is responsible for the recycling issues. But it&#8217;s working with its brand partners to have them pack orders directly into the reusable packaging from the start &#8212; before shipping to Olive&#8217;s consolidation warehouses for delivery. Today, it has a few retailers on board with this effort, but it hopes that will eventually expand to include all partners.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue on an affiliate commission model, which works for now. But over time, it may need to evolve that business model over time, as its customer base and partnerships grow. At present, around 10,000 consumers have used Olive, ahead of any large-scale marketing and customer acquisition efforts on the startup&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>For now, New York-based Olive is growing its business by way of a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/olive-0779-series-a--d6a07429">fundraise</a> of around $15 million from investors including Invus, Primary Venture Partners, and SignalFire.</p>
