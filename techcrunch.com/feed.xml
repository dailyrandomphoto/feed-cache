										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Los Angeles-based commerce and content platform <a href="https://www.stackcommerce.com/">StackCommerce</a> has been acquired by the<a href="https://www.integratedmedia.com/"> Integrated Media Company,</a> a holding company set up by the massive private equity fund, TPG, to acquire new media businesses.</p>
<p>StackCommerce&#8217;s affiliate buying platform has distributed more than $175 million on its platform by going directly to merchants. Through its platform publishers can make between 15% to 20% of gross compared with 5% on an affiliate marketing site. Stackcommerce takes 30% to 40% of the transaction, according to a person with knowledge of the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>As a part of Integrated Media, StackCommerce will join properties like Fandom and Goal.com. With the firepower of TPG behind the combined entity, Integrated Media could bolt on other media companies and then monetize them using the sales engine developed by StackCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Josh and the team at Stack have already built a large and important company in the e-commerce ecosystem with almost no outside investment,” said Andy Doyle, Operations Director at TPG. “And yet we’re still in the early stages of the market’s evolution. We feel fortunate to partner with a team that has such deep expertise in commerce and technology. We look forward to supporting Stack’s rapid growth as it serves more publishers and influencers and provides an even better shopping experience for audiences.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a business that&#8217;s been incredibly profitable for the Los Angeles company, which raised $1 million from the LA-based accelerator and incubator, Amplify and a few angel investors. That $1 million round took the company to a business that employed around 90 people and was generating $80 million in revenue in 2020, according to a person familiar with the company.</p>
<p>StackCommerce has partnered with over 1,000 publishers and 5,000 brands including CNN, CNET, Verizon Media, Hearst, Mashable, NY Post, TMZ, MarketWatch, and more, according to a statement.</p>
<p>“We founded StackCommerce nearly a decade ago to reimagine affiliate commerce for publishers by enabling them to own the customer data and user experience top to bottom. We’ve been pioneering the commerce and content space ever since, helping publishers to build and scale this new revenue stream at a higher rate and with access to content creation services, user acquisition, and more,” said Josh Payne, the founder and chief executive of StackCommerce, in a statement. “Today is not just an important day for Stack, but for the future of shoppable content. TPG’s in-depth media expertise will make for a brighter future for our partners through further investment in our industry-leading commerce tools and services.”</p>
<p>StackCommerce was advised by investment bank CG Petsky Prunier, part of the Canaccord Genuity Group. Cooley LLP acted as legal advisor to StackCommerce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://babbel.com/">Babbel</a>, the Berlin-based language-learning platform, today announced that it is now going well beyond its core app-based learning service and is introducing <a href="https://try.babbel.com/live/">live classes</a>.</p>
<p>Capped at six students, these conversation-driven classes will be taught by certified teachers, using Babbel&#8217;s existing methodology. Learners can add live classes to their existing Babbel subscription for an additional fee, starting at $110 for five classes/month, or subscribe to them as a standalone product (though they&#8217;ll also get access to the Babbel app as part of their live subscription).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, though; Babbel is also introducing language-learning games in its app for the first time, as well as short stories to help learners use their new vocabulary, short snippets of fun facts about various cultures and a new set of videos about different places and languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This launch follows what was a banner year for Babbel. Besides crossing a milestone at 10 million subscriptions sold, the company also realized $150 million in recognized revenue in 2019, Babbel&#8217;s U.S. CEO Julie Hansen told me, and that number is significantly higher this year (though Babbel didn&#8217;t disclose any revenue numbers for 2020 yet). She also noted that while the company saw growth across markets, the U.S. saw especially strong growth, with revenue and subscriber numbers up 100%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107369" style="width: 353px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107369" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2107369" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?w=410" alt="" width="343" height="568" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png 2470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=90,150 90w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=181,300 181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=768,1274 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=410,680 410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=926,1536 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=1235,2048 1235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ENG-SPA-Word-Trax.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2107369" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Babbel</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In the U.S. [&#8230;] when we ask people why [they want to learn a language], the ones that say &#8216;for travel&#8217; are the highest converters normally,&#8221; Hansen told me. &#8220;So I was in such a panic by mid-March, thinking that our business is going to go to zero. No one&#8217;s traveling. And it was just the exact opposite. People found in language learning &#8212; as they did in bike riding and sourdough bread baking &#8212; a creative outlet, self-improvement or a rewarding investment in themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the live classes, the set of available language combinations is still limited as the company starts to scale the program. For now, English speakers can sign up for <a href="https://try.babbel.com/live/">Spanish and German classes</a>, while German speakers can get lessons in <a href="https://de.babbel.com/live">English and Spanish</a>. The plan is to add additional language pairs over the course of the year.</p>
<p>The overall goal for Babbel, Hansen noted, is to meet the needs of language learners across a wider spectrum, be that videos and podcasts, or these new live lessons. &#8220;It&#8217;s about embracing a more holistic view of the user&#8217;s language-learning experience and meeting their needs at more points along that journey,&#8221; Hansen said.</p>
<p>She also noted that providing a live experience is, in many ways, about quality control. &#8220;We&#8217;ve put a lot of work into teacher recruitment, teacher training, teacher reviews,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are giving them the tools to be successful. We&#8217;re not just saying: &#8216;hey, there&#8217;s the app, go figure it out.&#8217; There&#8217;s materials for every lesson. There&#8217;s guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2NowNY0np8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, Babbel is working with about 100 teachers and, after a quiet beta rollout, the company is now seeing thousands of students in class every week. &#8220;The end game for this year should be on a couple hundred teachers and tens of thousands of students in class every week,&#8221; Christian Hillemeyer, Babbel&#8217;s director of communications, noted.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of language-learning apps as live tutoring services, Babbel may be the first service at its scale that aims to combine both. And beyond the live classes, Babbel is leaning into its overall content production beyond the core app features, with more podcasts and the short stories and culture snippets it is now adding to the app and &#8212; maybe even more importantly &#8212; as free videos and podcasts on YouTube and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the new features, the team also took a look at its existing lessons, and over the course of the last year, its teachers spent a lot of time making the course content more concise and the overall lesson length shorter, based on feedback from its didactics team. The team also introduced a new onboarding flow that includes a placement test so that learners can start using the app at the right level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly a year ago, the spread of COVID-19 ended the daily commute for millions of Americans, an abrupt change that sent the ridesharing industry into a free fall.</p>
<p>Hip, which connected commuters with third-party bus and shuttle operators via an app, was just one of the many mobility-as-a-service startups that watched its clientele and revenue dwindle. Instead of cutting costs and waiting out the pandemic and the disruption it delivered, Hip expanded.</p>
<p>Hip added a business-to-business offering to its platform, a move aimed at companies and manufacturers preparing to bring back workers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Instead of holding back we actually doubled down and increased our platform,&#8221; CEO Amiad Solomon said in a recent interview, adding that the decision was prompted by discussions they had with large corporations that were struggling with how to safely bring employees back to the office.</p>
<p>The bet has paid off, Solomon said. The company, which employs 20 people at offices in New York City and Tel Aviv, has not only landed new customers, it has also raised $12 million. The funding round was <span style="font-weight: 400;">led by NFX and Magenta Venture Partners, with participation by AltaIR Capital and former Uber, Booking.com and Google executives. The funding will be to hire more workers and expand its engineering, sales and operations.</span></p>
<p>Hip works with companies, in any location, to determine their needs. The company developed an internal tool that companies can use to upload thousands employees and their home addresses. That information is then used to help companies determine their needs and control costs.</p>
<p>On the most basic level, the Hip platform connects companies to the bus and shuttle providers. It offers route planning and has a contact-tracing tool to help companies track COVID-19 infections. Companies can also use the platform to set vehicle capacity controls and add customized features within the app, such as health and consent forms. Employees can use the app to book tickets, reserve seats and track their transportation in real time.</p>
<p>Employee shuttles are not new. The difference, Solomon said, is the flexibility that this platform provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the same route, it&#8217;s not the same people and it&#8217;s not the same frequency,&#8221; Solomon said. We built out the entire infrastructure, both in terms of technology, but also in terms of our distribution. We now support over 200 cities with our partners in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hip locked in its first corporation in late October and now has a handful of active customers. There are dozens more companies that are ready to use the platform once they decide to bring workers back, Solomon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re working on the corporate side, we see how much opportunity there is,&#8221; Solomon said. &#8220;I think that we&#8217;ll move more and more into this direction of providing modern software systems and the connection between that software and the transportation providers — to be that glue that connects corporations and their ground transportation needs to the world of our vetted partners and providers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud hosting company <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/">Scaleway</a> is adding a new type of instances today — Mac minis powered by Apple’s M1 chip. The <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/hello-m1/">new instances</a> cost €0.10 per hour, around $0.12 at today’s rate —&nbsp;there’s a minimum commitment of 24 hours.</p>
<p>Scaleway is hosting those new computers in its DC4 data center in Paris —&nbsp;it’s a former underground nuclear fallout shelter. Right now, the Mac minis aren’t available in the company’s other data centers in Amsterdam or Warsaw.</p>
<p>When you boot up a Mac mini from the console, you get an entry-level Mac mini with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD and macOS Big Sur. And of course, it uses Apple’s first Arm-based chip, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/apple-announces-the-m1-the-first-member-of-its-apple-silicon-family/">the M1</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can connect to the instance using VNC — you’ll see the desktop environment and you’ll be able to use it like a normal Mac. You can also connect to the instance using SSH directly in case you only need a command line interface.</p>
<p>Scaleway isn’t the first company to offer Mac mini instances. Amazon Web Services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/aws-brings-the-mac-mini-to-its-cloud/">recently launched</a> its own Mac mini instances, but they rely on Intel i7 CPUs and costs $1.083 per hour — or $26 for 24 hours. The company will likely roll out M1 minis at some point in the future.</p>
<p>There are also several Mac-focused hosting companies out there, such as MacStadium, MacinCloud, MacWeb and Mac Mini Vault. An M1-powered Mac mini with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage currently costs $109 or €109 per month on MacStadium — that’s slightly more expensive than Scaleway. If you keep a Mac Mini instance for 30 days on Scaleway, it costs €72 (or $87 at today’s rate).</p>
<p>You can use Mac servers for development purposes, and specifically for continuous integration and delivery. Building an iOS app requires a Mac. You can’t just build the app on an Ubuntu server. So if you want to build your app on a server, you have to rent a Mac.</p>
<p>But you may have different use cases for a Mac server. You might want to use it to test your macOS app on Apple silicon before releasing it. Or you might just want to play around with the M1.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We are now seeing, with the rise of remote working, better talent than ever before. But we still have a long way to go."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The exodus out of San Francisco and New York is making a big impact on Miami, a city that’s been steadily growing into a tech hub over the last 15 years. We’re seeing a “moment” in Miami, but many are hoping — and working — to turn it into a movement.</p>
<p>In late January, Softbank Group International <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/softbank-launches-a-100-million-fund-for-miami-based-startups/">announced a $100 fund</a> directed at Miami&#8217;s exploding tech scene. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/softbank-is-just-the-latest-validation-for-miamis-booming-startup-scene/">As explained in this article</a>, this is the latest validation that Miami is booming. Softbank Group Intl. told TechCrunch this ahead of his announcement. &#8220;Miami is quickly evolving to accommodate increasing demand as it becomes a growing startup destination. From emerging &#8216;elder tech&#8217; to biotech, Miami is an attractive investment market that offers unique opportunities for immigrants and minorities to pursue entrepreneurship opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic has been the catalyst for change, and Miami locals are embracing newcomers and helping them feel at home, hoping that by bringing their talents to South Beach, their bank accounts will follow.

<h2>Marcelo Claure, CEO, Softbank Group Intl.</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? </strong></p>
<p>Miami is quickly evolving to accommodate increasing demand as it becomes a growing startup destination. From emerging “elder tech” to biotech, Miami is an attractive investment market that offers unique opportunities for immigrants and minorities to pursue entrepreneurship opportunities. Between 2012 and 2018, Miami-Dade saw a 40% growth in the tech sector, indicating a healthy business trajectory. We anticipate that this trend will only continue in the years to come.</p>
<p>We also know the biggest challenge is getting started, with talent acquisition as the first step toward building a viable headquarters location in any new city. Miami offers a number of attractive benefits including cost of living, lifestyle and opportunity to grow. It’s a natural bridge from Latin America that allows businesses and entrepreneurs to expand seamlessly to the U.S. with an active cultural base. This is a time of exponential opportunity and at SoftBank, we are committed to supporting the technology ecosystem in the Miami market.</p>
<p>Miami has always been close to our hearts — our $5 billion Latam Fund was born in Miami and is headquartered here.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>The accelerated global shift to remote work as the new normal means that talent and entrepreneurship have no geographical boundaries. Miami has significant advantages over competitive markets, including no state income taxes, a commitment to arts and culture, and beautiful weather that encourages an active lifestyle. Florida has seen an insurgence of talent from the technology and finance sectors — in September of 2020 it was reported that roughly 1,000 people were moving to the state every day. That’s incredible.</p>
<p>While remote work is part of the future fabric of business, there’s no replacement for face-to-face interaction in building company culture. We believe that businesses may decrease their traditional office footprint slightly, but will continue to seek space in co-working spaces or rental spaces that are prime destinations for headquarters. We think there will be continued significant net growth in the number of offices located in the city.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you are most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>At SoftBank, we invest in technology-focused companies in various sectors — from fintech, to agritech, to education. We invest in the entrepreneurs and companies that are leading the digital transformation of these sectors. Over the last year, we’ve recognized a dramatic shift in where these entrepreneurs call home. For years it was mainly Silicon Valley and New York City — today, it’s also Austin, Dallas, and (of course) Miami. Due in large part to the tireless efforts of Mayor Suarez, Miami has been positioned at the forefront of innovation and the tech industry.</p>
<p>Many of the businesses we’re seeing pop up in Miami are natural fits for what we’re looking to invest in. Through our Latam Fund, we invest in companies focused on the Latin American region. In an effort to address the long-standing diversity and inclusion issues within the VC community we also launched a $100 million Opportunity Fund, focusing on companies founded by Black, Latino and Native American entrepreneurs. So far, we’ve evaluated over 700 companies and have made ~20 investments totaling $20 million. These investments span multiple sectors (healthcare, SaaS, fintech, gaming and more) — sectors we’ve seen growing in Miami.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you have encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Any market poses natural challenges, but there are far fewer barriers to entry in Miami and Florida as a whole. Access to a robust, diverse local professional network is an incredibly valuable resource for companies. Top names in technology and VC are moving to Miami and urging others to do the same.<br />
Take the example of Keith Rabois, who decided to make it his 2021 resolution to rally support for a mass pilgrimage from Silicon Valley to Miami. We are seeing many such examples that are driving the perception of Miami as a hotspot for tech networking. At SoftBank, we have deep roots in Miami and we’re excited to encourage other entrepreneurs to join us here.</p>

<h2>German Fondevila, investment manager, Clout Capital</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? The city has attracted a wide range of people over the years, including more tech and finance companies very recently. How will it add up to something more than the sum of the parts?  </strong></p>
<p>I moved to Miami in 2016 from Barcelona, Spain and I decided to stay because I realized the potential the city held. The first thing to note is that it’s an ecosystem in the making, so it’s still maturing. I believe in the coming years Miami will solidify its identity in the broad startup scene. More talent will relocate here and I hope we will see more companies redomicile here as well. Miami is culturally rich, vibrant and people seem to smile more often than in other cities.</p>
<p>It’s important to state we should avoid jumping on the “hype wagon” right away. There’s a lot of potential for this city, but Rome wasn’t built in a day. There are different layers to building a strong startup community. It’s a messy multivariable problem with no exact recipe. This is a long game we’re playing, so expectations need to be adjusted in that sense. I think it’s funny when people compare it to San Francisco or New York. Had they been in those cities 30 years ago while they grew to become what they are today … surely a lot was missing. I think people with an entrepreneurial mindset will gravitate toward places “in the making.” Here, one can take on an active role in shaping the city’s future and your own.</p>
<p>We also need to come together, talk to each other more and be more deliberate in helping Miami grow. When I moved here I wore the entrepreneur hat. Something that shocked me then was seeing how different players of the ecosystem didn’t collaborate that much with each other. Everyone seemed to be doing their thing. I’ve always thought we should have a “Startup Council” of some sort. To gather every relevant and legitimate stakeholder at the table and work organized to leverage Miami’s strengths. Mayor Francis Suarez has been doing a great job recently, but he’s going to need help to discern the noise from the signal.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution? </strong></p>
<p>I have been a defender of remote work for several years. Specifically, the idea of a distributed workforce and the infrastructure that supports it. People think remote work means working in your pajamas from home or at a beach somewhere in the Caribbean (I have done both, I confess). People want flexibility, it’s inevitable. We are finally shifting from the Industrial Revolution model toward the knowledge worker type of organizations.</p>
<p>I don’t think offices will disappear from Miami, but what will change is the density of office space near downtown and the way we develop cities. My guess is that the co-working space model will come back stronger with larger adoption. People will go to work in an office space, it just won’t always be with people from their same company. These will be more evenly distributed around residential areas, cutting commutes; freeing up peoples’ time will lead to a higher sense of well-being that will revert back into productivity.</p>
<p>Startups with distributed teams will be more normal. Capital, however, will take longer to get accustomed to the idea of investing beyond the city limits. A lot of investors like to be in the same city where the founders are. It will take some time to normalize capital dispersion in that sense. Investors have a herd mentality so it will take some top investors to question this status quo publicly to get the ball rolling. A good recent example of this is the recent move of Keith Rabois from Founders Fund to call Miami home.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>With our new $60 million fund, we’re looking to partner with entrepreneurs raising their Series A in Latin America and Florida. Occasionally we participate in seed deals as well.</p>
<p>We tend to gravitate toward product-driven companies. It’s always stimulating to find companies that are not just trying to build a “copycat” but have a genuine IP or value-add in their product or business model. We primarily focus on SaaS, enterprise software, proptech, fintech and insurtech, although we look at many companies outside of that scope. Ultimately, we aim to partner with amazing teams.</p>
<p>There are several great teams in the city and naming only a few wouldn’t be fair. I’m personally excited about investing in collaboration tools that empower the future of work, applied AI and AI infrastructure, payments and e-commerce enablement. I am also becoming increasingly curious about consumer subscriptions. I find the merge between the recurring revenue model of a SaaS and the large market of a B2C business quite powerful.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>The main challenges we hear about are the access to qualified talent (technical or not) and access to capital. The former should be less of a barrier now that people are relocating here and the increasing trend of hiring from a distributed workforce. The access to capital has improved over the last few years with more firms opening in South Florida, covering a wider range of a startup’s lifecycle. Yet, we still need more smart capital. I am hopeful that this will be the case in the coming years.</p>
<p>Miami attracts people of all kinds, so there are all kinds of Miami/s that you can experience. I always like to say that you have to pick the one that works for you. There are a lot of very intelligent people with interesting backgrounds and life stories here, they’re also probably not hanging out at Wet Willies or talking about “popping bottles.” I recommend that people avoid having preconceived judgments about the city, especially at the beginning. You have to come with an open mind, take it for what it is, both the good with the bad. I’m always happy to connect with people that have just relocated here and show them what Miami truly can be.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders, or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>Like any developing ecosystem, there are a lot of important players. Some of the stakeholders that have been committed to helping Miami’s ecosystem include The Knight Foundation, Miami Angels, CIC, Refresh Miami, Wyncode, Next Legal, PAG Law, The LAB, Secocha Ventures, Animo Ventures, Las Olas VC, The Venture City, among many others. I highly encourage outsiders to go beyond the surface of a quick Google search. I have found that it is often the least “flashy” that tends to be worth connecting with.</p>
<h2>Tigre Wenrich, CEO, LAB Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>All of the recent buzz sounds a lot like 1999 to me. It wasn’t so much immigrants from California then, but rather from Latin America. I wasn’t living here (I was in Mexico), but I remember the press started going wild about Miami becoming “Silicon Beach” and a lot of startups opened expensive offices on Lincoln Road. After the dot.com bubble burst in 2000, most of them went out of business or (like MercadoLibre, who became wildly successful but with no Miami presence) went back to Latam.</p>
<p>I am cautiously optimistic that this time is different. It’s great to have big name VCs moving to Miami to save on state taxes, and I applaud Mayor Suarez for the very active promotional role he has been playing. Some of these people are being very vocal about wanting to contribute to the local community, which is awesome. But this is not what gives me conviction about Miami’s future as a tech hub.</p>
<p>The real reason I am optimistic is the slow but steady growth of the local tech community over the past 8 to 10 years. We now have several very large tech companies based in South Florida (e.g., Chewy, Magic Leap, Reef), a much larger pool of local talent, important regional offices for companies like Google, Facebook, Uber, etc, and other large corporations have been opening tech offices here (e.g., JetBlue, Blackstone). And most importantly, we have a small but growing pool of entrepreneurs who have realized successful exits and are giving back by investing in and mentoring new startups.</p>
<p>This is not a recent phenomenon, but rather a trend that has been building since at least 2012 when we opened The LAB Miami. The growth in co-working spaces, accelerators, incubators, university entrepreneurship, and computer science programs, coding schools, and other kinds of organizations offering support to entrepreneurs has been a long-term project that has enabled the recent Twittermania about Miami as the next Silicon Valley. The success of major tech centers like Silicon Valley is based on having a community of different actors that feed off of each other and reinforce each other, thus the overused metaphor “ecosystem.” Miami wasn’t at critical mass 20 years ago (or even 10), and so its tech movement in 1999 was just a tech moment. But today we are approaching critical mass, and I expect that in another five years Miami as a tech hub will become an accepted reality and no longer a topic of debate.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t believe that offices will disappear from Miami, but the way we use offices will certainly change. While many jobs can be performed remotely forever, many service professions rely on an apprenticeship model, which is very hard to maintain over Zoom (lawyers, accountants, management consultants, etc.). Corporate culture can be maintained with remote work over the short term, but it’s very hard to transmit to new hires. I also believe there is a huge pent-up demand for people to socialize and that there will be a rush back to offices once the vaccines have been rolled out and it’s safe to go back.</p>
<p>The office of the future will likely look very different, however. There will be more shared spaces and areas for people to collaborate. Permanently assigned offices will become much less common as more people transition to a rotational schedule that includes a couple of days a week at the office and the others work from home. Whether this means that demand for commercial office space will decrease or not is unclear. Very dense downtown markets may struggle, but demand will likely surge in suburban markets. I also expect to see a rush back into co-working spaces in the second half of 2021, both as a base to host fully remote workers and as an option on the days when people don’t want to go all the way downtown to their “regular” office. Some people can work very productively from home, but many of us find it quite distracting!</p>
<p>The number of fully remote workers in this country has permanently increased by the pandemic, and if you can live anywhere, then Miami is obviously a compelling option. But all that does for us is drive up housing prices. Those people will be relatively less connected to the local community and less likely to stay long term. The real opportunity is if more companies choose to set up operations here, bringing permanent job growth with them — that has to be the goal. If we succeed, then Miami may very well need more office space, not less.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>At LAB Ventures, we focus on proptech (tech companies that serve the real estate and construction industries). Our focus is not just on Miami, it is global.</p>
<p>We are quite excited about the opportunities in residential real estate, especially with the booming single-family market. Our local portfolio companies with the most traction are focused here, including Beycome — a digital real estate agent that helps consumers to buy or sell their home by themselves, saving thousands in commissions, and Expetitle — a title agency that enables fully remote real estate closings. Both raised seed rounds during the pandemic and have been growing strong throughout.</p>
<p>Construction tech is another area we believe is poised for very strong growth. We’ve invested in a number of companies that provide solutions for the construction industry, including on-site labor tracking, project management software and offsite modular construction. Miami is a great place to pilot these technologies because there is so much construction activity here, and you have very large local players that are actively trying to innovate. We are also the gateway to Latin America, and we are seeing opportunities to bring technology from the region into the U.S., as well as to help Latin American construction companies to deploy innovative new technology from the US.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Access to capital and the local talent pool are two challenges that everyone mentions, and they are very real. But I think we are making huge progress on both fronts. A third one that I would add is Florida’s reputation as a haven for con men and weirdos. While we do objectively have more than our fair share of fraud, it is also true that the cultural diversity and immigrant ethos that permeates Miami brings a deep pool of creative and hardworking people. We are also a very open community — since almost all of us are from somewhere else, we tend to be more welcoming to newcomers. The local tech community is still small too, so it’s really not very hard to figure out what’s what pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>There are many great founders doing important things in Miami. Here are just a few of them at the top of my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aaron Hirschhorn — Aaron is building Gallant, a stem cell banking business for pets, and has raised a ton of money already from big-name VCs (and on Shark Tank). He moved here a couple of years ago after selling his startup DogVacay to Rover.</li>
<li>Andres Moreno — In addition to still running Open English, Andres is the co-chair of Endeavor Miami and is actively involved in two other early-stage startups (Longevo and Escala).</li>
<li>Maurice Ferré — He is the capo of the Paypal Mafia for Miami health tech; he sold Mako Surgical and is now investing in and mentoring a slew of really legit startups.</li>
<li>Jose Rasco and Juan Calle — Sold .CO in 2014 and are now involved in many other projects, including the co-working space building.co.</li>
<li>Ariel Quinones at IronHack — He’s based in Miami, but they are the market leader in Europe and just raised another $10 million last month; they are building something big.</li>
<li>Felipe Sommer and Emiliano Abramzon. They built Nearpod but recently stepped back from day-to-day management. I’m sure they’ll do something else big soon.</li>
<li>Marco Giberti — Marco is an entrepreneur turned angel investor and a pioneer in “company building,” or what we call the “venture studio” model. He is a co-founder at LAB Ventures and also an expert on EventTech (about which he literally wrote the book).</li>
<li>Lawyers: PAG.LAW — They represent a huge share of Miami startups, as well as startups from Latin America that have or want to have a U.S. presence or U.S. legal entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Rebecca Danta, managing director, Miami Angels</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>I believe people will continue to move here more than ever before. Some of the current buzz may fade, but we will continue to see people actively choosing to live and do business here. Before 2020, living in Miami was sometimes seen as a lifestyle choice, but something that set you back careerwise. We’re already starting to see that is no longer the case. We’re now solidifying ourselves as a real place for tech companies and investors to thrive. We will see the startups that began a few years ago mature and hire more talent at a faster rate as they grow, and we will see more employees of those companies leave to start their own companies.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>I see hybrid work environments being essential in a post-pandemic world and we’re already seeing that with Pipe’s recently announced microhubs, for example. I don’t think all tech jobs and companies will be 100% remote (many will), and I definitely don’t think they’ll be 100% location-based and in-person five days a week. Founders have more options than ever before on where to headquarter their companies, and although employees won’t have to relocate for a job, founders will choose cities that are attractive when it comes to quality of life and a supportive work environment. And if Miami is one of those options, it won’t be hard to attract talent here.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>We are industry agnostic (within early-stage software) at Miami Angels. We’ve been investing in Miami companies since 2013, but we don’t only invest in Miami companies. Some industries that have always been exciting for Miami are edtech and healthcare tech because of our large school and hospital systems. We also have a lot of local expertise and innovation in these areas, which has also been accelerated by the pandemic. At Miami Angels, we’ve invested heavily in these areas over the years; we believe in honing in on areas that are already key for a geography.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Although we’ve had a few notable success stories, we’re still in our infancy as a tech ecosystem. The majority of startups here are still small and have less than 50 employees. This means most companies do not have large product, design and engineering teams. We have good, local talent graduating from our universities but we will continue to see that talent leaving to other cities until we have a larger mass of startups that are able to hire 20+ junior engineers each year, for example. The best product, design and engineering talent is simply not concentrated here right now. Luckily, we can absolutely attract this talent, but it is important that founders know this.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. </strong></p>
<p>A successful ecosystem is all about the founders, so it’s absolutely the founders who built startups here a few years ago and really took a bet on Miami that deserve special attention. They consciously chose to build here, believing in Miami, even when outside investors told them it wasn&#8217;t a great idea. Some of these Miami founders we&#8217;ve backed include Alex Nucci of Blanket, Chris Sopher, Rebekah Monson, and Bruce Pinchbeck of WhereBy.Us, Emiliano Abramzon and Felipe Sommers of Nearpod, Maxeme Tuchman of Caribu, and Jason Dettbarn of Addigy. We also have our eye on Emma Harris of Kiddo, Evan Leaphart of Kiddie Kredit, and Emil Hristov of Domaselo.</p>
<h2>Kevin Cadette, executive director, Black Angels Miami</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? </strong></p>
<p>Miami will expand as an ecosystem for innovators, builders and investors as each community will experience rapid growth and greater interconnectivity. And, if I have a say in this matter, Black Angels Miami will be a critical foundational piece to this community. There are many angel investors that call Miami and South Florida home and that trend will continue on the back of general regional population growth. Black Angels Miami will continue to galvanize the opportunity for investors, educating those new to investing with our Black Angels U programing, in addition to creating opportunities to be Limited Partners in funds.<br />
Miami is a very diverse city and there are many active organizations working to ensure that it remains diverse as the ecosystem grows. The groundwork for what Miami Tech is today has been laid for many years. The Knight Foundation has been at the forefront of supporting organizations in the ecosystem, and that infrastructure is bearing the fruits of today.</p>
<p>As I believe we are scratching the surface of tangible success stories coming out of Miami, I anticipate Miami to be nationally recognized in the next five years as one of the most important entrepreneurial metro regions in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>Remote work will ignite our technology evolution that is already simmering. Miami’s designation as a city where people enjoy spending time will be a major boon for remote work. People want to be here! Offices may disappear, just as they are in all metro areas, but companies are also moving into Miami. Miami and South Florida have demonstrated that one can live and work here without compromise. With more large companies relocating, startups building and investors living in South Florida, I believe Miami’s startup scene will only become stronger.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Black Angels Miami is sector agnostic, and we are looking for the best early-stage ventures with high growth potential in Miami and anywhere in America. I’m most excited about growth industries that have large total addressable markets that offer delightful solutions for companies and individuals globally.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>One of the local challenges here is its biggest opportunity: The tight-knit, collaborative nature of the city. Miami is a very collaborative community — send an email to someone here and you will get a reply, and will most likely steer you in the right direction. Everyone is trying to collaborate; it’s very much a rising tide for all. We all want to see success stories coming out of the community. However, if you are trying to build here, it can be difficult if you haven’t immersed yourself in the community. The one piece of advice I have to new arrivals would be to reach out to those already here. It is easy to be based here and carry on working virtually as you did before, but then you are missing out on exciting opportunities. The Miami ecosystem is very relationship-based and the doors are wide open.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>There are many “movers and shakers” in the ecosystem. I will just take this opportunity to thank the Knight Foundation for all that they’ve done to support Miami tech. Just take a look at who they have supported through the years, and you’ll see the foundation they have laid.</p>
<h2>Mark Kingdon, founder, Quixotic Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now? </strong></p>
<p>The city has attracted a wide range of people over the years, including more tech and finance companies very recently. How will it add up to something more than the sum of the parts? In five years, I believe we will have had more notable exits that show the world that Miami can produce major companies. Building an ecosystem takes time. Decades even. Investors, entrepreneurs, startup employees are attracted to Miami. Significant exits occur. Money is recycled into new startups. It’s a virtuous cycle. We&#8217;re at the early stages now.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>The trend for remote work is an important trend for Miami. It is already a major hub for Latin America that will increase substantially. Miami is an easy trip from NYC. I can see many NYC inhabitants moving south as I did but maintaining their connection to NYC as I did.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund? </strong></p>
<p>I focus on e-commerce and e-commerce enablement. I have a narrow focus by design. I&#8217;m excited by founders with grit, determination, a great idea and ideally some traction. Sktchy has shown that grit and determination.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city? </strong></p>
<p>Hiring today is a challenge. The candidate flow isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;d see in NYC. You can&#8217;t post a job on Friday and have 10 applicants on Monday. It takes longer here to recruit. That&#8217;s workable but only if founders identify needs early and understand there is a longer process to fill key roles.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know. </strong></p>
<p>There are too many to name; that&#8217;s the fantastic thing about Miami. The community is super welcoming and always has time for new people; it’s wonderful and not something I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. A few of the people who helped me get started in Miami include: Nico Berardi, Juan Pablo Cappello, Melissa Krinzman, Matt Haggman, Raul Moas, and Jesse Stein. Miami Angels has been a great community to be part of — the board: me, Melissa Krinzman, Juan Pablo Cappello, Raul Moas, Nico Berardi, Tigre Wenrich, and Marco Giberti have invested in more than 50 Miami companies. Miami Angels has invested in three dozen more. In my opinion, Miami Angels has done a great deal to bring new investors into the ecosystem and to connect them with locals.</p>
<h2>Ana Gonz<span class="s1">á</span>lez, head of partner funds, 500 Startups</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>There is a unique window of opportunity for Miami to position itself as a regional and even global hub for entrepreneurs. Miami can build on years of investment by public and private entities in the ecosystem, and shape the identity and brand that it wants to showcase to the world. The city can double down on its core strengths and identify new assets that will provide growth into the future. Miami has incredible access to a diverse pool of talent, is well positioned geographically, has a great quality of life and favorable tax policies. A number of industries also have a strong presence in the city and are growing at global scale, including healthcare, logistics and transportation, fintech, blockchain and crypto. New sectors that align with Miami’s future also include climate resiliency, smart cities and sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 pandemic has only accelerated the trend that we’d begun to see in the previous years in which more and more, people are able to choose where to live independently of where their work is. Miami stands front and center in this movement. As people continue to realize the great quality of life that they can have in this city, they move here to settle down, or even better, to build things locally that enable them to stay. This in turn increases quality and density of talent, and feeds the positive feedback loop that makes Miami more and more attractive to live and work in. As the COVID-19 vaccine enables us to move toward in-person meetings and events again, we believe that we will all have to learn to live in a new hybrid model (mix of digital and in person) for building interpersonal relationships, doing business and living our lives overall. Miami can be a great innovator in this sense, just as it has already started innovating with novel outdoor theater productions that are safe and interesting to watch.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>At 500 Startups we accelerate and invest in tech-enabled, seed-stage startups that are coming up with novel solutions and building the industries of tomorrow. And we are sector agnostic. In Miami, we are excited to see the growth of certain industries such as fintech, healthcare, transportation and logistics. There are also contactless solutions being developed that will be especially relevant in the world post-COVID, in the security, travel and hospitality, and financial services industries.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Founders in Miami generally struggle in accessing early-stage capital (anything from angel investing to seed to pre-Series A rounds), as well as finding good talent, especially in engineering, growth and product management roles. This is typical in the development of a new ecosystem. But for Miami, we are excited that this is changing quickly as more and more talent and capital funders are moving here now.</p>
<p>What is great about Miami is how connected it is with other ecosystems. The traditional connection has been with Latam, but now much more with the Bay Area, New York and Europe. So more and more companies are able to do business in Miami, but leverage the global network connected with the city to find the talent, capital and access to markets that you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystem roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>There are so many great people doing amazing work in Miami. What’s great is most people here seem to genuinely want to build something for all. I&#8217;d suggest as a starting point:<br />
Maria Derchi (Refresh Miami), Matt Haggman (Beacon Council), Raul Moas (Knight Foundation), Rebecca Danta (Miami Angels), and Tigre Wenrich (The Lab Ventures).</p>
<h2>Tom Wallace, managing partner, Florida Funders (Tampa)</h2>
<p><strong>Where do you see Miami’s startup scene five years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Although there has been a lot of news about the growing tech community in Miami over the past several months, this plan of transforming Miami and Florida as a whole to a technology hub has been in the works for years. If you look at how technology ecosystems are built, it comes down to two things: talent and capital. The state of Florida has always had a lot of capital but unlike California and New York most of our wealth does not come from technology. What we have seen though is the rise and sale of some great unicorn companies here in Florida that has ultimately fueled the organic growth of the ecosystem. When unicorns liquidate many new millionaires are made and those millionaires are starting their own companies. Just like HP in Silicon Valley, Microsoft in Seattle and Dell in Austin, this is how technology ecosystems are built. So in five years, Miami and Florida as a whole will potentially be a leading technology ecosystem in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Remote work is pushing and pulling the global workforce. This means that offices will disappear from Miami, even with more companies moving in, but also more locals who work remotely for companies elsewhere. How do you see these factors impacting the city’s tech evolution?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no doubt we’re benefiting from the trend in remote work — historically, we’ve been working to build great companies here. We’ve never struggled proving that Miami is an amazing place to spend time. With the shift toward remote work, we’re accelerating the trend of smart people moving here to work for companies that may not be based here, but moving forward, they’ll start or join companies that are local.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t believe that offices will be completely eliminated. If you look at the companies moving to Miami and Florida (like Blackstone and Goldman Sachs) they’re setting up sizable footprints. Offices will change forever and people will continue to have the ability to work from home for many companies, but there will always be an in-person element of work that cannot be replaced by Zoom. I especially think this is true in early-stage technology companies. For great conversation and innovation nothing beats being in a room with your entire team working through problems on the whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>What industry sectors do you focus on within Miami (and beyond)? What is happening in Miami now that you’re most excited to fund?</strong></p>
<p>Being the gateway to Latin America has a massive appeal to me and us here at Florida Funders. The Latin American technology market is still in a very early stage, and Miami is where Latam companies jump into the U.S. and vice versa. Logistics and microlending platforms are a major interest. The secondary sector I am beginning to get serious about is fintech. With major players such as Goldman and Blackstone setting up operations in Miami there will be innovative fintech companies that follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the local challenges you&#8217;ve encountered or seen founders struggle with? More generally, how should people looking to hire in, invest in or relocate to Miami think about doing business in the city?</strong></p>
<p>Talent, specifically tech development talent has always been a struggle in the state of Florida. We are now seeing, with the rise of remote working, better talent than ever before. But we still have a long way to go. Ecosystems like Boston, Silicon Valley, and even my home town of Pittsburgh have world-class institutions pumping out great tech talent. We do not have that yet here in Florida although the University of Florida and Florida Polytechnic Institute are trying to bridge the talent gap with some great new educational initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to say Florida Funders is really moving the needle on the capital side in Florida. In Miami, there are some amazing physical locations that have become startup hubs such as the CIC or now the new Mana Development. Also, I know our attorneys at Greenberg Traurig, especially partner Jaret Davis, are making large strides to support the community and have been for years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Miami tech is in a nascent phase to the outside world, and it allows the locals and newcomers to learn from major tech hubs' mistakes and decidedly do things differently.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami has long been a refuge for those escaping the cold or Latin American countries in political and economic turmoil. But, in 2020, it welcomed investors, founders and others in tech leaving San Francisco and New York City, partly propelled by the pandemic, seeking a welcoming government, lower taxes, a decent climate, less expensive housing, a dynamic lifestyle and the type of diversity that&#8217;s proven to help companies thrive.</p>
<p>Investors are bullish on Miami, TechCrunch found. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/8-miami-area-investors-assess-americas-southernmost-tech-ecosystem/">In a survey with eight local investors</a>, they point out the strengths and opportunities of the growing market.</p>
<p>Moving the needle, Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank and long-time Miami advocate, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/softbank-launches-a-100-million-fund-for-miami-based-startups/">announced a $100 million fund</a> dedicated solely to startups based in Miami or those planning on moving here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For many, the dream is that Miami comes to enjoy the economic prosperity of places like San Francisco and New York City while maintaining the current tech community&#8217;s focus on building a Miami for all.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;Miami is quickly evolving to accommodate increasing demand as it becomes a growing startup destination. From emerging &#8216;elder tech&#8217; to biotech, Miami is an attractive investment market that offers unique opportunities for immigrants and minorities to pursue entrepreneurship opportunities,&#8221; Claure told TechCrunch just before making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/softbank-launches-a-100-million-fund-for-miami-based-startups/">the funding announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Claure knows the potential of Miami tech firsthand. In 1997 he founded Brightstar, a global wireless company. In 2013, SoftBank purchased a majority stake in the company for a cool $1.26 billion. His brother Martin is a tech entrepreneur too, and currently the founder and CEO of <a class="c-link" href="https://aprende.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://aprende.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Aprende Institute</a>, a Miami-based Spanish language skills retraining startup.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SoftBank earmarks $100 million for Miami-based startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/softbank-launches-a-100-million-fund-for-miami-based-startups/embed/#?secret=5P3oKnJUIh" data-secret="5P3oKnJUIh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Miami has served Claure well, so it&#8217;s no surprise he and SoftBank believe so vehemently in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;At SoftBank, we invest in technology-focused companies in various sectors — from fintech, to agritech, to education,&#8221; Claure said. &#8220;[SoftBank] invests in the entrepreneurs and companies that are leading the digital transformation of these sectors. Over the last year, we&#8217;ve recognized a dramatic shift in where these entrepreneurs call home. For years it was mainly Silicon Valley and New York City — today, it&#8217;s also Austin, Dallas and (of course) Miami. Due largely to the tireless efforts of Mayor Suarez, Miami has been positioned at the forefront of innovation and the tech industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the businesses we&#8217;re seeing pop-up in Miami are natural fits for what we&#8217;re looking to invest in,&#8221; Claure said. &#8220;Through our Latam Fund, we invest in companies focused on the Latin American region. In an effort to address the long-standing diversity and inclusion issues within the VC community, we also launched a $100 million Opportunity Fund, focusing on companies founded by Black, Latino and Native American entrepreneurs. So far, we&#8217;ve evaluated over 700 companies and have made ~20 investments totaling $20 million. These investments span multiple sectors (healthcare, SaaS, fintech, gaming and more) — sectors we&#8217;ve seen growing in Miami.&#8221;</p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p>In 2020, Miami saw about $1.9 billion pour into the region, up 21x from 2010, which brought in about $89.5 million, according to Crunchbase data. While 2020 was a great year and with some standout deals: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/">REEF Technologies</a> raised $700 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/florida-based-logistics-provider-shipmonk-raises-290-million-on-the-back-of-rising-ecommerce-demand/">ShipMonk</a> drew in $290 million, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/magic-leap-has-apparently-raised-another-350-million-in-spite-of-itself/">Magic Leap</a> brought in another $350 million, it didn&#8217;t quite beat 2019&#8217;s record-breaking $2.39 billion that flowed into South Florida-based startups. While in 2010, only 12 companies in Miami raised outside funds, by 2020, we saw that number jump to 70, signaling a healthy amount of tech entrepreneurship in the area.</p>
<p>While the pandemic and remote work may have jolted the first movers, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez&#8217;s off-the-cuff response to a tweet suggesting Silicon Valley be relocated to Miami seemed to get the flywheel going. &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/francissuarez/status/1335037068108554241?lang=en">How can I help?</a>&#8221; he put out into the universe. And the universe responded with a flurry of inquiries about tech life in Miami.</p>
<p>Refresh Miami, the largest tech nonprofit in the state boasting 11,000 members, spent the holidays putting together a &#8220;<a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/welcome-to-miami-guide/">New To Miami Guide</a>,&#8221; which aims to answer everything from &#8220;Where should my kids go to school in Miami?&#8221; to &#8220;What are some of the best co-working spaces?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some new residents might be testing the waters while living the nomadic life, but many others have bought property, set up shop and started the recruiting process — both for their next startup but also to ensure their friends are here, too.</p>
<p>Miami&#8217;s recent story can&#8217;t be told without the inclusion of Keith Rabois, a partner at Founders Fund and a member of the PayPal mafia who flagrantly left San Francisco. Rabois made an equally notable splash in Miami with the purchase of a <a href="https://therealdeal.com/miami/2020/12/17/tech-investor-keith-rabois-pays-record-29m-for-venetian-islands-home/">$29 million Miami Beach mansion</a> that includes a saltwater aquarium so big it requires a scuba diver to maintain. Since moving to Miami, he has become one of the most vocal and ardent recruiters for Miami tech&#8217;s future. He cryptically announced on Twitter that he&#8217;s started a Miami-based company and is hiring, though he hasn&#8217;t publicly disclosed what the company does or will do.</p>
<p>Other big names include the finance heavyweight Blackstone, who recently announced their new office in Miami, providing 215 tech jobs. They&#8217;ve already signed on some local talent, according to a source. Then, of course, there&#8217;s Plug and Play, the Silicon Valley global innovation platform and investor who announced last week it will be opening a location downtown. But some other VCs who have recently relocated are doing what great VCs do best: seizing on an early opportunity that not quite everyone believes in yet. Those include Jon Oringer of Shutterstock, David Blumberg of Blumberg Capital, Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz, David Goldberg of Alpaca, whose portfolio includes ClassPass and ClassWallet, Maya Baratz Jordan of FFNY, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, known for co-founding both Gilt and Glamsquad, and Laura González-Estéfani, a Facebook vet who moved here four years ago to open The Venture City, an accelerator and venture fund with a Miami HQ, but that also has offices in San Francisco and Madrid.</p>
<h2>Why Miami</h2>
<p>The pandemic has pushed many to rethink what they want out of life. And is work, an exorbitantly priced microapartment and poor governance enough?</p>
<p>Miami is international, diverse and multilingual, with English and Spanish being the dominant languages within the business sectors. Many are attracted to the city&#8217;s cosmopolitan style and sophisticated art and culture scene, culminating with Art Basel Miami Beach every December. You can find virtually every major restaurant from New York to London here, but the Miami locations usually include ample outdoor seating. The architecture is second to none, with buildings by the famed Zaha Hadid, Arquitectonica and landscaping by Raymond Jungles. While the Broadway play &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; was doubly sold out in New York City and London, you could catch the show for a fraction of the price at the Adrienne Arsht Center. Some people I know went twice.</p>
<p>Many say Miami — and any other coastal city — is best experienced from the water. Well, don&#8217;t let the fact that your custom-built megayacht hasn&#8217;t arrived yet stop you from getting that glowing tan. Miami-based <a href="https://www.boatsetter.com/">Boatsetter</a>, a startup that lets people rent other peoples&#8217; boats, has a fleet waiting for you. Or perhaps you&#8217;d rather go for a meditative paddle on Biscayne Bay; you could use <a href="https://www.padl.co/">PADL</a>, the recently launched Miami startup that aims to be the paddleboarding industry&#8217;s Lime.</p>
<p>Miami has always had fun and games. Still, in 2013, Manny Medina, one of Miami&#8217;s early tech entrepreneurs with a successful exit (he sold real-estate-turned-data center Terremark to Verizon for $1.4 billion in 2012), launched eMerge Americas, an annual tech conference. It unofficially established Miami as a tech hub that connects the Americas. By 2019, the event attracted more than 16,000 attendees from 400 participating companies and more than 40 countries. With a world-class airport within 15 minutes of the city center, few other cities can compete with Miami&#8217;s strategic geographic location and easy access. But the question remains: Can Miami become another great tech hub?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly headed in the right direction, and some investors are bullish on the market while others, who are more cautious, think it&#8217;s too soon to say.</p>
<p>Miami&#8217;s hot sectors include healthcare, proptech, fintech, elder tech, logistics and edtech. Exits to know include Chewy (whose $3.35 billion exit in 2017 resulted in the largest e-commerce sale to date), the well-funded YellowPepper acquisition by Visa (terms not disclosed), and 2020&#8217;s darlings include Ascyrus Medical, which went for $200 million and CareCloud for $32 million.</p>
<p>Those still on the runway include Nearpod, Magic Leap, Ultimate Software, ShipMonk, CarePredict, MDLIVE, Papa, Caribu, Brave Health and REEF, among others. Then, there&#8217;s the new kids on the block, such as UpsideHōm, HealthSnap, Domaselo, Secberus, Marco Financial, Birdie, Kiddie Kredit, ConciergePad and Sustalytics.</p>
<p>Miami has long been known as a wealthy enclave bursting at the seams with money. Still, historically, that money has gone into safer and more traditional investments such as real estate. The notion of writing a $100,000 check for an idea and then forgetting about it is still very rare. Many local investors tend to be slower to move and often still prefer the round being led by an outsider who has experience vetting deals, a common complaint by local founders who find themselves seeking funding across the country. But with more VC money in town now, smart capital should be more accessible.</p>
<p>That being said, one of the main things the area has going for it, and which can&#8217;t be replicated, is its people and their propensity to build, grow and welcome others. &#8220;The community is super welcoming and always has time for new people; it&#8217;s wonderful and not something I&#8217;ve ever experienced before,&#8221; said Mark Kingdon of Quixotic Ventures. Organizations that have catalyzed the movement over the years include the Knight Foundation, Endeavor, Miami Angels (Florida&#8217;s largest angel investment collective), Refresh Miami (an organization that provides startup news, events and creates community), Venture Cafe (a weekly gathering with educational programming for innovators), 500 Startups and The Venture City.</p>
<p>While Miami&#8217;s diversity is as ingrained in the culture as the cafecito breaks, the local tech community has been, and continues to be, adamant about putting diversity, inclusion and gender equity at the forefront of Miami tech. In a recent <a href="https://wearemiamitech.com/">Miami Tech Manifesto</a>, drafted up by community members themselves, Miami tech told the world how things would continue to work around here. Women may not run the world yet — it&#8217;s debatable — but it&#8217;s fair to say they run Miami tech, and they are bringing everyone else with them.</p>
<p>Miami tech is in a nascent phase to the outside world, and it allows the locals and newcomers to learn from major tech hubs&#8217; mistakes and decidedly do things differently. For many, the dream is that Miami comes to enjoy the economic prosperity of places like San Francisco and New York City while maintaining the current tech community&#8217;s focus on building a Miami for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy Automation</a>, a startup that was part of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/13265">Y Combinator Winter 2020 cohort</a>, announced today that it has closed $5 million across two rounds, the most recent of which brought $4 million to the company in October of 2020.</p>
<p>The new funds were raised at a $16 million pre-money, $20 million post-money valuation, Alloy told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest fundraising was led by <a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/">Bain Capital Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.abstractvc.com/">Abstract</a>, with participation from <a href="https://color.capital/">Color Capital</a>, <a href="https://boxgroup.com/">BoxGroup</a> and a collection of individual investors, including <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraBehrens">Shippo&#8217;s Laura Behrens Wu</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/saraduit">Sara Du</a>, CEO, and <a href="https://twitter.com/greggmojica">Gregg Mojica</a>, CTO, about the round, their market and their experience in Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Du, a Harvard dropout, and Mojicam, who skipped college altogether, met after the former emailed the latter about speaking at an open-source conference. The event didn&#8217;t end up happening, but the pair stayed in touch. Du wound up running a small streetwear store, interested in automation and app-connecting tools like Zapier, which she found to be too simple, and MuleSoft, which she described as very expensive. Out of a desire for something in between that would let her connect apps, Alloy Automation was eventually born.</p>
<p>After a<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/alloy-automation"> launch on Product Hunt in 2019</a> offering &#8220;complex automation made easy, and with no code,&#8221; Bryant Chou, a founder at WebFlow, put money into the company. Alloy was looking to build prosumer automation tooling and now it had material backing.</p>
<p>The startup then went through Y Combinator the next year, sharpened its focus to the e-commerce market and, as it has just announced, attracted millions more from a cadre of investors.</p>
<p>The shift to focus on e-commerce from a broader toolset came from customer pull, the co-founders said. After starting out with a number of integrations for Twilio, HubSpot and other services, the team, toward the end of their time in Y Combinator, noticed places in the e-commerce world into which their product fit neatly. Alloy&#8217;s tech was being used by Shopify and BigCommerce customers, helping make e-commerce a fertile area for the company, its co-founders said.</p>
<p>Alloy&#8217;s tech helps e-commerce players link services to help automate their shipping, marketing, analytics and other tasks. One example that Du provided TechCrunch was customers using Alloy to connect SMS functionality to fulfillment tools. Doing so might allow small e-commerce companies to automatically text customers when their order ships, for example.</p>
<p>During Y Combinator, the pair said that they might have been the youngest set of founders in their batch. But despite being what they described as not the hottest company in the batch, they skipped the accelerator&#8217;s well-known demo day, having already raised capital.</p>
<p>Du said that it&#8217;s not generally encouraged to skip demo day. But as Alloy has gone on to raise even more capital, the decision seems to have worked out for the company. The founders also cited a desire to stay in stealth as part of their reasoning for skipping the investor confab, telling TechCrunch that they wanted to stay quiet and build until they &#8220;really [had] something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alloy&#8217;s $4 million round came from a relationship that started when the startup had shown off its tech on Product Hunt. Bain had contacted the startup then, stayed in touch, and later did due diligence on it by talking about Alloy with e-commerce startups in its own portfolio.</p>
<p>Why $4 million? Per its founders, Alloy had barely dug into its original $1 million round when it raised more, but as the pair want to build out their go-to-market efforts, the capital made sense.</p>
<p>The founders said they intend to raise a Series A for Alloy, but that their current capital could float them for two or three years; their startup is a COVID baby, they joked, and after having some investors pull out of their pre-seed round, Alloy is conservative with its capital.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s talk growth. Per the pair, Q4 2020 was good for Alloy. That&#8217;s not surprising, as they serve e-commerce companies, firms that love holiday-boosted fourth-quarters. The founders told TechCrunch that during the fourth quarter, their in-house Slack channel set up to note payments, signups and other positive occurrences went off chronically.</p>
<p>The team today is the co-founders, three engineers, a designer and a marketer, spread across four time zones, with workers in America, India and the Philippines. Alloy intends to hire sales staff, new engineers and a customer success denizen.</p>
<p>Alloy&#8217;s software costs from $200 to $1,000 per month or more, depending on need. Let&#8217;s see how far it can scale on its new capital base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the COVID-19 era drags on, first-time founders need to find new ways to raise capital needed to keep startups offensive (and defense). Luckily, a trio of investors from top venture capital firms are joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=remotefundraising&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=remotefundraisingpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Justice on March 3</a> to make sense of different paths to funding.</p>
<p>The panel will include Sydney Thomas, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/precursor-ventures-promotes-sydney-thomas-its-first-hire-to-principal/">a principal at Precursor</a>, Brian Brackeen, a general partner at Lightship Capital, and Dr. Astrid J. Scholz, the founder and managing partner of Sphaera and the founding director of Zebras Unite.</p>
<p>We’ll ask about how these decision-makers advise founders to navigate the fundraising process, but with a twist. In this session, we’ll focus on the different, non-traditional paths one can take to getting their first checks. After all, not everyone has wealthy family and friends to milk $2 million out of on demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brackeen’s Lightship Capital is a Cincinnati-based VC firm that manages a $50 million fund dedicated to backing underrepresented founders. Brackeen himself has worked a lot in the artificial intelligence space, with a focus on face recognition technologies. His work exposed early dangers of algorithmic ethnic bias and racial bias in data sets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Astrid J. Scholz similarly wears many hats. She is the founder and managing partner of Sphaera, a system design and technology firm dedicated to co-creating infrastructure that helps data and capital solve big problems. Astrid is also the founding director and treasurer of the XXcelerate Fund, an Oregon-based revolving loan fund and mentorship program created for and by women entrepreneurs. Finally, Astrid is the founding director and treasurer of Zebras Unite, a community of investors and founders that are committed to creating an ethical, inclusive and sustainable approach to creating a business. <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/invest">The capital arm of Zebras Unite</a> uses non-traditional funding mechanisms to help companies secure financing.</p>
<p>Finally, Thomas is a check writer at Precursor Ventures, a firm dedicated to backing pre-seed companies that are working on products for the masses. Thomas also created a podcast, Be About It, where she profiles fascinating companies. Beyond this, you can find Thomas leading a variety of efforts and communities dedicated to early-stage founders, from Invanti, a startup generator in the midwest, to The Interrupters, a list that highlights investors committed to backing Black and LatinX founders.</p>
<p>They each have a lot going on, which means that the panel is going to be good fun and a healthy bit of debate between the changing macro environment in startup fundraising.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://trustlayer.io/"><b>TrustLayer</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which provides insurance brokers with risk management services via a SaaS platform, has raised $6.6 million in a seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstract Ventures led the financing, which also included participation from Propel Venture Partners, NFP Ventures, BoxGroup and Precursor Ventures. Interestingly, the startup also got some industry validation in the way of investors. Twenty of the top 100 insurance agencies in the U.S. (as well as some of their C-suite execs) put money in the round. Those agencies include Holmes Murphy, Heffernan and M3, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrokerTech Ventures (BTV), a group consisting of 13 tech-focused insurance agencies in the U.S. and 11 “top-tier” insurance companies, also invested in TrustLayer. The funding actually marked BTV’s first investment in a cohort member of its inaugural accelerator program. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustLayer co-founder and CEO John Fohr said the company was founded on the premise that verification of insurance and business credentials is a major pain point for millions of businesses. The process takes time and is not always trustworthy, which can lead to money lost in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help solve the problem, San Francisco-based TrustLayer has used robotic process automation (RPA) to build out what it describes as an automated and secure way for companies to verify insurance. It sells its software-as-a-service either through insurance brokers or directly to the companies themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustLayer says that companies that use its platform can automate the verification of insurance, licenses, and compliance documents of business partners such as vendors, subcontractors, suppliers, borrowers, tenants, ride-sharing and franchisees. (By verification of insurance, we mean confirming that a company is actually insured and not just pretending to be.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent traction includes companies working in the construction, property management, sports and hospitality industries. Insurance fraud is a real and expensive concern for companies working in those spaces, according to Fohr, who noted that the seed round was &#8220;heavily oversubscribed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustLayer’s long-term goal is to work with dozens of the largest brokers and carriers in the U.S. to build out a digital, real-time proof of insurance solution</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for businesses of all sizes, across all industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best analogy to describe what we do is calling us the Carta for insurance,” Fohr told TechCrunch. “We’re automating a process that is hugely painful and manual to help our carrier and broker partners provide better services to their customers and help companies reduce risk and make sure their business partners  have the right coverage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Mort, partner at Propel Venture Partners, said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly every business relationship requires one or both parties to prove they have the insurance required for engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustLayer comes in by “attacking a messy, data-rich, and unstructured problem within the insurance industry that is a major friction source for commerce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mort appreciates that TrustLayer is tackling the problem not by becoming the insurance broker, but by working </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the incumbents as a software solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Propel is no stranger to investing in fintech, having backed the likes of Coinbase, DocuSign, Guideline and Hippo. Mort acknowledges that much of the innovation in fintech has historically focused on the banking industry while the insurance industry has been slower to innovate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most interesting opportunities we see are around modernizing legacy infrastructure, reducing friction, and improving the customer experience,” he told TechCrunch. “More generally, insurtech companies are well-positioned for this market environment, where recurring revenue (or policies in this case) is valued, and more people are at home shopping for digital financial services. The need for insurance is only increasing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ellen Willadsen, chief innovation officer at Holmes Murphy and executive sponsor of BrokerTech Ventures, noted that TrustLayer’s expanded digital proof of coverage software “is seeing high adoption” among member agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustLayer will use its new capital to (naturally) some hiring of sales, marketing and engineering staff. It also plans to team up with The Institutes RiskStream Collaborative (considered to be one of the largest blockchain insurance consortiums in the U.S.) and insurance carriers to build out its digital proof of insurance offering.</span></p>
<p>Per a recent TechCrunch data analysis and some external data work on the insurtech venture capital market, it appears that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/">private insurtech investment</a> is matching the attention public investors are also giving the sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trades in the infamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">Reddit-basket of stocks</a> and trades are taking a pounding today, with GameStop down 52.7%, AMC Entertainment off 42.7%, the silver-squeeze flopping and more. CNBC has a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/the-other-reddit-trades-besides-gamestop-are-also-cratering-with-amc-silver-taking-big-hits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">longer list</a> if you want to feast your eyes on the carnage.</p>
<p>What a surprise that the thing that was always going to happen, has happened.</p>
<p>While it was quite honestly entertaining as hell to watch WallStreetBets go from cult-classic to internet hero overnight, tempting scads of new traders (check out how much Public has been growing <em>while</em> Robinhood raced to the top of app store charts) to try and take on the professional investing world, this was always going to be the result. Always.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why? Because the companies that Reddit&#8217;s legion of traders decided to pump were ultimately not selected for anything other than price plasticity. GameStop was picked because traders thought they could punish shorts, remember, not because it was going to bring a revolution to video game distribution. Like what Steam did precisely 8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make our point by way of comparison.</p>
<p>Tesla shares are up 3.7% today, as are the broader American stock markets. Tesla is up not because it is fairly valued, per se, but at least it&#8217;s a company that&#8217;s growing, makes money and has a good argument for what the future should look like. It&#8217;s hard to kill an idea based on something durable.</p>
<p>Compare the Tesla situation to GameStop. There&#8217;s little relation.</p>
<p>The brick-and-mortar game sales company has lots more room to fall. So does the movie theater chain suffering from the pandemic. But the original trader is still comfortably up. DeepFuckingValue, the Reddit trading icon, was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lae6j0/gme_yolo_update_feb_1_2021/">still up 2,800% yesterday</a>. That&#8217;s probably lower today, if he didn&#8217;t sell.</p>
<p>What worries me is all these dorks are getting torched today, after promising to stay in the trade yesterday when DeepFuckingValue updated the world on his epic trade:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2107224" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?w=515" alt="" width="515" height="522" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png 515w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-02-at-10.36.13-AM.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" /></p>
<p>Those folks probably weren&#8217;t up 2,800%.</p>
<p>Most of the people who are going to take a bath on the Reddit trades are regular folks: my friends, your siblings. Whereas professional money is probably making money on the way up and down.</p>
<p>This is how these things go. Gravity is real, and no matter how many times you shout <em>stonks</em> in the mirror, crying, while clutching your smartphone, it&#8217;s hard to keep a bag of shit in the air forever.</p>
<p>In 2021 maybe we don&#8217;t get 15 minutes of fame. There are so many different social platforms the very <em>idea</em> of 15 minutes of fame is outmoded; there are more slots than ever for everyone to build an audience. Perhaps instead the thing that the common person really wants is their 15 minutes of wealth. That feeling of safety and security and <em>having made it</em> that modern society so reserves for the wealthy few.</p>
<p>Which the stock market gave to a bunch of folks last week. And is taking away this week.</p>
<p><i>Andy Warhol is <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/andy-warhol-probably-never-said-his-celebrated-fame-line-180950456/">generally credited</a> with the 15 minutes of fame concept. Today, however, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> came up with the variation, and was kind enough to let me use it for this post.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some">announced today</a> that Amazon will be required to pay $61.7 million to settle charges that it withheld some customer tips from its Amazon Flex drivers over a two and half year period. According to the complaint against Amazon and its subsidiary Amazon Logistics, the company had advertised that it paid 100% of tips to drivers. But in reality, Amazon used the customer tips to cover the difference after it lowered the hourly rate &#8212; a change it didn&#8217;t inform drivers about, the complaint says.</p>
<p>The FTC also alleged that Amazon didn&#8217;t stop this behavior until it became aware of the FTC investigation in 2019.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/amazon_flex_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> (PDF) specifically has to do with the Amazon Flex service, launched in 2015, which allowed anyone to sign up to deliver Amazon packages to customers. These Flx drivers were paid an hourly rate for those deliveries and could also receive customer tips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the FAQ section of the Amazon Flex app, the company had promised drivers they would receive 100% of their tips, saying: <em>&#8220;For Prime Now, AmazonFresh, and store deliveries, the customer can choose to tip. You will receive 100% of the tips you earn while delivering with Amazon Flex.&#8221;</em> An earlier version of this document had also stated that Amazon <em>&#8220;will pass to you 100% of tips you earn,&#8221;</em> back in May 2018.</p>
<p>Amazon also promoted the tips benefits in ads recruiting drivers, where the company offered a rate of up to $18-25 per hour and the ability to &#8220;make more&#8221; via tips. And when drivers signed up for the Amazon Flex service, its terms also promised 100% of tips, the FTC complaint explains.</p>
<p>Despite the language being used, when Flex drivers used the app to accept their delivery gigs, they would be assigns delivery &#8220;blocks,&#8221; only some of which were tips-eligible. Initially, this included Prime Now but later expanded to include AmazonFresh and Amazon Restaurants. Those that weren&#8217;t eligible for tips were paid a flat rate. Meanwhile, customers using the Amazon app were encouraged to tip drivers through the app, which noted that &#8220;cash is not accepted upon delivery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Amazon from 2015 to 2016 paid drivers $18 per hour plus 100% of tips, as it claimed. But in 2016, it made changes to the program to adopt &#8220;variable base pay,&#8221; which ran over the course of two and a half years. During this time, Amazon would reduce its own contribution to drivers&#8217; pay to an algorithmically set, internal &#8220;base rate&#8221; using data it collected about average tips in the area. This base rate was often below the $18-$25 advertised rate. Then, instead of paying out 100% of tips to drivers, Amazon treated the bottom of the range as a guaranteed minimum and used drivers&#8217; tips to meet that minimum, the FTC says.</p>
<p>When Amazon made these changes, it didn&#8217;t ask for drivers&#8217; consent or otherwise inform them. It also had internal discussions where the company tried to decide what level of detail about earnings to actually show to drivers, knowing that the changes would reduce their earnings.</p>
<p>Drivers began to realize they were no longer receive 100% of tips and hundreds complained both to the company and publicly on social media. When reporters asked Amazon to respond to these complaints, the company continued to say that it paid 100% of tips &#8212; even as it internally acknowledged the situation represented &#8220;a huge PR risk to Amazon&#8221; and described it as a &#8220;reputation tinderbox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FTC says it issued a civil investigative demand to Amazon on May 23, 2019, and only afterwards &#8212; on August 22, 2019 &#8212; did Amazon announce an &#8220;updated earnings experience&#8221; to drivers, which was similar to the original compensation. In other words, it appears the investigation forced Amazon to stop the deceptive practice.</p>
<p>The FTC settlement includes a $61.7 million fine, which is the full amount of money withheld from drivers, the FTC says. This will be used to compensate drivers who can sign up to receive updates on the refund status here: <a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFTC/subscriber/new?topic_id=USFTC_155">https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFTC/subscriber/new?topic_id=USFTC_155.</a></p>
<p>“Rather than passing along 100 percent of customers’ tips to drivers, as it had promised to do, Amazon used the money itself,” said Daniel Kaufman, Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “Our action today returns to drivers the tens of millions of dollars in tips that Amazon misappropriated, and requires Amazon to get drivers’ permission before changing its treatment of tips in the future.”</p>
<p>In addition to the fine, the settlement also prohibits Amazon from making further changes to how drivers&#8217; tips are used as compensation without first obtaining their &#8220;express informed consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Amazon, however, the FTC fine is barely a slap on the hand, given the scale of its business. The company in the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/amazon-amzn-earnings-q3-2020.html"> third quarter</a> of 2020 pulled in $96.15 billion in revenue and earnings of $12.37 per share. It said revenue would climb to $112-121 billion in Q4, or annual growth of 28%-38%.</p>
<p>Fines like this, then, become just a cost of doing business and not a disincentive on unfair practices, as intended.</p>
<p>Amazon is not the only delivery business that has received complaints over messing with driver pay. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/">Instacart also found itself in hot water</a> over its own tipping debacle in 2019, which included a class action lawsuit over also taking driver tips to pay wages. Other companies, like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/why-instacart-doordash-workers-don-t-always-receive-tips-you-n965926">DoorDash</a>, <a href="https://www.gigworkersunitedmi.org/blog/shipt-is-stealing-tips">Shipt</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/delivery-startups-are-using-tips-to-fulfill-pay-promises">more</a>, have also faced complaints and even <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/11/25/bay-areas-doordash-to-pay-2-5-million-after-being-accused-of-stealing-drivers-tips/">lawsuits</a> over tips.</p>
<p>At the core of these issues is the fundamental <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/01/06/online-grocery-a-business-model-that-will-never-add-up/">problem of the shaky economics</a> of same-day and online grocery delivery businesses, with small margin items and additional costs associated with picking, labor and cold food storage. These costs require businesses operating in this space to charge premium subscriptions and delivery fees, and/or to mark up the cost of the items over in-store prices in order to make money. But even still, they often feel the need to tap into another income stream by taking driver tips.</p>
<p>Tips, of course, are never given to sustain a business &#8212; they&#8217;re meant to benefit an individual worker.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Amazon says it disagreed with the FTC complaint but glad it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we disagree that the historical way we reported pay to drivers was unclear, we added additional clarity in 2019 and are pleased to put this matter behind us,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson said. &#8220;Amazon Flex delivery partners play an important role in serving customers every day, which is why they earn among the best in the industry at over $25 per hour on average.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, which launched more than a decade ago, has sold courses to 50 million students through its digital learning platform. But <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210113005273/en/Udemy-Expands-Executive-Team-With-Key-Hire ">new president</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregsbrown">Greg Brown</a> sees “exponential growth” opportunities in doubling down on its enterprise arm, which currently has over 7,000 customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The shift within Udemy has been brewing for years, but recent tailwinds have shifted the way the business closes contracts.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a phone interview, Brown said <a href="https://business.udemy.com/">Udemy for Business</a>, the company’s corporate learning arm, &#8220;blew through $100 million ARR,&#8221; a metric it announced in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;One hundred million dollars was very conservative,&#8221; Brown said. While he wouldn’t share the latest metrics, he hinted that revenue had grown around 90%, which would put Udemy for Business’ new trajectory around $200 million in ARR. That’s a solid bump, considering it took five years for the arm to hit $100 million ARR, and a much smaller time frame to essentially double it.</p>
<p>Udemy declined to confirm the new ARR total, instead opting to share a slew of other growth metrics to indicate growth, including the fact that it has seen more than 480 million course enrollments and owns over 155,000 courses. The startup said that it has 40 million students, but in 2019 the business said it had 50 million users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/filing-online-learning-marketplace-udemy-is-raising-up-to-100m-at-a-3-32b-valuation/">based on a previous interview.</a> When asked about the user drop, Udemy said that &#8220;we&#8217;ve made some changes to our metrics as we grow as a company to better reflect user engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The opportunity that the company sees has really forced us to reallocate resources and strategy,” Brown said. While Udemy will “continue to invest” in its direct-to-consumer business, it sees bigger potential in its enterprise product.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car insurance startup MetroMile said it has fixed a security flaw on its website that allowed a hacker to obtain driver&#8217;s license numbers.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based insurance startup disclosed the security breach in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819035/000121390021005784/ea134248-8k_insuacquis2.htm?=1819035-01022021">its latest 8-K filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>MetroMile said a bug in the quote form and application process on the company&#8217;s website allowed the hacker to &#8220;obtain personal information of certain individuals, including individuals&#8217; driver&#8217;s license numbers.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear exactly how the form allowed the hacker to obtain driver&#8217;s license numbers or how many individuals had their driver&#8217;s license numbers obtained.</p>
<p>The disclosure added: &#8220;Metromile immediately took steps to contain and remediate the issue, including by releasing software fixes, notified its insurance carrier, and has continued its ongoing operations. Metromile is working diligently with security experts and legal counsel to ascertain how the incident occurred, identify additional containment and remediation measures, and notify affected individuals, law enforcement, and regulatory bodies, as appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick Chen, a spokesperson for MetroMile, said that the company has so far confirmed that driver&#8217;s license numbers were accessed, but that the &#8220;investigation is still ongoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>MetroMile has not disclosed the security incident on its website or its social channels. Chen said the company plans to notify affected individuals of the incident.</p>
<p>News of the security incident landed as the company <a href="https://www.metromile.com/blog/ryan-graves-saltwater-investment-metromile/">confirmed</a> a $50 million investment from former Uber executive Ryan Graves, who will also join the company&#8217;s board. It comes just weeks after the auto insurance startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">announced</a> it was planning to go public via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">a special-purpose acquisition company</a> — or SPAC — in a $1.3 billion deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are some additions to the TechCrunch team that I&#8217;m happy to announce.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten Korosec</a>, who has been with us for more than two years, was promoted to Transportation Editor.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An &#8220;anonymously&#8221;-led startup called <a href="https://millions.app/">Millions</a> has raised a $3 million seed round for its fintech company that&#8217;s currently giving away free money through its Twitter account. The concept, inspired by the likes of YouTuber <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dobrik">David Dobrik</a>, is partly aimed at attracting attention for the new company but is also setting the stage for a forthcoming business model of sorts, where brands could participate in giveaways more directly.</p>
<p>The idea of brand and cash giveaways is not a new one, of course. Outside of social media personalities and traditional sweepstakes like Publishers Clearing House, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/hq-trivia-shuts-down/">mobile game HQ Trivia</a> more recently had tried to <a href="https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/inside-hqs-attempt-grow-ad-business/">integrate brand giveaways</a> in an attempt to draw players to its live trivia games. But HQ Trivia couldn&#8217;t maintain an audience after the novelty wore off and eventually shut down, after also dealing with internal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/14/trivia-game-of-thrones/">strife</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/16/hq-trivia-and-vine-co-founder-colin-kroll-found-dead-of-suspected-overdose/">tragedy</a>.</p>
<p>Millions has a different idea. Instead of weekly live games, users follow the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/millions">@millions</a>, which either does a drop of some sort or gives away money to its followers every month. This month, for example, the account is launching its &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aSE-bawQ8Y&amp;feature=youtu.be">million dollar sweepstakes</a>.&#8221; Users follow @millions on Twitter, visit <a href="https://millions.app/">Millions.app</a>, the enter 6 numbers. If all 6 match, they win $1 million*. <em>(See details below). </em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Next month, the startup will launch a game called &#8220;are you my number neighbor?&#8221; where users will enter their phone number on a website, and if it&#8217;s just a digit off from the phone number on the site, the user wins $100,000.</p>
<p>These stunts &#8212; apparently just giving away investor cash &#8212; are meant to raise brand awareness and acquire customers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think about customer acquisition costs &#8212; and this is a little bit controversial &#8212; people just give money to Facebook or Instagram, or Apple or Google. The money goes straight to a social network and not the people,&#8221; explained a Millions co-founder, who asked to remain anonymous. &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to get the people, but they&#8217;re not giving the people the money. The Millions way is really giving the people the money. We don&#8217;t need to run advertisements. We&#8217;re giving the money directly to the people, and hopefully, they follow our ecosystem, subscribe for updates, and they&#8217;ll see the future launch,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the larger plan for Millions is to transfer the customers it acquires through the games to the fintech play, which will also have something to do with winning money.</p>
<p>TechCrunch agreed to not reveal the co-founders&#8217; name during a discussion to learn what the startup was up to, as they said they wanted to keep the game playful and anonymous for the time being. But we&#8217;re not breaking any agreements by pointing to what&#8217;s easy-to-access, publicly available data. We found the company, Mycard Inc. is referenced on the Millions website&#8217;s <a href="https://millions.app/">Terms</a> as the legal entity behind this endeavour. That same company is on <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1837649/000183764920000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">this SEC filing</a> for a $3 million fundraise in December 2020. The filing lists two names: Kieran and Rory O&#8217;Reilly. These are the same names as the brothers <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/skipping-school-to-become-tech-giants/">behind gifs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Investors in the startup&#8217;s seed round included Giant Ventures, 8VC, Supernode, Supernode, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Italic CEO Jeremy Cai, Allbirds co-founder and CEO Joey Zwillinger, Casper co-founders Neil Parikh and Luke Sherwin, MSCHF head of strategy and growth Daniel Greenberg, CEO of Deel Alex Bouaziz, CEO of Hellosaurus James Ruben, CEO of Beek Pamela Valdes, PM at Facebook (for the Payments Gateway team) Luis Vargas, co-founder of Block Renovations Koda Wang, CEO of Nebula Genomics Kamal Obbad, plus some Warby Parker and Harry&#8217;s co-founders and execs (Dave Gilboa, Neil Blumenthal, Jeff Raider), and other fintech angels.</p>
<p>A few investors also agreed to vouch for Millions on the record, and hinted at the MyCard product to come, which will reward customers for everyday behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;This company is creating delight from what would otherwise be the mundane, everyday necessity of swiping a credit card. We invested in Millions because they will spark joy in people&#8217;s lives, and think the traditional points model of accumulating hard-to-use airline and hotel points is tired, and ripe for reinvention,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/">Allbirds</a> co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jzwillinger/">Joey Zwillinger</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millions is building an incredibly loyal audience through an unparalleled, engaging customer experience and the $1M giveaway is only the tip of the iceberg of what&#8217;s to come. These are some of the strongest founders I know and have truly captured lightning in a bottle,&#8221; said <a href="http://italic.com/">Italic</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyhcai">Jeremy Cai.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I invested in Millions because the trend is clear &#8211; people love winning money.It’s clear that there’s something going on here. Millions is dedicated to giving away money in crazy ways and I’m happy to be involved,&#8221; said <a href="https://mschf.xyz/">MSCHF</a> head of strategy and growth, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-greenberg-4aab97115/">Daniel Greenberg</a>.</p>
<p>Millions&#8217; arrival, however, comes at a time when people are desperate for money due to the economic downturn driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of government assistance. The pandemic has exacerbated the class divide, leading people (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-pope-francis-archive-capitalism-bcde0053314e65612add0709fada5519">including</a> the Pope) to question whether capitalism has failed. It has fueled the &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2005082-gamestop-stock-surge">eat the rich</a>&#8221; ethos behind the GameStop frenzy. And this situation has added a darker layer to otherwise do-gooder activities, like Dobrick&#8217;s <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/these-tweets-about-david-dobriks-coronavirus-giveaway-will-make-you-emotional-22846125">stunts</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lexylately?lang=en">Lexy Kadey&#8217;s TikTok &#8220;Venmo Challenges</a>,&#8221; where she tips waitstaff and fast food workers hundreds or even a thousand dollars and films them breaking down in relief.</p>
<p>Millions&#8217; co-founder acknowledges we&#8217;re in a time of need, but also argues that&#8217;s why the product makes sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about what&#8217;s going on in the world right now &#8212; with the pandemic and the 99% versus the 1% &#8212; people are looking for a) hope and b) money,&#8221; they said. &#8220;If you can combine a product that has two of those things, you&#8217;re giving people fun, excitement, and something to look forward to&#8230;I think that&#8217;s really inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aSE-bawQ8Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><em>*Note: Like many sweepstakes, you&#8217;re playing for a &#8220;chance&#8221; to win. But in this case, $10,000 is a guaranteed Grand Prize win for one person. The Millions website lists the digital promotions company <a href="https://www.rtm.com/">Realtime Media</a> as being involved in helping manage the game. However, the insurance provider that insures the program is actually HCC.  </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever applied for a mortgage, you know it’s one of the most painful processes out there. Keeping up with payments and dealing with customer service over the course of the loan is no picnic either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that big bucks are being poured into the space with the goal of making the process easier, more digital and more transparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, <a href="https://valon.com/">Valon</a>, a tech-enabled mortgage servicer, announced this morning it has raised $50 million in a Series A round of funding &#8212; which is large for its stage even by today’s standards.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the round for the New York-based company formerly known as Peach Street. Returning backers Jefferies Financial Group, New Residential Investment Corporation – an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC – and 166 2nd LLC (<a href="https://massinvestordatabase.com/publicfirm.php?name=166+2nd+Financial+Services">the family office of WeWork</a> co-founder Adam Neumann) also participated in the financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valon previously raised $3.2 million from seed investors such as serial entrepreneur Kevin Ryan’s Alley Corp, Soros, Kairos, and Zigg Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Wang, Eric Chiang and Jon Hsu founded Valon in June 2019 with the mission of breaking up what it sees as “a monopoly in the market,” with “the largest mortgage servicing software company” (software giant Black Knight) controlling more than half of all U.S. residential loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re on the cusp of a mortgage foreclosure crisis comparable to 2008, and the majority of homeowners struggling to make their loan payments are unaware of their options,” Valon CEO Wang said. “This stranglehold has driven servicing costs up nearly 250% in the past decade, and the fees are passed on directly to the borrower.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrent with the raise, Valon recently got the green light from Fannie Mae to service its government sponsored home loans. (For the unacquainted, servicing loans means doing things like collecting payments on behalf of a lender). The approval will only continue to fuel Valon&#8217;s rapid growth, according to Wang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went from no contracts committed to $10 billion in mortgages committed to be serviced in one year,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valon operates in 49 states, and expects to add New York this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a former investor in mortgage servicing space, Wang was frustrated by “the lack of service” provided by other servicers. So he teamed up with Chiang and Hsu, who had prior product and engineering experience at Google and Twilio, to launch Valon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s cloud-native platform aims to deliver what it describes as a borrower-oriented experience. Lenders also can request access to real-time API data feeds to view performance of their borrowers and reconcile transaction data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike mortgage originators, which lend money to the borrower, a mortgage servicer interfaces with the borrower for the duration of their loan – and that can be anywhere from 15 to 30 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This includes things like collecting payments on behalf of the lender and providing assistance and guidance to the borrower in moments of stress,” Wang said. “Traditional mortgage servicers use antiquated technology and provide poor service to borrowers. Valon looks to change that dynamic by providing transparency and full self-service capabilities to homeowner</span>s.<b>”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also claims that its technology has the potential to reduce mortgage servicing costs by up to 50% by vertically integrating the entire process. Its platform is built on Google Cloud with security as a “first-principle” with features such as default encryption and intrusion detection, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of Americans<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-bailout-there-is-going-to-be-complete-chaos-mortgage-ceo.html"> stopped paying their mortgages</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2020 due to the economic strain of the coronavirus pandemic. This led to requests for forbearance (postponement of payments) and foreclosure moratoriums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic highlighted the stress in the market and greatly accelerated the need for a new age mortgage servicer,” Wang said. “Homeowners faced a great deal of financial stress and had difficulty getting the right option and assistance from existing servicers due to their antiquated technology and inability to process requests&#8230; In 2021 we will see forbearance and foreclosure leniency come to an end and this need will be even more acute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://twitter.com/astrange">Angela Strange</a>, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz who joined Valon’s board in mid-2020, says Valon has built a mobile-first mortgage servicer from the ground up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Homeowners are faced with clumsy websites, call centers, and often misinformation,” she said in a written statement. “In Valon, they have a trusted software driven advisor who can provide clear, transparent, regulatory compliant information in good times and bad &#8211; without needing to pick up the phone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fannie Mae approval only serves as further validation of the platform the team has created, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valon plans to use its new capital to triple headcount to about 100 by year’s end as well as to acquire more mortgage servicing rights (MSR) contracts to service.</span></p>

<p>Atlassian chief revenue officer Cameron Deatsch says that previously the company had offered a free tier and then standard and premium level paid tiers. &#8220;And now this cloud Enterprise Edition will be our highest tier, and what this will allow is for the most complex deployments, the largest customers who need unlimited scale, the customers that have all the security and regulatory requirements, data residency, you name it, &#8212; that is what we&#8217;re launching starting [today],&#8221; Deatsch told me.</p>
<p>What the enterprise tier delivers is unlimited instances across the Atlassian product line for each enterprise customer. That means a big company with multiple divisions could, for instance, have 20 instances of Jira and Confluence deployed with one for each division and a central management console.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While the company is supporting existing on-prem server customers until 2024, the idea is to now move them to the cloud and this offering should help. One thing we have clearly seen is that the pandemic has accelerated the move to the cloud by companies of every size, and this should encourage the company&#8217;s largest customers to make the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, the demand was there, which was great to see, but we actually had this huge pipeline of our largest customers, basically trying to build their plan over the next couple of years to get to our cloud. The general availability of our Enterprise Edition is going to accelerate that even more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a move the company has been working towards for some time, but it really began to take shape when they shifted their operations to AWS and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-journey/"> rebuilt the entire stack as a set of microservices</a> beginning in 2016. This was the first step towards being able to handle the increased kinds of workloads an enterprise tier would require.</p>
<p>The company reported earnings at the end of last month with revenue of $501.4 million up 23% YoY with over 11,000 net new subscribers, a record for the company. The new enterprise tier won&#8217;t help with new customer volume, but it should help with overall revenue as more customers look for cloud solutions and pricing that meets their needs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Could this IPO prove that there is lucrative space in the market for more dating products?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">On the heels of private companies Robinhood and Databricks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">each</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">raising $1 billion or more yesterday</a>, Bumble is out with a new IPO filing this morning indicating that it wants to raise 10 figures as well.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The relationship-finding service where women reach out first will go public on the heels of strong public debuts in December by companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">like Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">DoorDash </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">C3.ai</a> with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/after-soaring-above-23b-qualtrics-founder-and-ceo-reflect-on-a-stellar-debut/"> Qualtrics</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">and Poshmark</a> lighting the way in January.</p>

So this won&#8217;t be entirely clean or simple.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll get through it. Here&#8217;s what we want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple and diluted valuations for Bumble at its current IPO price range.</li>
<li>What sort of multiples Bumble expects public investors to pay for its shares.</li>
<li>How those stack up compared to Match Group&#8217;s own numbers.</li>
<li>And, finally, what the Bumble IPO could mean for dating and relationship-focused startups; could this IPO prove that there is lucrative space in the market for more dating products?</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#8217;s get to work, starting with Bumble&#8217;s valuation.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s a bird! It&#8217;s a plane! It&#8217;s a very valuable bee?</h2>
<p>Bumble&#8217;s simple valuation is just that to calculate, a doddle. At $28 to $30 per share, and Bumble noting that it expects to have 108,384,634 shares outstanding after its IPO, including its full underwriters&#8217; option, the company would be worth $3.03 billion up to $3.25 billion.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a bit too simple. Bumble&#8217;s share count is actually quite a lot higher. For example, if we assume the &#8220;exchange of all Common Units held by the Pre-IPO Common Unitholders,&#8221; then the company&#8217;s share count rises to 189,548,952. At that share count, Bumble is worth $5.31 billion to $5.69 billion. That&#8217;s a lot more!</p>
<p>Now things get actually tricky. Our last share count did not take into its confines &#8220;any shares of Class A common stock issuable in exchange for as-converted Incentive Units or upon settlement of certain other interests.&#8221; So, what are those?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Own a Tesla Model S or Model X? It might have a recall, and it&#8217;s serious.</p>
<p>Tesla today issued one of its largest recalls to date, covering roughly 135,000 Model S and Model X. The touchscreen is the concern.</p>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the touchscreen in these vehicles can fail when a memory chips runs out of storage capacity, which can cause a host of failures, including affecting turn signals and defrosters, and the rearview camera. This failure can also affect Tesla&#8217;s self-driving Autopilot functionality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INRM-EA20003-11321.pdf">NHTSA explained the department&#8217;s findings</a> to Tesla in a mid-January letter. According to NHTSA&#8217;s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI), the affected vehicle&#8217;s memory chips are to blame. The 8GB chip eventually wears out, and the only remedy is a replacement, the letter says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-recalls-roughly-135-000-vehicles-over-touch-screen-failures-11612270332">According to the WSJ</a>, Tesla disagrees that the issue is a failure, though the automaker is recalling a select amount of vehicles to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle&#8217;s entire useful life,&#8221; Tesla said in the letter.</p>
<p>The vehicles covered by the recall include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 and Model X vehicles made between 2016 and 2018. The affected vehicles are equipped with NVIDIA Tegra 3 computing platforms and an 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005693/en/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly">today announced plans</a> to acquire alcohol delivery service Drizly. The approximately $1.1 billion deal includes stock and cash and is expected to close in the first half of the year. The plan will build Drizly’s marketplace directly into the Uber Eats app, though the company notes that it will maintain Drizly as a standalone app offering as well, for the time being.</p>
<p>Certainly there&#8217;s a marketplace fit here. Uber provides the underlying ride hailing and delivery technologies, while Drizly can help the company expand Uber Eats into an even more potentially lucrative service.</p>
<p>&#8220;[CEO Cory Rellas] and his amazing team have built Drizly into an incredible success story, profitably growing gross bookings more than 300 percent year-over-year,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. &#8220;By bringing Drizly into the Uber family, we can accelerate that trajectory by exposing Drizly to the Uber audience and expanding its geographic presence into our global footprint in the years ahead.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service has experienced a steady roll out in markets across the U.S. Though local liquor laws have offered something of a hurdle for expansion. Last month,<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/drizly-brings-on-demand-adult-beverage-delivery-to-atlanta-following-recent-statewide-legalization-of-alcohol-e-commerce-301200960.html#:~:text=All%20Products-,Drizly%20Brings%20On%2DDemand%20Adult%20Beverage%20Delivery%20To%20Atlanta%20Following,Legalization%20Of%20Alcohol%20E%2DCommerce&amp;text=BOSTON%2C%20Jan.%205%2C%202021,is%20now%20available%20in%20Atlanta."> it added Atlanta</a> to the list, teaming up with a dozen or so local markets and liquor stores to expand delivery. Like Uber Eats, Drizly teams with local merchants in the markets it services. The company says its services reach more than 1,400 cities in North America at last count. No doubt pandemic-related shutdowns have also gone a ways toward expanding the appeal of alcohol delivery.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Boston-based Drizly has raised just under $120 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/drizly">per Crunchbase</a>. That includes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/online-liquor-store-drizly-just-landed-34-5-million-in-fresh-funding/"> a $34.5 million Series C</a> back in late-2018. More recently, the service was hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/drizly-data-breach/">with a data breach</a>. The breach, which was disclosed last July, was believed to have impacted up to 2.5 million accounts.</p>
<p>Uber says it expects around 90% of the payment to Drizly stockholders to be made in Uber stock, with the remainder coming via cash. The deal will be is pending standard regulatory approval.</p>
