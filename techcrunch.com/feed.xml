										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lightspeed China Partners, the China-focused vehicle of Lightspeed Venture Partners, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005690/en/Lightspeed-China-Partners-Raises-920-Million-with-Focus-on-Green-Tech-Deep-Tech-and-Enterprise-Technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Tuesday it has closed the largest fundraising rounds in its history. The new injection came under three years after its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/02/lightspeed-china-560-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> last raise in early 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The capital went towards two funds: Lightspeed China Partners V with $460 million for early-stage startups and Lightspeed China Partners Select II with $460 million for growth-stage opportunities. Both will be seeking investments in green tech, deep tech, enterprise tech, health tech and consumer tech, the firm said.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners, rooted in Silicon Valley, started in 1999 and has gradually extended its footprint to Israel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/lightspeed-raises-275-million-fund-for-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India</a>, Europe, Southeast Asia and China, where it <a href="https://www.36kr.com/p/1084169383085056" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began investing in 2006</a>. Lightspeed China has since built up a local investment team like its counterparts IDG and Sequoia. In the past five years, the firm saw a number of notable IPOs, including e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinduoduo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/19/meituan-dianpings-ipo-off-to-a-good-start-as-shares-climb-7-on-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meituan</a>, freight matching platform Full Truck Alliance, and electric vehicle upstart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/ev-upstart-xpeng-is-expanding-beyond-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xpeng</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve written some of its growth-stage portfolio companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hesai</a>, a major lidar maker in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/laiye-rpa-50-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laiye</a>, which aspires to be China&#8217;s Uipath, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, one of the meat replacement startups that have emerged in China recently.</p>
<p>Alongside its landmark raise, Lightspeed China also added five new partners. Jia Zhu, Francis Kao and Jason Wang were promoted to partners. It also brought in two new partners &#8212; Wei Cai, who was previously responsible for Alibaba&#8217;s investment in deep tech, and Daniel Sun, who jointly led investments in the consumer and TMT (technology, media, and telecom) sectors at the China Renaissance New Economy Fund.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s two new funds were &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221;, which is &#8220;evidence of the strong support garnered from returning and new institutional limited partners across the U.S., Europe and Asia,&#8221; said James Mi, who helped Google <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmi1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build its China offshoot</a> before founding Lightspeed China.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our society is facing the significant challenges of climate change and inequality, we believe it is important to focus on startup companies with innovative products and services that can bring positive impact to the world,&#8221; said Mi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW couldn&#8217;t mark the 50th anniversary of its high-performance M division with any ol&#8217; concept vehicle. Instead, the German automaker tapped into a rock star aesthetic that would make David Lee Roth proud with a plug-in hybrid concept that merges V8 power with next-level M design.</p>
<p>The XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept — suitably codenamed &#8220;Rock Star&#8221; internally (we&#8217;ll get into that later) — is the second M-only vehicle ever.</p>
<p>The XM SUV, which TechCrunch got a peek at earlier this month in Los Angeles, will not end up in the concept car dustbin. After some massaging to comply with regulations, it will go into production in 2022. And according to the automaker, the XM SUV will be pretty close to the outrageous concept shown off in Los Angeles earlier this month. Which is good news for extroverts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240417" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The BMW XM takes cues from the automaker&#8217;s SUV lineup and M vehicle legacy, but supplements those designs with bravado. The lines are more aggressive. The rear end of the concept, which has cat-like LED lights, a BMW logo milled into the glass and an M quad-exhaust, is unlike any other vehicle in the automaker&#8217;s line. Instead of the pipes situated horizontally, the hexagonal exhaust tips are mounted vertically on either side of a wide diffuser. Up front, the large kidney grilles get their very own LED-outlined treatment.</p>
<p>Everything about the vehicle screams, &#8220;Look at me!&#8221; — which is exactly what the automaker was going for.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240457" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240457" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240457 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept back" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_04.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The feedback from our customers is that they really love our cars. But then the next step is they would like to have even more expressive luxury in the cars,&#8221; Franciscus van Meel, chairman of the board of BMW M, said during an unveiling of the vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These customers, according to BMW, are extroverted, expressive, non-conformists that would likely cross-shop the XM against the Lamborghini Urus and Mercedes G-Class, although BMW hasn&#8217;t shared pricing as of yet.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the interior, which somehow manages to outshine the &#8220;look at me&#8221; exterior.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240459" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240459" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240459 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240459" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The exterior is essentially a mid-2000s Toyota Camry compared to what&#8217;s going on inside. The front row is covered in what BMW calls a &#8220;vintage brown&#8221; leather and is geared specifically for performance and the driver&#8217;s orientation. The rear seat? Imagine Russel Brand&#8217;s bedroom and that&#8217;s what BMW has done to the XM for rear passengers. The back seat and floor are covered in blue and green velvet respectively meant to convey a lounge. All that&#8217;s missing is a lava lamp and a bowl of M&amp;Ms with all the brown ones removed.</p>
<p>Above the driver and passengers is a crystal structure headliner. It&#8217;s indirectly illuminated from the sides and when lit up, it really does feel like a piece of art, or at least similar to a laser show of a planetarium.</p>
<p>If BMW can get the lights to sync up to Tame Impala&#8217;s latest album, it&#8217;s got a winner on its hands with a certain set of music and herbal-supplement fans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240460" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_xm.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240460" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240460 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_xm.gif" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept gif" width="680" height="382" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The rolling music club is a merging of the automaker&#8217;s V8 and plug-in hybrid technology. Together, the powertrain outputs 750 horsepower and 737 pound-feet of torque. BMW didn&#8217;t share information about battery capacity but did say it&#8217;s targeting an EPA-tested range of 30 miles in EV-only mode. Not exactly on par with offerings from Toyota. But, more than enough to quietly pull away from the venue without sparking too much interest. Unless of course, anyone notices the design and shiny kidney grilles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240461" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240461" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2240461 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg" alt="BMW XM SUV plug-in hybrid concept grille" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BMW_Concept_XM_03.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>According to the head of BMW M design, Marcus Syring, the XM was always going to be something special. The BMW board specifically asked the designers to shock them with something they weren&#8217;t expecting.</p>
<p>&#8220;BMW is continuously doing these specific high-tech models and really exploring new areas with the i3 and i8 but also with the iX,&#8221; Syring told TechCrunch at the end of the evening. &#8220;We are exploring something. It&#8217;s the same with that car (XM). It&#8217;s very unique and we are trying out new things.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an industry that regularly calls on rock stars and their music to help sell a vehicle, BMW&#8217;s M division built the vehicle equivalent of former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth. It&#8217;s loud, flamboyant, ready to &#8220;bring it,&#8221; and at the end of the day, happy to embrace you in velvet.</p>

							<span class="byline__author-name">Marjorie Radlo-Zandi</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Marjorie Radlo-Zandi is an entrepreneur, board member, mentor to startups and <a href="https://www.jazzas.com/">angel investor</a> who shows early-stage businesses how to build and successfully scale their businesses.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re an entrepreneur looking to grow your business internationally, expanding into multiple countries can exponentially impact your bottom line business and brand, allowing you to grow efficiently. Scaling your business beyond borders, however, is a path riddled with bumps and obstacles.</p>
<p>In my previous role leading a food diagnostics company for more than 20 years, I guided its growth from one country to doing business in over a hundred. Our firm became a worldwide player and influencer in food safety diagnostics, and in a matter of years, 65% of our business was outside the U.S. We also achieved 38% market share globally.</p>
<p>We succeeded because we secured data through market research and used the data to inform our global strategy.</p>
<p>Here are a few key strategies to achieving this kind of international growth.</p>
<h2>Research your market</h2>
<p>The first step is to check relevant market research. You may need to hire a research firm to accurately gauge the geographic market for your industry and product. Be sure to tap into research that drills down into the intricacies of your vertical market and separates out the various geographic markets. I recommend research companies such as <a href="https://www.frost.com/">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://global.nielsen.com/global/en/">Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research firms can detail the exact market size of specific geographic areas, competitors, market dynamics, expected growth rates and expected revenue — usually over 10 years. This data is critical when planning for an international rollout.</p>
<p>Market research reports are easily accessible online either as abstracts or the full report for a fee. If you want a custom report, research firms typically take 90-120 days or more to deliver a comprehensive report.</p>
<p>If you operate in a niche, this information is worth its weight in gold, and I recommend hiring a professional to secure the information you need. A customized market research report costs generally from $20,000 to $50,000, depending on the industry and market research organization.</p>
<p>As an example, the company I ran engaged a market researcher to determine which international market we should prioritize, and the present and future product demand for our current and future product pipeline. We also readjusted our product pipeline based on the demand in key international markets.</p>
<h2>Prioritize international rollout based on ROI</h2>
<p>In order to achieve international growth, you need to plan based on ROI estimates.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Armageddon Now&#8217;: NASA launches mission to test asteroid deflection</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/armageddon-now-nasas-asteroid-deflecting-dart-mission-launches-tonight/">NASA is planning on crashing a spacecraft into a small asteroid</a> to test whether this will meaningfully change its trajectory, in case Earth ever faces threat from a nearby space rock that wants to smashy-smash.</p>
<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission took off Wednesday early morning to much fanfare, and it&#8217;s not difficult to understand why: This is the first time humans have ever attempted to change the path of an asteroid! Thankfully, the target asteroid is very, very far away and poses no danger to us &#8212; so far away that it&#8217;ll take the spacecraft around 10 months to even reach it, let alone execute its mission.</p>
<p>Right before the spacecraft reaches its target &#8212; the smaller of two asteroids that are traveling in a binary system &#8212; it&#8217;ll have to very precisely execute a number of burns and thruster firings to ensure it actually collides with the smaller space rock. The impact should change the orbital speed of the asteroid by less than 1%, but that should be enough to alter its orbital period by several minutes.</p>
<p>“Planetary Defense has been working on the problem for, really, decades,” explained Thomas Zurbuchen, head of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “It’s time to start getting together this toolset — it’s getting important for all our stakeholders. It’s really been in the last five years or so that the program has increased its support. And the target has been around for at least five years before that — people were talking about how this is really perfect, we can view its success from the ground, there’s no need for a second investigation.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Post-launch debriefs with Astra&#8217;s Chris Kemp and Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck</h2>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck and Astra&#8217;s Chris Kemp each gave separate post-launch debriefs to reporters this week, where they shared more details about what&#8217;s next for their respective space companies.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Astra:</strong> The company recently experienced a major win when it successfully launched a rocket to orbit for the first time. Astra, which went public via a SPAC merger this summer, delivered a payload for the U.S. Space Force as part of the department’s Space Test Program.</p>
<p>According to Kemp, the company is now ready to commence commercial operations using its small launch vehicle (Rocket 3.3) and begin flight testing a larger rocket variation (Rocket 4.0) next year.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/astra-moves-full-steam-ahead-after-successful-orbital-launch-looks-to-test-rocket-4-0-next-year/">“This is really hard and all it takes is one thing to go wrong,”</a> he said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Video of our first orbital launch <a href="https://t.co/t0FzJRhJsL">pic.twitter.com/t0FzJRhJsL</a></p>
<p>— Chris Kemp (@Kemp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kemp/status/1462795715835412481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to <strong>Rocket Lab</strong>, which scored its own win last week when it successfully recovered a rocket booster for the third time. The next step in its recovery program: catching the booster in mid-air using a helicopter.</p>
<p>This has always been the ultimate aim of Rocket Lab&#8217;s reusability program, and the company has spent a lot of time preparing for this mission, which should take place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/rocket-lab-aims-to-catch-electron-rocket-booster-mid-air-with-a-helicopter-next-year/">sometime in the first half of next year, Beck said</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, around half of Electron launches will be reusable versus expendable, he added. This is different than the company&#8217;s plans for its forthcoming Neutron rocket, which is designed to be reusable each time it flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful for all the reusability work that we&#8217;re doing on Electron today because there&#8217;s just so many lessons to learn that you can&#8217;t learn in a wind tunnel, you can&#8217;t learn in analysis, you just have to go and fly,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;Electron has been a spectacular piece for us to learn so much about reentry, so much about controlling that reentry and managing those thermal loads, because reusability is not a structural problem to solve. It&#8217;s a thermal problem to solve and a control problem. And Electron has really enabled us to hone that.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After a fun chat about Jack Dorsey's decision on Equity, we hashed out our views about the value of founders who remain in leadership long after their companies have reached maturity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced today his plans to step down as CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">he didn’t go quietly</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being &#8216;founder-led,'&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Ultimately I believe that&#8217;s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey added that he believes “it&#8217;s critical that a company can stand on its own, free of its founder&#8217;s influence or direction.”</p>
<p>We found this slightly rich, since Dorsey, who is also the CEO and co-founder of fintech giant Square, was Twitter&#8217;s first CEO before he stepped down and returned to the role after the five-year reign of Dick Costolo. That’s hardly a <em>lack</em> of founder control.</p>
<p>Still, his comments are pretty counternarrative.</p>
<p>In today’s founder-friendly environment, venture investors often bet on early teams based entirely on their to-date product progress, and founders are increasingly likely to stay at the helm even after their companies have gone public. “[T]here aren’t many founders that choose their company over their own ego,” Dorsey wrote.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/">a fun chat about the Dorsey decision on Equity</a>, we hashed out our views about the value of founders who remain in leadership roles long after their companies have reached maturity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm:</a> A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas:</a> A reset would rewrite how VCs and entrepreneurs do business</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda Silberling:</a> Founders aren&#8217;t rock stars</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex Wilhelm: A call to return to the old normal from the new normal</h2>
<p>What’s somewhat incredible about this Dorsey take is that it’s utterly uncontroversial — 15 years ago. Today, sure, but that’s just a mark of how much things have changed.</p>
<p>Recall that investors made the Google founders bring on a business person to be their company’s CEO. You’ve heard of Eric Schmidt. It was commonplace in prior venture eras for founders to step aside from the top job once their company hit scale, as the thinking went that there were folks better suited for the role of scaling a tech company than founders.</p>
<p>What happened to that perspective? Two things. First, major returns from select founder-led businesses. Facebook has done well in financial terms under a single leader. You can throw in a few other names to the mix as well; Coinbase and Airbnb come to mind.</p>
<p>But more important is that venture capitalists have lost much of their prior influence. Gone are the days when VCs could sit in their suburban <del>office parks</del> throne rooms and force founders to come to them. Even more, the explosion in capital available to founders has rendered the core venture conceit — having money to invest — to commodity status. This means that venture folks can’t boss founders around as much as they once could thanks to lower leverage.</p>
<p>So founders get to stay in charge of their companies for as long as they want, often ensconced in a warm blanket of super-voting shares, ensuring lifetime control. Not every VC likes this! Not every VC wants to anoint a king instead of a CEO! And yet, you will not be able to get a single VC to push back on the idea of founder-friendliness, as they all want allocation in the next hot deal. And telling founders that their walking, talking piggy banks might have an <em>opinion</em>, let alone a <em>view that they should be replaced with someone with more operational experience, </em>would not be the move.</p>
<p>But Dorsey is just saying that there are times when founders are not the best folks to lead companies. This is true. While there are great examples of capital creation thanks to long founder tenures, there are perhaps even better examples of the opposite.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/"><strong>Jack logs off:</strong></a> From Twitter’s CEO role, that is. This morning, double-CEO Jack Dorsey announced that he will bounce from his perch atop Twitter, handing off the chief executive reins to the company’s CTO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorsey-twitter-and-we-have-thoughts/">TechCrunch’s take</a> is that the elevation of Parag Agrawal to the top role bodes well for the company’s larger crypto efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/"><strong>Clearview AI irks U.K.:</strong></a> While we may disagree with the United Kingdom on what to call the trunk of a car or its hood, we can agree with the island nation that Clearview AI is not our favorite company. The facial recognition shop has been given a “provisional notice” that it is to “stop further processing of U.K. citizens’ data and to delete any data it already holds.” It’s also set to receive a fine.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/black-friday-data-adds-to-evidence-e-commerce-growth-is-slowing/"><strong>Is e-commerce growth slowing?</strong></a><strong> </strong>New data from the fake U.S. shopping holiday “Black Friday” showed lower digital spending than in 2020. TechCrunch added to that data point by trawling a series of recent disappointing earnings from e-commerce companies to wonder if the online market for selling stuff is seeing its growth slow.</li>

That’s what startup Alms is cooking up. It’s something akin to the anti-Twitter, we reckon.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/algerias-yassir-picks-up-30m-to-build-a-super-app-in-north-africa/"><strong>Yassir wants to build the North African super app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Flush with a $30 million Series A, Yassir’s service that provides things like ride-hailing and delivery is building a huge marketplace for its region. The “super app for geographic region X” is a fun model to take on, as it is good in that the TAM is huge, but tough in that point-solution competitors could prove tough to beat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/foundry-lab-raises-8m-to-quickly-cheaply-create-metal-castings-using-a-microwave/"><strong>Today in great opening paragraphs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan">Rebecca Bellan</a> has a brilliant way of explaining what Foundry Lab, which just raised an $8 million round and came out of stealth earlier today, is building. So, instead of paraphrasing, here is the paragraph in its entirety:</li>

<p>Embracing a product-led growth mindset allows organizations to look at users as signals, &#8220;just like form-fill leads, de-anonymized website traffic, visitors to your booth, and the rest,&#8221; says Cunningham.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Miami City Commission voted on Monday to reinstate its e-scooter pilot program, which it had briefly banned due to safety concerns. Shared e-scooters from companies like Lime, Bird, Helbiz and Spin will return to Miami&#8217;s streets on January 15 following strict new safety measures.</p>
<p>The new program will see rules for operators and riders, according to <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/11/29/miami-city-commission-motorized-scooter-pilot-program/">CBS Miami: </a>Riders must wear a helmet and observe a maximum speed limit of 10 miles per hour on sidewalks; side-by-side riding is prohibited; only two operators are to be permitted per block, down from four; and riders must be at least 18.</p>
<p>Spin and Lime told TechCrunch they are working on solutions to be in compliance with Miami regulations and address the city&#8217;s concerns before bringing their services back next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240455" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On November 18, Miami City commissioners had voted 4 to 5 to end the e-scooter pilot that had been in place since 2018, citing risks posed by scooters on sidewalks and untrained riders on busy streets. (In last weekend&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-station/">The Station newsletter</a>, we noted the slight hypocrisy of removing the humble scooter from the streets when there are far more unsafe and environmentally unfriendly vehicles about.)</p>
<p>By midnight of November 19, micromobility operators had to disable their vehicles and collect them by 5 p.m. before the city impounded them.</p>
<p>Advocates for the e-scooter pilot have argued that not only has the program brought in $2.4 million in revenue that was used to create bike lanes, but also that their services help residents with first- and last-mile travel and generally reduce car usage and emissions.</p>
<p>The commission voted 3 to 1 on Monday to rescind the ban.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="sc-bdVaJa dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 cynzxG">“Change is coming; it’s going to happen anyway. Regulate it,” Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla said, according to <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/11/29/diaz-de-la-portilla-tries-to-persuade-other-commissioners-to-allow-electric-scooters-in-miami/">WPLG Local 10</a>, adding police officers can enforce rules such as speed limits.</p>
<div>&#8220;This news comes as a relief to Miami residents who&#8217;ve long relied on e-scooters as a safe, affordable and sustainable way to get around,&#8221; Bruno Lopes, senior manager for government relations at Lime, said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to working closely with the commissioners and Mayor [Francis] Suarez to develop a permanent program that prioritizes safety for riders and non-riders alike. We specifically hope the city will continue to invest the millions of dollars in e-scooter fees Lime and other operators pay into protected bike lanes, the most proven way to ensure the safety of all road users.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a> was introduced way back in 2009 to help AWS customers view data about their cloud usage and spending. Today at the dawn of <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent</a>, the company&#8217;s cloud customer conference taking place in Las Vegas this week, the cloud division announced a couple of enhancements to the product.</p>
<p>Amazon has been building on the types of data provided by CloudWatch, and today it <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-rum/">added user monitoring</a>. With Real User Monitoring, AWS customers can understand when there is a problem with a deployment and take corrective action before customers really begin to feel it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon CloudWatch RUM will help you to collect the metrics that give you the insights that will help you to identify, understand, and improve this experience. You simply register your application, add a snippet of JavaScript to the header of each page and deploy,&#8221; Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Barr wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-rum/">in a blog post</a> announcing the feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t exactly fall under the category of stunning innovation. It&#8217;s something companies like AppDynamics and New Relic have been doing for years, but as with most things Amazon they are providing a soup-to-nuts experience for customers inside AWS, and this type of monitoring lets you know when things could be going wrong with your AWS application.</p>
<p>The other new feature is a new experiments tool called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/features/">CloudWatch Evidently</a>, which helps developers set feature flags and run A/B tests inside an application they are building on top of AWS. Rather than just updating an app for every user, developers may want to test it on a limited subset of users and see if the new feature breaks anything or if users prefer a particular approach or design more.</p>
<p>They can limit the people who see a new feature by setting a feature flag in the code and setting up the parameters for that feature. In addition, you can do A/B testing, another form of experimentation, that lets you test features with a certain subset of users to see which feature or design people prefer.</p>
<p>Neither of these is new either. Companies like<a href="http://split.io"> Split.io</a> have been doing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/split-io-announces-50m-series-d-to-continue-growing-feature-flag-platform/">more broad feature flag management</a> for some time, and companies like <a href="http://Optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/optimizely-x/">building companies around A/B testing</a>.</p>
<p>CloudWatch Evidently is already available in nine Amazon cloud regions with pay-as-you-go pricing, while CloudWatch RUM is also available now in 10 regions at a cost of $1 per 100,000 events collected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The director of the National Labor Relation Board’s 10th region has authorized a new union election for workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center. An NLRB representative has confirmed the decision with TechCrunch, which would see the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union getting a second chance to unionize workers at the site, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">defeat back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The victory was a lopsided one for the mega-retailer, though the RWDSU immediately called shenanigans in what was expected to be a major test for unionizing efforts for blue collar tech workers. At the time, the union accused Amazon of “gaslighting” employees through “egregious and blatantly illegal action.”</p>
<p>Amazon naturally denied the accusations, stating, “It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true. Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>RWDSU head Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement today that the new ruling serves as vindication for those earlier claims, “Today’s decision confirms what we were saying all along — that Amazon’s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace — and as the Regional Director has indicated, that is both unacceptable and illegal. Amazon workers deserve to have a voice at work, which can only come from a union.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The National Labor Relations Board will conduct a second secret ballot election among the unit employees,&#8221; the board noted in its ruling. &#8220;Employees will vote whether they wish to be represented for purposes of collective bargaining by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. The manner, date, time, and place of the election will be specified in a Notice of Second Election.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruling specifically affirmed the RWDSU&#8217;s objections to an on-site mailbox installed by Amazon, as well as &#8220;vote no&#8221; signage. The followup election will no doubt become another national flashpoint for unionization efforts that have only grown in momentum during the pandemic and subsequent economic slowdowns.</p>
<p>Amazon expressed displeasure at today&#8217;s ruling. Spokesperson Kelly Nantel noted in a statement:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It’s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count. As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle. The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated — these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few. While we’ve made great progress in important areas like pay and safety, we know there are plenty of things that we can keep doing better, both in our fulfillment centers and in our corporate offices, and that&#8217;s our focus — to work directly with our employees to keep getting better every day.</p>

<p>A date for the re-vote has not yet been confirmed &#8212; nor is it clear whether the vote will be conducted in person or via mail. Amazon can request a board review in an attempt to delay or cancel a second vote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen will go before Congress again this week, this time offering her unique perspective on the company&#8217;s moderation and policy failures as they relate to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the key legal shield that protects online platforms from liability for the user-created content they host.</p>
<p>The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology will hold the hearing, titled &#8220;<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-holding-big-tech-accountable-targeted-reforms-to-techs-legal">Holding Big Tech Accountable: Targeted Reforms to Tech&#8217;s Legal Immunity</a>,&#8221; this Wednesday, December 1 at 10:30 a.m. EST. Color of Change President Rashad Robinson and Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer will also testify on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hearing is the latest Section 230-focused discussion from the House committee. In March, the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter went before lawmakers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">defend the measures</a> they&#8217;ve taken to fight misinformation and disinformation — two major areas of concern that have inspired Democratic lawmakers to reexamine tech&#8217;s longstanding liability shield.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240280" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">October Senate hearing</a>, Haugen advocated for changes to Section 230 that would hold platforms accountable for the content that they promote algorithmically. While Haugen isn&#8217;t an expert on legislative solutions to some of social media&#8217;s current ills, given her time with Facebook&#8217;s since-dismantled civic integrity team, she&#8217;s uniquely positioned to give lawmakers insight into some of the most dangerous societal outcomes of algorithmically amplified content.</p>
<p>&#8220;User-generated content is something companies have less control over. But they have 100% control over their algorithms,&#8221; Haugen said. &#8220;Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth, virality and reactiveness over public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s former News Feed lead and current Head of Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">Adam Mosseri is also set to testify</a> before the Senate for the first time next week, addressing revelations in leaked documents that the company knows its business takes a toll on the mental health of some of its youngest, most vulnerable users.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the House Energy and Commerce committee cited four tech reform bills that Congress is currently mulling: the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-leaders-announce-legislation-to-reform-section-230">Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act of 2021</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">the SAFE TECH Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3184/text">Civil Rights Modernization Act of 2021</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a>. The first bill, proposed by the committee holding Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, would lift Section 230&#8217;s liability protections in cases when a platform &#8220;knowingly or recklessly&#8221; recommends harmful content using algorithms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups are experimenting with what a better social app could look like. For a startup called <a href="https://alms.app/">Alms</a>, the answer is a social network that focuses on users&#8217; well-being through participation in creator-led challenges in areas like personal growth, sustainability and others with positive impacts. Instead of driving the collection &#8220;likes,&#8221; as on other social apps, Alms aims to encourage real-world engagement through its challenges and the specific steps and actions that must be taken.</p>
<p>The idea, explains Alms founder Alexander Nevedovsky, is to design an app that guides users to a happier and more meaningful life when they use it. That&#8217;s something modern social platforms can&#8217;t really promise to do.</p>
<p>Work on the project began during the early days of the pandemic in 2020, Nevedovsky says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240266" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of us were feeling depressed and sad, at home without much access to friends and family,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;I felt like the world really needed something that&#8217;s a bit more than just meditation, journaling or mood tracking &#8212; all those apps and techniques are great, but they&#8217;re not designed to improve your life on a day-to-day basis, interacting in the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the original version of Alms released last year was lacking something that would make the app &#8220;sticky.&#8221; Users would sign up because they liked the concept, but at some point would drop out and stop participating in the activities. The startup knew it needed something more to tie users to their journeys, which is why it has now shifted to become more of a social community.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240332" style="width: 6610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240332" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240332 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png" alt="" width="6600" height="3390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png 6600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=2048,1052 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6600px) 100vw, 6600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alms</p></div></p>
<p>When you first launch the newly designed Alms app, you&#8217;re taken through a brief onboarding process where you select your interests from three main topical areas: personal growth, sustainability and impact. For example, &#8220;personal growth&#8221; interests may include things like mental health, wellness, spirituality or relationships. &#8220;Sustainability&#8221; focuses on interests related to the environment and nature. And &#8220;impact&#8221; would wrap in things like activism, volunteering, local community and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After setup is complete, you can follow creators who post challenges or choose to join individual challenges, each with their own set of steps that have to be taken in order to fully complete them. For instance, in a challenge focused on improving your work-from-home lifestyle, the steps guide users to take steps to improve their workspace and their work-life balance (by scheduling breaks and hard stops to their day, for example) and asks them to add physical activity to their routines, among other concrete actions.</p>
<p>As you participate in a challenge by completing and checking off each step, you&#8217;re prompted to post a story about that step in that challenge&#8217;s feed to inspire others, who may add an encouraging comment. But gathering likes and comments is not Alms&#8217; goal, says Nevedovsky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see tremendous possibility in allowing more and more people with expertise in these topics &#8212; personal growth, sustainability and impact of various sorts &#8212; to basically try to scale their impact with us,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We allow them to put all their knowledge or their content in a scalable way so that people can actually &#8212; not like it, not comment under it &#8212; but actually try to repeat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At launch, Alms has <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/a08be4e225d47148ef594051b9fd6a4053369e1e?url=https%3A%2F%2Falms.app%2Fcreators&amp;userId=7520610&amp;signature=696a0e4f72d8b42c">around 30 creators</a> sharing their content in the form of challenges on its app, and 15 more are in the pipeline. It hopes to reach a couple of hundred over the next few months. So far, the new version of the app has attracted a couple of thousand users, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240334" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240334" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2240334" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-feed-GIF.gif?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240334" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alms</p></div></p>
<p>Many of the challenges on the app have been joined by hundreds of users, so you do feel some sense of participating in a larger event when you click to join. However, I&#8217;d personally prefer that posting a story and sharing it to the feed was optional &#8212; not every step deserves its own post, I feel. (And sometimes, you may not have anything to say about the minor steps you completed and end up feeling like you&#8217;ve cluttered the feed with less than helpful posts.)</p>
<p>Alms was co-founded with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/health-and-wellness-apps-maker-palta-raises-100m-series-b-led-by-vnv-global/">startup studio Palta</a>, a <a href="https://palta.com/">home</a> to apps like Flo.Health, Simple Fasting and Zing Fitness Coach. Palta owns a majority stake in Alms, and the company has no other outside investment. A remotely distributed team of fourteen works on the Alms app, which isn&#8217;t currently monetized.</p>
<p>Nevedovsky says the team is considering adding some sort of token-based economy or perhaps a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">DAO</a> that would convey some sort of real-world rewards. This could include being able to participate in Alms&#8217; governance or joining a creator fund, for example. The tokens, at least in the near term, would not be tradeable. The company may also consider simpler ideas, like in-app tipping. But nothing has yet been determined as Alms is still working on product-market fit at this time and scaling its user base.</p>
<p>Overall, Alms seems like it could appeal to those who want to be more mindful and impactful about how they&#8217;re spending their time on social apps but who are in search of inspiration that comes with more specific direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, a lot of the time, people place hopes on what will happen in the future without actually influencing it. So I think that having an app that helps you with ideas and inspiration from people who know what they share, what they recommend, is super helpful &#8212; especially when it&#8217;s all about support,&#8221; notes Nevedovsky. &#8220;People [on Alms] actually care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app, we found, is well built and attractively designed. But it could still face the original issue of having users drop off, despite its new social components, given the competition for screen time on today&#8217;s mobile devices.</p>
<p>Alms is a free download on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1526191805">iOS</a> only for the time being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir, an Algerian startup that provides on-demand services such as ride-hailing and last-mile delivery, has raised a $30 million Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment came from a long list of VCs and angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCs include WndrCo, DN Capital, Kismet Capital, Spike Ventures, Quiet Capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst, FJ Labs, VentureSouq, Nellore Capital and Moving Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The angel investors include Cleo Sham of Uber; Thomas Layton of Upwork, Opentable and Metaweb; Rohan Monga of Gojek; and Hannes Graah of Spotify and Revolut</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said in a statement that most of the investors from its $13.25 million seed round, which was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> undisclosed, participated as well.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning a Ph.D. at Stanford and spending most of his professional life in Silicon Valley working at various companies, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noureddine-tayebi/">Noureddine Tayebi</a> returned to Algeria to get involved in the country’s nascent tech scene to start a company and build technical talent in the Maghreb region (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people in French-speaking Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to a lack of trust in incumbents and inefficient banking solutions. Tayebi felt that providing on-demand services &#8212; which solves essential needs and, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> builds trust to then provide payment services &#8212; was the catalyst to enable financial inclusion in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He founded Yassir with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-yettou-3075b0137/">Mahdi Yettou</a> in 2017. The company started with ride-hailing services because the cities it targeted had dense populations and inefficient transportation services. Yassir progressed to offer last-mile delivery services, creating a multi-sided marketplace that brings drivers, couriers, merchants, suppliers and wholesalers to individual users on one platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tayebi, the plan is to use the marketplace model to offer payment services to all parties involved and create a super app in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach of solving the unbanked population problem is unique in the region by offering more of a &#8216;banking as a platform&#8217; solution where daily services are at the heart of it all via a super-app marketplace,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such services not only build trust for all the sides of the marketplace but also use them as channels to offer these payment services, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the approach that is most suited to the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of our competitors are either on-demand services &#8212; ride-hailing or last-mile delivery only &#8212; or pure payment solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gives us an edge over them as we build the network, the channels and the trust that are all key ingredients for the adoption of payment services at large scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir has seen exponential growth since launching four years ago. Last year, it was part of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/yassir">Y Combinator’s winter batch</a> as the first Algerian startup in the accelerator. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traction, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 3 million people and 40,000 partners in all its markets now use the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tayebi said that Yassir generates revenues by taking a commission on the services it offers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round of funding makes Yassir the most funded startup in Algeria and one of the most funded in the Maghreb and MENA region. Tayebi isn’t coy about saying his company aims for regional dominance in its category. Yassir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also plans to gain market share outside the region into other markets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sub-Saharan Africa and other &#8220;strategic geographies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve that as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth in its existing markets by launching new products and improving existing ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir also plans to triple the size of its engineering team, a department the company is also particular about building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are [a] 100% local champion, including tech talent, as we want to empower the tech talent in the region and hire them in each country we operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want a success model that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the region,&#8221; Tayebi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yassir is a natural evolution of companies seen elsewhere in the world,&#8221; WndrCo partner Anthony Saleh said in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment we met the team, we saw the opportunity of entering an enormous market with a service taking the best of models we have seen elsewhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re thrilled to be part of this supercharged journey.”</span></p>

<p>Well, so much for a relaxed post-holiday week on Monday.</p>
<p>News broke this morning that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepping down from the company entirely</a>. The company&#8217;s CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga">Parag Agrawal</a>, will be taking over at the helm. Saleforce exec Bret Taylor will take over as board chairman.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> jumped into onto the mics &#8212; and, ironically, a <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">Twitter space</a> &#8212; to riff on all things Jack and future of Twitter. From the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto and the CTO, what can we read from the tea leaves?</li>
<li>Jack&#8217;s dual role, and its detractors.</li>
<li>The fact that Twitter&#8217;s product work has been <em>great</em> lately, which we don&#8217;t want to stop. When is a good time to leave a company, is it on the up and up or when things are quiet?</li>
<li>And, finally, Jack&#8217;s somewhat biting words regarding founder-led companies, which are, frankly, a bit at odds with his own behavior until now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show is back on Wednesday, unless some other major CEO resigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-get-started-with-quantum-computing/">launched</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/">Braket</a>, its quantum computing service that makes hardware and software tools from its partners Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave available in its cloud. Given how quickly quantum computing is moving ahead, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that a lot has changed since then. Among other things, hybrid algorithms that use classical computers to optimize quantum algorithms &#8212; a process similar to training machine learning models &#8212; have become a standard tool for developers. Today, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-braket-hybrid-jobs-set-up-monitor-and-efficiently-run-hybrid-quantum-classical-workloads/">announced</a> improved support for running these hybrid algorithms on Braket.</p>
<p>Previously, to run these algorithms, developers would have to set up and manage the infrastructure to run the optimization algorithms on classical machines and then manage the integration with the quantum computing hardware, in addition to the monitoring and visualization tools for analyzing the results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=768,329 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240292" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. &#8220;Another big challenge is that [Quantum Processing Units] are shared, inelastic resources, and you compete with others for access,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Danilo Poccia explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;This can slow down the execution of your algorithm. A single large workload from another customer can bring the algorithm to a halt, potentially extending your total runtime for hours. This is not only inconvenient but also impacts the quality of the results because today’s QPUs need periodic re-calibration, which can invalidate the progress of a hybrid algorithm. In the worst case, the algorithm fails, wasting budget and time.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs feature, developers get a fully managed service that handles the hardware and software interactions between the classical and quantum machines &#8212; and developers will get priority access to quantum processing units to provide them with more predictability. Braket will automatically spin up the necessary resources (and shut them down once a job is completed). Developers can set custom metrics for their algorithms and, using Amazon CloudWatch, they can visualize the results in near real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As application developers, Braket Hybrid Jobs gives us the opportunity to explore the potential of hybrid variational algorithms with our customers,&#8221; said Vic Putz, head of engineering at QCWare. &#8220;We are excited to extend our integration with Amazon Braket and the ability to run our own proprietary algorithms libraries in custom containers means we can innovate quickly in a secure environment. The operational maturity of Amazon Braket and the convenience of priority access to different types of quantum hardware means we can build this new capability into our stack with confidence.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space economy is booming and for the first time ever, there&#8217;s a fair amount of exit event activity. That should have later stage investors who focus on the area excited, and we&#8217;ll be able to ask them about it directly at our virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space event</a> on December 14-15.</p>
<p>Joining us for a panel focused on later stage investing in space tech, we&#8217;ll have Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Ventures, Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Lisa Rich of Xplore all on our stage at the event. We&#8217;ll look at the significant changes in the growth investment industry when it comes to space startups that have taken place this past year, and what it means to have a lot more companies actually shipping product and growing their customer base rather than being focused more on the research and development of groundbreaking tech.</p>
<p>Hatch, who herself has experience at both Boeing and SpaceX in addition to her investment experience, also stays close to the pulse of the industry (in addition to her investment work) by co-teaching a Stanford course on helping researchers commercialize their academic work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Maguire&#8217;s focus as partner at Sequoia is on frontier tech, as well as fintech and enterprise (there&#8217;s a lot more crossover than you might expect!). His track record includes leading Sequoia&#8217;s investment in SpaceX, and he also led GV&#8217;s investment in Spinlaunch when he was a partner there prior to joining Sequoia in 2019.</p>
<p>Rich is herself an entrepreneur and founder, and has an extensive history of investing in both early stage and growth stage space companies, including Axiom Space, Made in Space, PlanetIQ and more. Rich&#8217;s own company, Xplore, also offers &#8216;space-as-a-service&#8217; to customers, providing everything needed to host and operate a payload.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Celebrate Cyber Monday and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">buy your 2-for-1 pass</a> <strong>before November 29 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>

		Currently senior principal at <a href="https://6sense.com/">6sense</a>, Kerry Cunningham is a thought leader in B2B marketing and is a former SiriusDecisions and Forrester analyst.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A few years back, my former colleagues and I at SiriusDecisions introduced what we called the Intent Data Framework (IDF). About a year ago, we updated the model to include non-behavioral signals and called it the Buyer Signals Framework (BSF).</p>
<p>Already, it’s clear we left something out of the IDF and even BSF: product-led growth.</p>
<h2>Signal substitution syndrome</h2>
<p>Both versions of the framework were attempts to address a misunderstanding that was, and still is, so rampant in B2B that I have a name for it — signal substitution syndrome. The nature of this syndrome is simple: In B2B, both marketing and sales practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If people are using the product, the need is not prospective or theoretical, it is actual.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The history of B2B could be written in the successive failure of these signals to be what we all hoped for. Whether it was people showing up at trade show booths, people filling out bingo cards from the back of magazines, the people and bots filling out website forms, webinar registrations, syndicated content leads, third-party intent signals, review site users, etc.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding that underwrites signal substitution syndrome is that any of these signals should be considered as sufficient — or even halfway decent — signals of buyer intent unto themselves. To be sure, by happenstance, some leads have occasionally turned into business in a way that can be seen and understood.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>But if there’s one thing that my time as an analyst taught me, it’s that leads are a depressingly high failure rate (95%-99%) signal. Intent data by itself is worse. However, they are both better than whatever we had before. In fact, none of these signals are, by themselves, actually expressions of intent. Expressions of interest? Sure. Intent, not so fast.</p>
<h2>How product-led growth fits in</h2>
<p>Along comes product-led growth (PLG) with the idea that we’ll offer a free or very low-cost version of our solutions and use adoption of them as the new signals that will lead to enterprise deal generation. Of course, not every product is amenable to a PLG motion. It’s pretty hard to imagine Oracle PLG-ing their manufacturing cloud, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI is facing a potential fine in the UK.</p>
<p>It has also been handed a provisional notice to stop further processing of UK citizens&#8217; data and to delete any data it already holds as a result of what the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) described as &#8220;alleged serious breaches&#8221; of national data protection law.</p>
<p>The ICO has been looking into the tech company &#8212; which sells AI-powered identity matching to law enforcement and other paying customers via a facial recognition platform that it trained covertly on photos harvested from Internet sources (like social media platforms) &#8212; in a joint investigation with the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The OAIC already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">earlier this month</a>, issued an order to Clearview to delete data after finding it broke national laws down under. So the ICO has been the laggard of the two regulators.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/ico-issues-provisional-view-to-fine-clearview-ai-inc-over-17-million/">today</a> it issued the notification of a provisional intention to fine Clearview over £17 million (~$22.6M) &#8212; citing a range of suspected breaches.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/embed/#?secret=CgfrQ06TgA" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the raft of violations the ICO suspects &#8212; following what it describes as &#8220;preliminary enquiries with Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; are failures to process people&#8217;s information fairly or in a way they expect, in line with requirements to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data and to provide adequate information to those whose data is processed; along with a failure to have a process in place to prevent data being retained indefinitely; a failure to meet higher standards required for processing biometric data &#8212; which is considered special category data under the European standard (the GDPR) that&#8217;s transposed into UK law; and also for applying problematic processes when people object to its processing of their information &#8212; such as asking for more personal data (&#8220;including photographs&#8221;) in response to such objections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the ICO&#8217;s provisional findings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson sent this statement (below), attributed to its London based attorney, Kelly Hagedorn (a partner at <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Jenner &amp; Block London LLP</span>) &#8212; who describes the ICO&#8217;s provisional finding as &#8220;factually and legally incorrect&#8221;; says Clearview is considering an appeal and &#8220;further action&#8221;; and claims the company does not do business in the UK (nor have any UK customers currently).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Clearview&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;The UK ICO Commissioner&#8217;s assertions are factually and legally incorrect. The company is considering an appeal and further action. Clearview AI provides publicly available information from the internet to law enforcement agencies. To be clear, Clearview AI does not do business in the UK, and does not have any UK customers at this time.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">Whether the ICO&#8217;s preliminary sanction will go the distance and turn into an actual fine and data processing cessation order against Clearview remains to be seen.</div>
<p>For one thing, the ICO&#8217;s notification is timed a few weeks ahead of the departure of sitting commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is set to be replaced by New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a> in January.</p>
<p>So a new broom will be in charge of deciding whether the provisional findings hold up in the face of Clearview&#8217;s objections (and potential legal action).</p>
<p>In its statement today, the ICO is careful to note that Clearview will have the opportunity to make representations &#8212; which it says it will consider before any final decision is reached, and which it furthermore suggests may not happen until mid-2022.</p>
<p>Under Denham, it&#8217;s also notable that the ICO has substantially shrunk a number of provisional penalties it handed out in relation to other breach investigations (such as those to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/uks-ico-downgrades-british-airways-data-breach-fine-to-20m-after-originally-setting-it-at-184m/">British Airways</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/uk-watchdog-reduces-marriott-data-breach-fine-to-23-8m-down-from-123m/">Marriott</a>).</p>
<p>The ICO also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/facebook-agrees-to-pay-uk-data-watchdogs-cambridge-analytica-fine-but-settles-without-admitting-liability/">settled with Facebook</a> over the Cambridge Analytica scandal after the tech giant appealed its provisional sanction.</p>
<p>And while Facebook agreed to pay the ICO&#8217;s £500k fine in full in that case it did so without admitting any liability and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog/">got the ICO to agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement over the arrangement</a> (which has limited what the commissioner can say in public about its correspondence with Facebook). So, in all, that ended up looking like a sweet deal for Facebook &#8212; agreed to by a regulator apparently concerned at being challenged in the courts over its decision-making processes.</p>
<p>There is fresh complexity on the horizon around enforcement of the UK&#8217;s data protection regime too, now &#8212; in that the government is in the process of consulting on making changes to national law that could see ministers reduce protections wrapping people&#8217;s data &#8212; such as by removing or altering requirements around transparency, fairness and what constitutes a valid legal basis for processing people&#8217;s data &#8212; as part of a claimed &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">simplification</a>&#8216; of the current laws.</p>
<p>So the ICO&#8217;s caveat on its provisional &#8220;view to fine&#8221; Clearview &#8212; which it specifies may be &#8220;subject to change or no further formal action&#8221; &#8212; looks like more than just a reminder to recall its own recent history of enforcements not standing up to its earlier convictions.</p>
<p>Why is it acting at all now if there&#8217;s a risk of ministers moving the goalposts? Denham may have an eye on amplifying her legacy as she departs for pastures new. Or she may hope to try and bind the hands of her successor &#8212; and limit the reformist zeal of DCMS to downgrade UK data protection &#8212; or, indeed, a little of all of the above.</p>
<p>In a statement, the outgoing commissioner said: “I have significant concerns that personal data was processed in a way that nobody in the UK will have expected. It is therefore only right that the ICO alerts people to the scale of this potential breach and the proposed action we’re taking. UK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime but to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products technology providers must ensure people’s legal protections are respected and complied with.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK. However, the evidence we’ve gathered and analysed suggests Clearview AI Inc were and may be continuing to process significant volumes of UK people’s information without their knowledge. We therefore want to assure the UK public that we are considering these alleged breaches and taking them very seriously,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>On the investigation findings itself, the regulator&#8217;s press release on its provisional view and potential fine offers only tentative conclusions, with the ICO writing that: &#8220;The images in Clearview AI Inc’s database are likely to include the data of a substantial number of people from the UK and may have been gathered without people’s knowledge from publicly available information online, including social media platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that it &#8220;understands that the service provided by Clearview AI Inc was used on a free trial basis by a number of UK law enforcement agencies&#8221;, and further specifying that this trial &#8220;was discontinued and Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK&#8221; &#8212; without offering any details on when the tech was being used and when usage stopped.</p>
<p>Clearview has faced regulatory pushback elsewhere around the world too.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this year</a> Canada&#8217;s privacy watchdog concluded its own investigation of the AI firm &#8212; finding multiple breaches of national law and also ordering it to cease processing citizens&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Clearview rejected the findings &#8212; but also said it no longer offered the service to Canadian law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company has now sent an additional statement on the ICO&#8217;s provisional findings, attributed to CEO Hoan Ton-That, in which he expresses &#8220;deep&#8221; disappointment at what he claims is a misinterpretation of the technology &#8212; and goes on to imply that Clearview AI might have been useful for UK law enforcement investigations into child sexual abuse (an area where the UK government is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">currently spending taxpayer money</a> to try to encourage the development of novel detection technologies).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Ton-That&#8217;s statement [emphasis his]:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;I grew up in Australia and have long viewed the UK as an important, majestic place—one about which I have the deepest respect.  I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner  has misinterpreted my technology and intentions. I created the consequential facial recognition technology known the world over.  My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors, and other victims of unscrupulous acts. <i>It breaks my heart that </i><i>Clearview AI has been unable to assist when receiving urgent requests from UK law enforcement agencies seeking to use this technology to investigate cases of severe sexual abuse of children in the UK.</i> We collect only public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law.  I am disheartened by the misinterpretation of Clearview AI’s technology to society.  I would welcome the opportunity to engage in conversation with leaders and lawmakers so the true value of this technology which has proven so essential to law enforcement can continue to make communities safe.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To kick off <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">re:Invent</a>, AWS&#8217;s flagship conference, the cloud computing giant today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/preview-aws-iot-roborunner-for-building-robot-fleet-management-applications/">announced</a> IoT <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/roborunner/">RoboRunner</a>, a new service for building applications that help large fleets of robots work together. This new service aims to provide the infrastructure necessary to build the work and fleet management applications necessary to run the kind of robot fleets that Amazon itself utilizes in its warehouses, for example.</p>
<p>The company also today announced a new robotics accelerator program.</p>
<p>At its core, RoboRunner helps developers build applications that integrate with robots from different manufacturers and manage the lifecycle of these applications. Currently, AWS argues, it&#8217;s too difficult to integrate robots from different vendors into a single system, leaving enterprises with a number of silos where they manage their robots, which in turn makes it hard to build applications where these heterogeneous fleets cooperate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In addition to RoboRunner, AWS also <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/11/announcing-the-aws-robotics-startup-accelerator.html">announced</a> a new robotics startup accelerator, the AWS Robotics Startup Accelerator, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.massrobotics.org/project/awsroboticsaccelerator/">MassRobotics</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, there are only a few successful commercial robotics companies, and there are a few big reasons for this,&#8221; AWS CTO Werner Vogels writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;First, finding a fit in the robotics product market is difficult because real-world environments are dynamic and unpredictable, so pairing the right niche with the right capabilities can be a challenge. Second, building robots with a high degree of autonomy and intelligence requires multidisciplinary skills that are hard to find and recruit for. Third, robotics is capital intensive and requires large up-front investment in sensors, actuators, and mechanical hardware even when they’re already commercially available.&#8221;</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he new program is open to early-stage startups (less than $10 million in revenue and $100 million raised. The selected companies will get access to specialized training and mentorship from robotics experts and up to $10,000 in AWS credits.  </span></p>
