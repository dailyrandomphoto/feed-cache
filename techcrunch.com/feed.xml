										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outlets that follow the crypto industry have been <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/98358/nft-search-volume-on-google-hits-all-time-high-as-platform-user-count-nears-400k">observing</a> a <a href="https://decrypt.co/62580/interest-in-nfts-has-reached-2017-ico-levels">trend</a>, which is that according to Google search data, the rise in interest in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, now almost matches the level of interest in 2017 in initial coin offerings, or ICOs.</p>
<p>Of course, ICOs largely disappeared from the scene after the SEC started poking around and determining, in some cases, that they were being used to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/doj-indicts-john-mcafee-on-money-laundering-fraud-charges">launder money</a>. Now experts in blockchain transactions see the potential for abuse again with NFTs, despite the traceable nature of the tokens &#8212; and perhaps even because of it.</p>
<p>As most readers may know at this point (because they&#8217;re increasingly hard to avoid), an NFT is a kind of digital collectible that can come in almost any form, a PDF, a tweet &#8212; even a digitized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html">New York Times column</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each of these items &#8212; and there can be many copies of the same item &#8212; is stamped with a long string of alphanumerics that makes it immutable. As early crypto investor David Pakman of Venrock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/what-the-nft-vc-david-pakman-dumbs-down-the-digital-collectibles-frenzy-and-why-its-taking-off-now/">explains it</a>, that code is also recorded on the blockchain, so that there&#8217;s a permanent record of who own what. Someone else can screenshot that PDF or tweet or Times column, but they won&#8217;t be able to do anything with that screenshot, whereas the NFT owner can, theoretically at least, sell that collectible at some point to a higher bidder.</p>
<p>The biggest NFT sale to date, about 15 days ago, was the sale of digital artist Mike Winkelmann&#8217;s &#8220;Everydays: The First 5000 Days,&#8221; which sold for a stunning $69 million &#8212; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html">third-highest auction price</a> achieved for a living artist, after Jeff Koons and David Hockney. Winkelmann, who uses the name Beeple, broke his own record with the sale, having sold another crypto art piece for <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001">$6.6 million</a> in February. (Earlier this week, he sold yet another for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beeple-sells-latest-nft-runner-up-bidder-record-crypto-art-2021-3">$6 million</a>.) There is such a frenzy that Beeple has told numerous outlets that he believes there&#8217;s a crypto art &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-21/prices-in-a-bubble-beeple-says-after-his-69-million-nft-sale">bubble</a>&#8221; and that many NFTs will &#8220;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/beeple-some-nft-investments-will-hit-zero-crypto-art-bubble-2021-3">absolutely go to zero</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is so much money involved that experts believe that NFTs have become a rife opportunity for bad actors, even if action hasn&#8217;t been brought against one yet.</p>
<p>One of the most practical dangers centers on trade-based money laundering, or the process of disguising illegal proceeds by moving them through trade transactions in an effort to legitimize them. It&#8217;s already a huge issue in the art world, and NFTs are comparable to art, with even more erratic pricing right now.</p>
<p>Jesse Spiro, the chief of government affairs at the blockchain analysis firm <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">Chainalysis</a> explains it this way: &#8220;One of the ways to identify trade-based money laundering with [traditional] art is that [an appraiser] comes up with a fair market value for something, and you&#8217;re able to measure that fair market value against the pricing that&#8217;s involved [and flag] over invoicing or under invoicing, which is either selling that asset for less than it&#8217;s worth, or for more than it&#8217;s worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news is that in some instances where hundreds or even thousands of NFTs are being sold, even at very different prices, as has been happening with <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/packs">NBA highlight clips</a>, there&#8217;s an average value that can be measured, Spiro notes, and that makes unusual activity easier to spot.</p>
<p>In cases where it&#8217;s impossible to establish a sales history, however, its ultimate price &#8220;could be whatever the buyer is willing to pay for something, so you can&#8217;t really make that determination&#8221; that something nefarious is afoot. According to Spiro, &#8220;All that&#8217;s needed is two parties that are involved to effectively execute that [transaction] successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many other flavors of crime when it comes to digital assets and, potentially, with regard to NFTs. Asaf Meir, the cofounder and CEO of the crypto market surveillance company <a href="https://www.soliduslabs.com/">Solidus Labs</a>, points as examples to wash trades, where an individual or outfit simultaneously sells and buys the same financial instruments; as well as cross trades, which involve a trade between two accounts within the same organization, all to create a false record around the price of an asset that doesn&#8217;t reflect the true market price.</p>
<p>Both are illegal under money laundering laws and also very hard to spot, especially for legacy systems. The &#8220;tricky thing about the crypto markets is they are retail-oriented first, so there could be multiple different accounts with multiple addresses doing multiple things in collusion &#8212; sometimes mixed or not mixed with institutional accounts for different beneficial owners,&#8221; says Meir, who met his cofounders at Goldman Sachs, where they worked on the electronic trading desk for equities and quickly observed that surveillance for digital assets was very much an unsolved issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that not everyone thinks it likely that NFTs are being used to transfer money illegally. Says Pakman, an investor in the NFT marketplace<a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/"> Dapper Labs</a>, &#8220;Crytpo purists are upset this happened, but national governments can go to marketplaces and exchanges and they can say, &#8216;In order for you to do business, you need to follow [know-your-customer] and [anti-money-laundering] laws that force [these entities] to get a verified identify of everyone of their customers. Then any suspicious transactions over a certain amount, they have to file paperwork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two tools make it easier for authorities to subpoena the marketplaces and exchanges when a suspicious transaction is flagged and force the outfits to verify their user&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>Still, one question is how effective such a process is if enough time elapses between the suspicious transaction and it being flagged. Pakman answers that &#8220;everything is retroactively researchable. If you get away with it today, there&#8217;s nothing to stop the FBI from tracking it a year later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another question is why money launderers would bother with NFTs when there are easier ways to transfer large sums of money in the crypto world. Max Galka, cofounder and CEO of the blockchain analytics platform <a href="https://elementus.io/">Elementus</a>, says that &#8220;one piece that kind of makes me think NFTs might not be the best vehicle for money laundering is just that secondary markets are not as liquid,&#8221; meaning it isn&#8217;t so easy for bad actors to create distance between themselves and a transaction.</p>
<p>Galka also wonders whether a criminal wouldn&#8217;t instead simply go to a decentralized exchange and buy up liquid tokens that are truly fungible (meaning no unique information can be written into the token) so that the location of those funds is harder to trace than with a nonfungible token.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly see the potential for money laundering here, but given that there are lots of assets out there on the blockchain that people can use for that, [NFTs] may not be best-suited&#8221; compared with their other options, says Galka.</p>
<p>Theoretically, Spiro of Chainalysis agrees on all fronts, but he suggests that the minting and sale of NFTs have ballooned so fast that a lot of processes that should be in place are not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most NFTs operate on the Ethereum blockchain, so it&#8217;s technically true that these are traceable,&#8221; he says. It&#8217;s also true that &#8220;the entities running these NFTs should have compliance and work with blockchain forensics and analytics to ensure that someone is able to follow the flow of funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, in an &#8220;ideal world, you&#8217;d be able to follow transactions, and then at the choke points where individuals were trying to convert whatever token they&#8217;re using into maybe fiat currency, they&#8217;d have to provide their [personal identifiable information]&#8221; and law enforcement or regulators could then see if the transaction was connected to illicit activity.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nifty-gateway-nft-hack-lessons">not there yet</a>, though, which means bad things could very definitely be happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now,&#8221; says Spiro, &#8220;compliance in relation to these NFTs is a gray area.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hong Kong-based <a href="https://www.viact.ai/">viAct</a> helps construction sites perform around-the-clock monitoring with an AI-based cloud platform that combines computer vision, edge devices and a mobile app. The startup announced today it has raised a $2 million seed round, co-led by SOSV and Vectr Ventures. The funding included participation from Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, Artesian Ventures and ParticleX.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, viAct currently serves more than 30 construction industry clients in Asia and Europe. Its new funding will be used on research and development, product development and expanding into Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>The platform uses computer vision to detect potential safety hazards, construction progress and the location of machinery and materials. Real-time alerts are sent to a mobile app with a simple interface, designed for engineers who are often &#8220;working in a noisy and dynamic environment that makes it hard to look at detailed dashboards,&#8221; co-founder and chief operating officer Hugo Cheuk told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As companies signed up for viAct to monitor sites while complying with COVID-19 social distancing measures, the company provided training over Zoom to help teams onboard more quickly.</p>
<p>Cheuk said the company’s initial markets in Southeast Asia will include Indonesia and Vietnam because government planning for smart cities and new infrastructure means new construction projects there will increase over the next five to 10 years. It will also enter Singapore because developers are willing to adopt AI-based technology.</p>
<p>In a press statement, SOSV partner and Chinaccelerator managing director Oscar Ramos said, &#8220;COVID has accelerated digital transformation and traditional industries like construction are going through an even faster process of transformation that is critical for survival. The viAct team has not only created a product that drives value for the industry but has also been able to earn the trust of their customers and accelerate adoption.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the governments of the United States and China are pushing policies for technological decoupling, private tech firms continue to tap resources from both sides. In the field of autonomous vehicles, it&#8217;s common to see Chinese startups &#8212; or startups with a strong Chinese link &#8212; keep operations and seek investments in both countries.</p>
<p>But as these companies mature and expand globally, their ties to China also come under increasing scrutiny.</p>
<p>When TuSimple, a self-driving truck company headquartered in San Diego, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-files-to-go-public/">filed for an initial public offering</a> on Nasdaq this week, its prospectus flagged a regulatory risk due to its Chinese funding source.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On March 1, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) requested a written notice from TuSimple regarding an investment by Sun Dream, an affiliate of Sina Corporation, which runs China&#8217;s biggest microblogging platform Sina Weibo. Sun Dream is TuSimple&#8217;s largest shareholder with 20% Class A shares. Charles Chao and Bonnie Yi Zhang, respectively the CEO and CFO of Weibo, are both members of TuSimple&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>If the U.S. government concludes that Sun Dream&#8217;s investment poses a threat to the national security of the country, the investor may be told to divest from TuSimple, the filing notes.</p>
<p>Several China-based autonomous driving upstarts, including WeRide.ai, Pony.ai and AutoX, keep research labs in California and have secured regulatory permits to test in the U.S., but most don&#8217;t seem to have apparent commercial plans in the country.</p>
<p>TuSimple, on the other hand, is focused on the U.S. for now, with 50 of its Level 4 semi-trucks hauling in the U.S. and 20 operating in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their strong Chinese background could hobble their U.S.-focused strategy,&#8221; an executive from a Chinese autonomous vehicle startup told TechCrunch, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>TuSimple cannot comment because it&#8217;s in the pre-IPO quiet period.</p>
<p>This kind of roadblock is hardly new to China-related tech firms coveting the U.S. market (or its allies). In a more famous instance, CFIUS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">opened a national security probe</a> into ByteDance&#8217;s $1 billion acquisition of Musical.ly, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/musically-tiktok/">folded into TikTok</a>. As of last December, the agency was &#8220;engaging with ByteDance&#8221; to complete a divestment, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-exclusive/u-s-not-extending-tiktok-divestiture-deadline-but-talks-will-continue-sources-idUSKBN28F00V">reported</a>.</p>
<p>While self-driving ventures can divest to shed their Chinese association, it may be more complicated to achieve short-term supply chain independence in an industry with tight global ties, as an executive from Momenta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">pointed out</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://uilicious.com/">UI-licious</a>, a Singapore-based startup that simplifies automated user interface testing for web applications, announced today it has raised $1.5 million in pre-Series A funding. The round was led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures and will be used to grow UI-licious’ product development and marketing teams.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Shi Ling Tai and Eugene Cheah, UI-licious serves companies of all sizes, and its current clients include Daimler, Jones Lang LaSalle and tech recruitment platform Glints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tai, UI-licious’ chief executive officer, said that about 90% of software teams around the world rely on manual testing, which is both time-consuming and expensive. UI-licious enables users to write test scripts in pseudocode, or a language that is similar to plain English and therefore accessible to people with little programming experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130058" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130058" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130058" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png" alt="A screenshot of UI-licious' test reporting feature" width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png 1768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Show-not-tell.-Enriched-test-reporting.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2130058" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of UI-licious&#8217; test reporting feature</p></div></p>
<p>Software teams can then schedule how often the tests run. UI-licious’ proprietary smart targeting test engine supports all browsers and allows the same scripts to be run even if there are changes in a web application’s user interface or underlying code. It also produces detailed error reports to reduce the time needed to find and fix a bug.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As low-code startups continue to attract VC interest, what&#8217;s driving customer demand?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand/embed/#?secret=u04aJ7hE18" data-secret="u04aJ7hE18" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When asked how UI-licious compares to other automated user interface testing solutions, Tai told TechCrunch, &#8220;Coded solutions require a trained engineer to inspect the website’s code to write the test scripts. The problem is that most software testers are not trained programmers, sometimes they may be the marketing or sales team that owns the project. And while there are other no-code solutions that allow non-programmers to record their actions and replay it, such tests tend to become obsolete quickly as the UI changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>UI-licious’ selling point is that &#8220;it is designed to make it accessible for anyone to automate UI testing and set up error alerts without needing to know how to code,&#8221; she added. &#8220;UI-licious also reduces the effort to maintain the tests as the UI code changes with its smart targeting test engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>In press statement, Monk’s Hill Ventures partner Justin Nguyen said, &#8220;Co-founders Shi Ling and Eugene have developed a product to address the quality assurance issues that have plagued the software automation industry for decades,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the team&#8217;s experience as software engineers has equipped them with the technical knowledge and insights to build a simple and robust tool that empowers manual testers to automate testing and detect bugs before users do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWrgTaYD4p0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The other day, I attended a celebration of one of the pioneers of collaboration technology, Ray Ozzie. The father of Lotus Notes, Ozzie left Lotus and his startup firm Iris after a hostile takeover by IBM, and eventually joined Microsoft when that company acquired his next startup, Groove. By &#8220;attended&#8221; I mean a virtual event put on by the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. Ray&#8217;s peers and partners gathered in a Zoom chat, with a tour of Ray&#8217;s early days including amazing hardware like a touchscreen based enterprise chat system called Plato, and these strange things called floppy disks with the earliest source code for DOS and other prehistoric things called operating systems.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, Ray soon became one of several CTOs, and eventually took the role of Chief Software Architect as he helped midwife the company&#8217;s move toward the Web and away from its dominant Office suite. Politically, he faced the twin power centers in Redmond: Office and Windows, the latter of which has receded in strategic importance as mobile technologies like iOS and Android took over in the wake of Apple&#8217;s iPhone success. But there&#8217;s no doubt that Ray&#8217;s elevation allowed Bill Gates, who spoke movingly about Ray at the CHM, to pivot to focus with his wife on the philanthropy role at their Foundation. Talk about just in time, as Bill&#8217;s voice in the battle against the pandemic has often been a trusted beacon of hope and science in a sea of denial, misinformation, and well, you know the rest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In his gracious speech, Ray mentioned Gates, Lotus founder Mitch Kapor, and a name less well known to many, Dave Winer. I&#8217;m not positive why Dave was called out, but I&#8217;m sure it had something to do with Winer&#8217;s work championing the development of blogging, RSS, and its attachment extensions that birthed podcasting. In today&#8217;s climate of media streaming, newsletters, and live conversation-casting a la Clubhouse, surviving the pandemic means marshaling our tools to work and live more deeply and richly from anywhere. Talk about just in time.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is under attack in the Twitterverse, with some suggesting it&#8217;s just another outlet for the noise of social media, or a business idea destined for landfill in the wake of the next shiny object. Clubhouse counterattacked with another overflow megasession from Facebook&#8217;s Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Spotify and Shopify. The messaging app Telegram pushed a voice chat 2.0 release with tools for inviting speakers, listeners, raising your hand to speak, and recording built in. The stampede continues, but to what end? Like NFTs, a grifters&#8217; paradise?</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;re experiencing a massive multiplayer game where collaborative innovations are being combined and redefined on the fly. One Clubhouse session materialized with one of the big thinkers in mobile, Benedict Evans. After several years as an analyst at Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) , he&#8217;s moved back to London and gone paid newsletter with some of his 150,000 plus subscribers to his weekly free version. Struggling as I am with rising subscription costs, I&#8217;ve been making do with waiting for some of his firewalled essays to play off in the free version. But here was a session with Benedict and another former A16Z analyst focused on NFTs and crypto, Morgan Beller.</p>
<p>The talk was at a torrid clip, but meta across both the upside possibilities and the context of earlier innovations that seemed heavy on the gamble but paid off. This was vintage Evans in a casual setting where he gave me a ton of signal, bouncing off an analyst I immediately followed after ten minutes or so, adding her to a notification stream the next time she joined in. At one point, the moderator pinged me to invite me to join in, but thankfully I chose the &#8220;maybe later&#8221; option so I could go back to desperately trying to keep up with the flow. Maybe later when I actually know something by learning from people who live and breathe this stuff. I can&#8217;t even be sure what fungible means so far.</p>
<p>It was not your average big ticket press conference; it was access to people steeped in their interests and willing to be measured against the astuteness of their observations. The social following tools ostensibly produce more effective notifications based on providing interruptions the listener is willing to accept. The size of the crowd is manageable (50 -100) and drafts off the characteristics of not just who is on stage but who&#8217;s listening and in what combinations. It&#8217;s a mixture (I hope) of follows plus percentage of successful clicks on targeted notifications.</p>
<p>This all feels like a mashup of collaborative platforms, menu items in a new operating system where ideas and tactics are tested transparently in the open. Remember our former president, who famously laundered the unthinkable in public as a way of commanding the conversation. The alphabet soup of NFTs and SPACs is difficult to separate from MLMs and such of previous eras, but eventually we&#8217;ll figure out what&#8217;s real. A good place to start is in the trenches with practitioners of this new arts yakking it up on the new media channels.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Steady founder and CEO Adam Roseman and Flourish Ventures' Emmalyn Shaw joined Jordan Crook for a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to Steady, the platform that helps hourly workers manage their income, maximize their income, and access deals on things like benefits and financial services, the strengths of the business are clear. But it took time for founder and CEO Adam Roseman to clearly define and communicate each of them in his quest for fundraising.</p>
<p>To date, Steady has raised just under $30 million with investors that include Loeb.nyc, Recruit Strategic Partners, Propel Ventures and Flourish Ventures. In fact, Flourish&#8217;s Emmalyn Shaw sits on the board, having led the company&#8217;s Series A round in 2018.</p>
<p>As a partner at a $500 million fintech fund, her expertise in not only how fintech companies should think about fundraising but what it takes for them to be successful is invaluable. Lucky for us, we got the chance to sit down with both Steady CEO Adam Roseman and Emmalyn Shaw for a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>The duo were gracious enough to walk us through Steady&#8217;s Series A deck, explaining the importance of highlighting the strengths of the business. They went into detail on how Steady was successful in that during that fundraising process, and what the company could have done differently to be more effectively.</p>
<p>Shaw and Roseman also gave some fantastic advice for founders during the Pitch Deck Teardown, wherein speakers give their expert feedback on decks submitted by the audience. (If you&#8217;d like to have your pitch deck featured on an episode of Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.)</p>
<h2>Relationships first</h2>
<p>Roseman shared that the best investors are ones that not only understand the business but understand you as a founder and a person. He explained that he and Shaw had plenty of time to get to know each other before the Series A deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a part of businesses in the past as an entrepreneur and on boards where it&#8217;s been the worst situation, especially when they don&#8217;t understand your business,&#8221; said Roseman. &#8220;Flourish took the time to understand it through and through and was entirely aligned. That makes for the best long-term partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s a cliche, it remains true that investors often place bets based on a team and not an idea or a product. But what exactly makes a great team or founder? According to Shaw, it&#8217;s about vision and passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Adam&#8217;s case, he has a direction connection to what Steady is trying to do,&#8221; said Shaw. &#8220;That makes a huge difference in terms of commitment because you have ups and downs. They bring experience in terms of understanding the space, how to penetrate and scale and a deep understanding of fintech.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our picks for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">the most intriguing companies</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">of Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch</a> were based entirely on substance and our endless expertise, so it&#8217;s time for something much more superficial. Here are the 11 best logos from the hundreds of companies that presented yesterday.</p>
<p>Watching companies go by 60 seconds at a time for like eight hours was pretty mind-numbing, even when a lot of them were cool, but I always perked up when I saw something with a nice logo. So I started marking them down, and sure enough soon a post appeared.</p>
<p>Sadly many of these will be bought in short order and their cool logos retired, like what happened with my favorite recent logo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/encrypted-data-handling-startup-datafleets-acquired-by-liveramp-for-over-68m/">DataFleets</a>. I guess it isn&#8217;t really sad because they all get super rich, but there goes a perfectly good logo, you know?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Encrypted data handling startup DataFleets acquired by LiveRamp for over $68M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/encrypted-data-handling-startup-datafleets-acquired-by-liveramp-for-over-68m/embed/#?secret=MEL9CBaZjM" data-secret="MEL9CBaZjM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s proceed. These aren&#8217;t in any particular order except that the first three are my favorites and the rest all tie for fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Enombic</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2129945 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="238" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg 1919w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=1536,539 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/enombic.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a>A capital E always makes a lot of interesting geometric possibilities available. Enombic&#8217;s logo makes the most of this famous trisulc optical illusion while not overdoing it, giving a clear (if impossible) shape that is also obviously a letter — without any extraneous lines or materials, in fact with the absolute minimum. The clean type is also well-chosen (and avoids repetition by changing case). Gold star.</p>
<p><strong>Uiflow</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uiflow-logo.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>This isn&#8217;t the first time a U and I have been joined in this way, but it&#8217;s done here very elegantly and with complementary curves and spacing in all the right places. They use the inversion of the above as well, but I think white on black looks better than black on white.</p>

<p><strong>Perfect Recall</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/perfect-recall.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>Here&#8217;s one where the logo is informed by the purpose of the company, which records and highlights video calls. A loop with an arrow is a universal cross-lingual symbol for returning to something, and there are a few ways to do this that are flashier but don&#8217;t look as good. Getting the effect of a circle and not just a semicircle without compromising the shape of the P is a tough thing to balance. This logo does have the awkward side effect of putting a recognizable P right before the P in perfect, so you end up with PPerfect Recall. It happens a lot, but still something to watch out for.</p>
<p><strong>Furmacy</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129951" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="155" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/furmacy.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>Another logo actually informed by the company&#8217;s purpose, this one combined with the logotype could do with a little more work (the tail curve bothers me, the plus is too much, and the Dr Mario player in me wants a solid lower capsule half) — but it&#8217;s immediately recognizable and adequately communicates what the company does wordlessly, a rare quality. Got to hand it to them for the name, too.</p>
<p><strong>Routine</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="152" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg?resize=150,46 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/routine.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>It&#8217;s a bold decision to leave off half the &#8220;o&#8221; in any situation, since it can quickly become another letter or symbol if you don&#8217;t do it right. In this case using it as a rising sun works really well, also suggesting the purpose of the app. Having an uppercase R the same size as the lowercase letters is normally something that would really bother me, and might have gone badly, but it works here because of the white space left by the o. Not perfect, but surprisingly palatable.</p>
<p><strong>Dashlabs.ai</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129953" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="115" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg?resize=150,35 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg?resize=300,69 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dashlabs.jpg?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>I liked the idea of this one, but the graphic needs simplification. The proportions are off with the eyepiece, lens barrel and plate, and the dial is one element too many. I like the slotted D, but there&#8217;s something off about it. Maybe it&#8217;s an optical illusion, but some of the stripes look thicker than the others. Actually, now that I look closely it&#8217;s super obvious someone left an extra pixel on the bottom layer. The geometric type is solid too, but lose the .ai, it&#8217;s small and weird. Just&#8230; Dashlabs.</p>
<p><strong>Mendel</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="129" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg?resize=150,39 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg?resize=300,77 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mendel.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>This one truly seems to have no connection whatsoever to the company, or even the famed geneticist, but I just love the M-mountain. It would have been legendary if Mendel made hiking boots or camping gear (not too late for a pivot). This kind of letter-art is surprisingly rare to find done well, and this is really just on the charming side of primitive, but you can see the thought that went into it. The type isn&#8217;t great, though &#8212; I can&#8217;t stand those billowy d&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Nuntius Therapeutics</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129960" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="167" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nuntius.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>DNA&#8217;s double helix structure (tied in with Nuntius&#8217;s gene therapy) can be used to create lots of forms, but this capital N is really a nice one. The stylized bases aren&#8217;t exactly biologically accurate, but they work well and the sinuous curve of the helix flows beautifully into the circle.</p>
<p><strong>Aspen Cloud</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2129967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="93" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg 876w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg?resize=300,56 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg?resize=768,143 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg?resize=680,127 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aspen-cloud.jpg?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>The muted rainbow has been used to death, but apparently they just didn&#8217;t mute it enough. Aspen Cloud goes all the way into pastels, but they&#8217;re harmonious enough that they suggest CMYK rather than other polychromatic logos. The leaf-tree combo is simple and memorable, they avoid weight and symmetry problems and the colors are nicely arranged. On a white background it recedes harmlessly and on a black one it pops. Can&#8217;t say the same about the type, though. Can&#8217;t really say anything at all.</p>

<p><strong>PingPong</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2129976 size-thumbnail" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pingpong-logo.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>I hate this high-visibility color when it&#8217;s on the stupid Uber bikes that litter my neighborhood, but I have to say, it makes for a great dot. The full logotype is nothing to write home about (any logotype for a company called &#8220;ping pong&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t utilize some kind of symmetrical or two-sided motif is a waste), but what I assume is the app logo is great. The darker grey tone does a lot of work — it establishes a sort of &#8220;off-camera light&#8221; that casts a shadow, and because it&#8217;s ever so slightly narrower than the dot/ball, it gives an illusion of depth as well. I suppose it could be interpreted as being the flight line of the ball (i.e. it is zooming up and to the left) but I like my way better. It also might be a <em>little</em> too close to the flag of Japan.</p>
<p><strong>MagicBell</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2129977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/magicbell.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>I don&#8217;t know why this works, but it does. The bell combined with the chicken takes two &#8220;alarms&#8221; and makes them one cute item that screams (or rather crows) &#8220;notifications.&#8221; Or possibly &#8220;Peeps.&#8221; Let&#8217;s just hope Nintendo doesn&#8217;t sue them for infringement of a bunch of the bird-type characters in Animal Crossing (especially Knox).</p>
<hr />
<p>Good work to all these companies and the many more I only didn&#8217;t list because I got tired. Design is important, not just for catching the user&#8217;s eye, but because it indicates attention to detail and an approach beyond the purely functional — something startups often struggle with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slack launches a new direct messaging feature, Amazon Web Services gets a new leader and we round up our favorite Y Combinator startups. This is your Daily Crunch for March 24, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Don&#8217;t panic about Slack&#8217;s new Connect feature</strong></p>
<p>Slack recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/">launched the new direct messaging feature Connect</a>, which is supposed to enable employees &#8220;at more than 74,000 organizations and counting&#8221; to message anyone &#8220;inside or outside their company.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds like the exact opposite of what I&#8217;d want to see in Slack. However, we&#8217;ve confirmed that the feature is opt-in, rather than opt-out, at least on the organizational level.</p>
<p>&#8220;[A]n organization’s IT admins can control who has access to this feature, disable this feature for their teams, and monitor all external connections, including Slack Connect DMs,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;Once this feature is enabled, DMs can be initiated without the need for additional admin approval.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When AWS CEO Andy Jassy <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/aws-announces-next-ceo">announced in an email to employees</a> yesterday that Tableau CEO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">Adam Selipsky was returning to run AWS</a>, it was probably not the choice most considered. But to the industry watchers we spoke to over the last couple of days, it was a move that made absolute sense once you thought about it.</p>
<p>Gartner analyst Ed Anderson says that the cultural fit was probably too good for Jassy to pass up. Selipsky spent 11 years helping build the division. It was someone he knew well and had worked side by side with for over a decade. He could slide into the new role and be trusted to continue building the lucrative division.</p>
<p>Anderson says that even though the size and scope of AWS has changed dramatically since Selipsky left in 2016 when the company closed <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-web-services-posts-3-5b-revenue-47-last-year/">the year on a $16 billion run rate</a>, he says that the organization&#8217;s cultural dynamics haven&#8217;t changed all that much.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Success in this role requires a deep understanding of the Amazon/AWS culture in addition to a vision for AWS’s future growth. Adam already knows the AWS culture from his previous time at AWS. Yes, AWS was a smaller business when he left, but the fundamental structure and strategy was in place and the culture hasn’t notably evolved since then,&#8221; Anderson told me.</p>
<p>Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, says the experience Selipsky had after he left AWS will prove invaluable when he returns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam transformed Tableau from a desktop, licensed software company to a cloud, subscription software company that thrived. As the leader of AWS, Adam is returning to a culture he helped grow as the sales and marketing leader that brought AWS to prominence and broke through from startup customers to become the leading enterprise solution for public cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst with Constellation Research, says that Selipsky&#8217;s business experience gave him the edge over other candidates. &#8220;His business acumen won out over [internal candidates] Matt Garmin and Peter DeSantis. Insight on how Salesforce works may be helpful and valued as well,&#8221; Mueller pointed out.</p>
<p>As for leaving Tableau and with it Salesforce, the company that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/"> purchased it for $15.7 billion</a> in 2019, Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, believes that it was only a matter of time before some of these acquired company CEOs left to do other things. In fact, he&#8217;s surprised it didn&#8217;t happen sooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given Salesforce&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">growing stable of top notch CEOs</a> accumulated by way of a slew of high-profile acquisitions, you really can&#8217;t expect them all to stay forever, and given Adam Selipsky&#8217;s tenure at AWS before becoming Tableau&#8217;s CEO, this move makes a whole lot of sense. Amazon brings back one of their own, and he is also a wildly successful CEO in his own right,&#8221; Leary said.</p>
<p>While the consensus is that Selipsky is a good choice, he is going to have awfully big shoes to fill. The fact is that division is continuing to grow like a large company currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">on a run rate of over $50 billion</a>. With a track record like that to follow, and Jassy still close at hand, Selipsky has to simply continue letting the unit do its thing while putting his own unique stamp on it.</p>
<p>Any kind of change is disconcerting though, and it will be up to him to put customers and employees at ease and plow ahead into the future. Same mission. New boss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As shocking as it sounds, we could be entering a much better era for small, local businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic made remote work and on-demand delivery normal far faster than anyone expected. Today, as the world beings to emerge from the pandemic, location doesn’t matter like it did a year ago.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As shocking as it sounds, we could be entering a much better era for small, local businesses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Modern society produced superstar cities filled with skyscraper office and residential buildings. Now, the populations that once thrived in these urban centers are deciding how to repurpose them for a post-pandemic world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I caught up with ten top investors who focus on real estate property technology to get a sense of how they’re betting on the future.</p>
<p>They are optimistic overall, because the typically glacial real estate industry now sees proptech as essential to its future. However, they are the most unsure about the office sector, at least as we knew the concept before the pandemic.</p>
<p>They expect remote work to be part of the future in a significant way and foresee ongoing high housing demand in the suburbs and smaller cities. They are especially positive about fintech and SaaS products focused on areas like single-family home sales and rentals. Many are continuing to invest in big cities, but around alternative housing (co-living, accessory dwelling units) and climate-related concepts.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, some investors are actually excited about physical retail. I examined the latest evidence and found myself agreeing. As shocking as it sounds, we could be entering a much better era for small, local businesses. Details farther down.</p>
<p>(And before we dig in below, please note that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic">Extra Crunch subscribers can separately read the people cited below responding fully in their own words</a>, with lots of great information I wasn&#8217;t able to explore. One other thing, we did suggest they mention their own investments to illustrate what they believe about the sector. )</p>
<h2>When the office is more of a luxury</h2>
<p>The pandemic combined with existing trends has made office renters “more akin to a consumer of a luxury product,” explains Clelia Warburg Peters, a venture partner at <a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/team/clelia-warburg-peters/">Bain Capital Ventures</a> and long-time proptech investor and real estate operator.</p>
<p>Landlords who have “largely been in a position of power since the 1950s” now have to put the customer first, she says. The “best landlords will recognize that they are going to be under pressure to shift from simply providing a physical space, to helping provide tenants with a multichannel work experience.”</p>
<p>This includes tangible additional services like software and hardware for managing employees as they travel between various office locations. But the market today also dictates a new attitude. “These assets will need to be provided in the context of a much more human relationship, focusing on serving the needs of tenants,” she says. “As lease terms inevitably shorten, tenants will need to be courted and supported in a much more active way than they have been in the past.”</p>
<p>The changes in office space may be more favorable to the supply side in suburban areas.</p>
<p>“Companies are going to have to offer employees space in an urban headquarters,” Zach Aarons of <a href="https://www.metaprop.vc/team/zach-aarons">MetaProp</a> tells me (his firm just published a <a href="https://www.metaprop.vc/research">very positive report</a> on the sector). But many will also want to offer ”some sort of office alternative in the suburbs so the worker can leave home sometimes but not have to take a one-hour train ride to get to the office when needed.”</p>
<p>“If we were still purchasing hard real estate assets like many of us on the MetaProp team used to do in previous careers,” he added, “we would be looking aggressively to purchase suburban office inventory.”</p>
<p>Most people thought that remote work was here for good and would impact the nature of office space in the future.</p>
<p>Adam Demuyakor, co-founder and managing director of <a href="https://www.wilshirelanepartners.com/">Wilshire Lane Partners</a>, is generally bullish on big cities, but he notes that startups themselves are already untethering from specific places. This is a key leading indicator, in TechCrunch’s opinion.</p>
<p>“Something that has been interesting to watch over the past year is how startups themselves have begun to evolve due to newfound geographic flexibility from the pandemic,” he observes. “Previously, startups (especially real-estate-related startups) felt pressure to be ‘headquartered’ near where their customers, prospective capital sources and pools of talent were located. However, we’ve seen this change over the past few months.”</p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="https://blog.initialized.com/2021/01/data-post-pandemic-silicon-valley-isnt-a-place/">recent report</a> by my former colleague Kim-Mai Cutler, now a partner at <a href="https://initialized.com/who/kim-mai">Initialized Capital</a>, highlights these trends in a regular survey of its portfolio companies. When the pandemic began, the Bay Area was still the number one place that founders said they’d start a company. Today, remote-first is in first place. Meanwhile, the portfolio companies are either going toward remote-first or a hub-and-spoke model of a smaller headquarters and more far-flung offices. Those who maintain some sort of office say they will require significantly less than five days a week. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they would also not adjust salaries based on location!</p>
<p>That’s a small sample but as Demuyakor says, “Startups (a) are frequently the most adept at utilizing the types of technology necessary for effective remote work and (b) simultaneously have to compete ferociously for talent. As such, I think we may be able to infer what the ‘future of work’ may look like as we observe what startups choose to do as the pandemic passes.”</p>
<p>Some landlords (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/084f94e8-84a8-4966-a38b-fcb0b5e6171e">with big loans</a>) and large cities (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/nyregion/coronavirus-work-return-nyc.html">with big budgets</a>) are making a push to repopulate their offices quickly, and some large companies are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shimonshkury/2021/03/01/amazon-and-tech-are-leading-nycs-office-recovery/">loading up</a> on office space or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-economy-ceos-idUSKBN2BF00B">reaffirming</a> their commitments to current locations.</p>
<p>Maybe efforts like these, plus the natural desire to network live, will bring back the industry clusters and pull everyone back to the old geographies? Maybe something close to 100% of what we saw before? What does that look like?</p>
<p>In such a scenario, some pandemic-era changes will persist, says Christopher Yip, a partner and managing director at <a href="https://www.ret.vc/team/">RET Ventures</a>. “A populace that has become sensitized to public health considerations may well gravitate toward solo forms of transportation (cars and bicycles) instead of mass transit, and parking-related and bike-sharing tech tools may likely thrive. From a real estate management perspective, technology that makes high-density living more comfortable and healthier will also increase, as consumers will become increasingly attracted to touchless technology and tools that facilitate self-leasing.”</p>
<p>Here’s the other scenario that he lays out “if a large number of jobs remain fully remote.”</p>
<p>“In theory, retail and office properties could structurally continue to suffer, and there has been some talk from government officials in certain regions about converting office properties into affordable housing,” he details. “If market-rate vacancies in cities remain high, there will be increasing demand for short-term rental platforms like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://kasa.com/">Kasa</a>, which enable landlords to gain revenue from hotel-type stays even in a market where residential demand is not strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vik Chawla, a partner at <a href="https://fifthwall.com/team/vik-chawla">Fifth Wall</a>, sketches out a middle-of-the-road scenario. “We believe that major cities will continue to attract knowledge workers and top talent post-pandemic,” he says, “though we expect remote work to become an increasingly critical component to the work economy, meaning that there will be increased flexibility in terms of time spent in the office versus elsewhere.”</p>
<p>This would still mean some sort of long-term price decline. “At a city level, this means that rents should taper relative to pre-pandemic levels due to lesser demand,” he believes. “That said, the real estate ecosystems in cities that have experienced growth throughout the pandemic will enter a period of innovation, and with it, see an increase in housing density, ADUs and modular building techniques.”</p>
<p>Andrew Ackerman, managing director of UrbanTech for <a href="https://www.dreamit.com/team">DreamIt Ventures</a>, also sees a gentle deflation of commercial office prices over time, followed by some complex space-management questions.</p>
<p>“[T]he return to work will likely result in more flexible work arrangements rather than <a href="https://www.propmodo.com/reports-of-the-demise-of-the-office-are-greatly-exaggerated/">the demise of the office</a> which, as leases renew over the next 5-10 years, will lead to a gradual meaningful-but-not-catastrophic reduction in the demand for office space. The question is, what then happens to the excess office space?”</p>
<p>“Office to residential conversion is tricky,” he elaborates. “Layout is a major constraint. Many modern offices have deep, windowless interior space that is hard to repurpose. But even with narrow layouts, the structural elements are often in the wrong place. Drilling thousands of holes in structural concrete so you can move plumbing and gas to the right places is a heavy lift.”</p>
<p>This might just lead to new types of still-valuable uses? “One of the areas that I’m still investigating is whether co-living or microunits might be a more attractive conversion option. Turning an office break room and interior bullpens into a shared kitchen, dining area, and recreation or work flexspace may be a better way to repurpose deep interior space without a very costly retrofit. And if you don’t have to reroute too much plumbing, it may even be possible to convert (and convert back!) individual floors as market demand for office and residential space fluctuates over time.”</p>
<p>All respondents saw proptech being a core part of the next era of big cities (of course), however bullish or bearish they may be about the office itself.</p>
<h2>A new equilibrium for residential</h2>
<p>Housing availability has become even more limited in most places during the pandemic, with many more people looking to buy and fewer people wanting to sell. This is even though the previously hottest cities have seen major rental price drops.</p>
<p>Demuyakor of Wilshire Lane is staying focused on the housing problem, and solutions to it like co-living. “Despite the pandemic, it is still difficult for millennials and Gen Z to afford to live in the most expensive cities (New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, etc.) at current wage levels,” he says. “As such, we believe that we will continue to see demand for products and solutions that can continue to help alleviate costs and burdens of living in major cities. For example, we think that at its core, co-living is an economic decision. Solutions that continue to help people live where they want to live more easily (ADUs are another example of this) will continue to thrive.”</p>
<p>Casey Berman, managing director and general partner of <a href="https://www.cambercreek.com/casey">Camber Creek</a>, thinks that “cities will continue to attract people to live, work and play because they offer density and opportunities for experiences that people crave even more now. To the extent all of this is true, there will be renewed demand for urban spaces and properties to take advantage of that demand.”</p>
<p>He says that the firm has been investing in products to make dense living safer and more convenient and &#8220;we expect those solutions will become increasingly popular. <a href="https://getflex.com/">Flex</a> allows tenants to pay rent online in easier-to-manage installments and in the process makes it more likely that landlords will receive payment on time. <a href="https://www.latch.com/">Latch</a>’s access control devices are in one out of 10 new multifamily buildings. A lot of people purchased a pet over the past year. <a href="https://www.petscreening.com/">PetScreening</a> makes it easy to manage pet records and confirm when a pet is a service or support animal.”</p>
<p>Robin Godenrath and Julian Roeoes, partners at <a href="https://www.picuscap.com/">Picus Capital</a>, generally share this viewpoint and describe how new living arrangements in cities could allow for more radical changes to how people live.</p>
<p>“Flexible living solutions will allow remote workers to spend time across different cities with a fully managed, affordable and safe rental option for short-to-long-term urban living,” he says, “while commercial conversion to residential will play a key role in driving down per square foot prices enabling long-term returning residents to afford less densified space. Although co-living densifies multifamily buildings, we believe it will remain an interesting sector as the continued shift to remote work will make living communities increasingly important considering the reduced social interaction on the job.”</p>
<p>But modern proptech is also making the suburbs and beyond more appealing in the long run, according to many. Great new technologies for living can exist anywhere you are.</p>
<p>Proptech has also helped fuel the new suburban boom. “There is an ongoing trend of reverse urban migration causing an uptick in the demand for suburban-style living,” he says. “Proptech companies have played a significant role in enabling this shift, specifically via digitizing the home buying, selling and renting transaction processes (e.g., iBuyers, alternative financing models and tech-enabled brokerages). Additionally, proptech companies have played a key role in reducing physical interactions through remote appraisals, 3D/VR viewings and digital communications thus enabling homebuyers and sellers to efficiently and safely transact throughout the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, the same technologies that could make cities more affordable will also help out in the suburbs. “We strongly believe that the acceleration of the digitalization of the home transaction process coupled with the significant increase in demand for suburban-style housing and evolving buyer profiles (e.g., tech-savvy millennials) opens up a multitude of opportunities for proptech to significantly impact suburban living across construction, access and lifestyle. This includes companies focusing on built-to-rent developments, modular homebuilding, affordable housing, community building and digital amenities.</p>
<p>Many investors who we talked to highlighted the single-family rental market trend. Here’s Christopher Yip again from RET.</p>
<p>“One of the unheralded trends of the past decade has been the rise of the single-family rental (SFR) market,” he says “with a significant number of major investors moving into this asset class. The SFR space is poised to benefit from the migration from cities, and the tech that supports SFR will likely have positive ripple effects across the industry.”</p>
<p>“SFR portfolios are particularly challenging to operate efficiently and at scale; compared with a multifamily property, they have more distinct unit layouts and are more spread out geographically,” he explains. “Technology has the ability to streamline operations and maintenance for SFR operators, with smart home tools like <a href="https://smartrent.com/">SmartRent</a> facilitating self-touring and management of these distributed portfolios. We’re bullish on this space and are keeping a close eye on proptech tools that serve this market.”</p>
<p>Andrew Ackerman of DreamIt agrees. “Single-family has been neglected, slowly growing more interesting both from an asset and proptech perspective for some time. For example, we invested in startups like <a href="https://nestegg.rent/">NestEgg</a> and <a href="https://www.abodehq.com/">Abode</a> who service this ecosystem … prior to the pandemic. COVID has been good to these startups and brought more attention to the opportunities in single-family in general.”</p>
<p>Stonly Baptiste and Shaun Abrahamson, co-founders of <a href="https://urban.us/about-us/">Urban.us</a>, already see a world of options unfolding across geographies, with choices like co-living and short-term rentals letting people find new lifestyles. “Portfolio companies like <a href="https://starcity.com/">Starcity</a> are really thriving as co-living doesn’t just solve for cost, but also for a key overlooked issue — access to community. We also see room for more nomadic lifestyles. A lot of the discussion about Miami is about people moving there, but it seems like a more interesting question for a lot of places is maybe whether or not people will spend a few months of the year there. So for remote workers this might mean places near specific activities like mountain biking, surfing, snowboarding etc. Starcity makes it easy to move between city locations and <a href="https://www.kibbo.com/">Kibbo</a> takes this far beyond the city by building communities around van life.”</p>
<p>Here’s how all these changes are adding up for the suburban market, as mapped out by Clelia Warburg Peters of BCV.</p>
<p>“The residential transaction disruption is now settling in three core categories: iBuyers (who buy homes directly from sellers and ultimately hope to own the sell-side marketplace), neobrokers (who generally employ their agents and use secondary services such as title mortgage and insurance to increase their revenue) and elite agent tools (platforms or tools focused on the top agents).”</p>
<p>This combination of innovations are changing residential real estate as we know it. “[C]onsumers are increasingly open to alternative financing tools, including home-equity-based financing models (where you sell a stake in your home, or you buy into full ownership in a home over time). The growth and proliferation of these new models are consolidating the whole residential market so that brokerage sales commissions and commission from the sale of mortgage, title and home insurance are now functionally one large and intertwined disruptable market.”</p>
<h2>The surprising revival of neighborhood retail</h2>
<p>Humans seem to love the concept of a traditional Main Street full of bustling, walkable local businesses. But the hits have kept coming to the people trying to successfully operate independent retail storefronts.</p>
<p>E-commerce began cutting into traditionally thin margins with the rise of Amazon and the 90s wave of “e-tailers.” More recently, art galleries, high-end restaurants and boutiques became a harbinger of gentrification in many cities. Many commercial retail landlords in these locations aggressively priced rents as more residents moved in who could afford higher prices, ultimately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/06/nyregion/nyc-storefront-vacancy.html">contributing to gluts</a> of empty storefronts in prime locations.</p>
<p>The pandemic seemed to be the final blow, with even the most loyal shoppers turning to order online while local businesses stayed closed.</p>
<p>And yet, a range of investors are strangely optimistic. Even though the pandemic upended social and economic activity for more than a year, most agreed that IRL retail experiences are an essential aspect of modern life.</p>
<p>“Humans are fundamentally social animals and I think we will all be hungry for in-person experiences once it is safe to return to them. Additionally, I think the shift away from working five days a week in the office is going to create a greater desire for ‘third spaces’ — not home, not a formal office environment,&#8221; said Peters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think we will continue to see more ‘Apple store’-type retail experiences, where the focus is less on selling inventory and more on creating an environment for customers to physically interact with goods and experience the brand ethos beyond a website. Because I anticipate that retail rents are going to be meaningfully lower at the end of the pandemic, I actually think we will see even more experimentation than we did pre-COVID. It will be a very interesting period for retail.”</p>
<p>Many others held views in this direction, whether they are investing specifically in retail-related tech or more generally in third-space ideas.</p>
<p>“It’s true that retail has been in flux for more than a decade; the list of common e-commerce purchases has expanded from books and clothing to prepared meals and groceries. It’s also true that the pandemic has accelerated e-commerce’s growth, to the detriment of brick-and-mortar retail,&#8221; says RET&#8217;s Yip. &#8220;But people are still human and crave in-person experiences. Even if cities never bounce back fully, major metropolises will still have enough foot traffic to support a fair amount of retail, and innovative models like pop-up shops can be brought in to help address vacancies. It should also be noted that the public markets still have some confidence in the retail space. While the major REITs struggled in early to mid-2020, many have recovered substantially, and several have actually surpassed their pre-pandemic figures. It has been a bad decade for retail — and a very bad year — but it is just too soon to close the book on the sector.”</p>
<p>Godenrath and Roeoes of Picus say movie theaters are just one example of a retail sector poised for success when public life resumes at scale post-pandemic.</p>
<p>“Cinemas, many of which are key shopping center anchor tenants, were already reinventing the traditional theater experience by offering a more holistic experiential solution (e.g., reserved seating, 4DX visuals, in-theater restaurants, cafes and bars) and the pandemic has led to an expansion of these offerings (i.e., private theater rentals and events). We have the opinion that this trend will continue to expand across the entire retail real estate industry from restaurants (immersive culinary experiences) to traditional retail (integrated online and offline shopping experiences) and believe that proptech will play a defining role in helping retail real estate owners identify potential tenants and market properties as well as in helping retailers drive in-store customer engagement and gain key insights into the customer journey.”</p>
<p>The internet is also a friend these days, surprisingly! “We also see a lot of potential for hybrid models combining online and offline experiences without friction,” they say. “Taking the fitness sectors as an example we can imagine a new normal where in-studio courses are broadcasted to allow a broader participant group and apps tracking fitness and health progress throughout in-studio visits and at-home workouts.”</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>You can also see how retail intersects with many other solutions investors are betting on, particularly to improve the appeal of cities and solve for macro problems like climate change.</p>
<p>“Cities have some massively underutilized assets, perhaps the biggest being public spaces that are allocated to cars,” Baptiste and Abrahamson say. “So one change we think will become permanent is reallocating parking spaces away from private vehicles to micromobility (bike/scooter/board lanes, parking, etc.). We’re seeing a lot of demand for portfolio companies like <a href="https://www.coord.com/">Coord</a> (manages curb space starting with commercial vehicles and smart zones), <a href="https://en.qucit.com/">Qucit</a> (manages bike and scooter share operations in many large cities) and <a href="https://www.ooneepod.com/">Oonee</a> (secure bike/scooter/board parking).”</p>
<p>That’s just the start of the virtuous cycle they foresee.</p>
<p>“As [car removal] happens, the use cases like logistics can shift to electric micro-EVs. Similarly, parklets or seating areas increase social spaces. The EU is setting the pace for banning cars, but overall reduced access to streets for cars is going to be a big change. And likely will make cities attractive — yes, you give up private living space, but you’re going to get a lot more common/social space. This is also likely to drive more co-living so you can decrease the cost basis for being in a city, but get a lot more from shared spaces, which have no real comparison in lower density communities.”</p>
<p>Demuyakor of Wilshire Lane is betting in the same direction.</p>
<p>“One of the key tenets of our overall strategy has always been a focus on space utilization and identifying the best ways technology can monetize underutilized spaces. This can be seen clearly with many of our newest investments:<a href="https://stufstorage.com/"> Stuf</a> and<a href="https://www.neighbor.com/host"> Neighbor</a> (monetization of basements, parking garages and other vacant spaces),<a href="https://mealco.co/"> MealCo</a> (monetization of vacant kitchens),<a href="https://workchew.com/"> WorkChew</a> (monetization of restaurant seating areas, hotel lobbies and conference rooms), and<a href="https://www.saltbox.com/"> Saltbox</a> (monetization of empty warehouses). We believe that landlords can certainly use these types of strategies to help mitigate increased levels of vacancies that we’re seeing across the real estate industry today in the medium term.”</p>
<p>If this thesis pans out, retail may become more about shared spaces. “With WorkChew in particular, which<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/workchew-lands-2-5m-to-turn-hotels-and-restaurants-into-flexible-workspaces/"> just announced funding this week</a>, we&#8217;re seeing a ton of demand for their product both on the demand side and the supply side. Hotels and restaurants are excited to partner with them to monetize their less-utilized spaces and infrastructure,&#8221; said Demuyakor. &#8220;And of course, employers and companies love [it] as an easy amenity that can be offered to their hybrid workforces that increasingly want to spend more time out of the HQ office.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a few additional reasons to believe in the future of retail that I didn’t hear explicitly from the investors I interviewed.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-it-insane-to-start-a-business-during-coronavirus-millions-of-americans-dont-think-so-11601092841">millions </a>of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/400ae372-0cb2-48bb-8767-7986848ed9a6">new businesses</a> have been created during the pandemic, to the surprise of even economists and policymakers. A large portion appear to have a very local angle, whether food delivery (cupcakes) or services (on-site haircuts) or internet-first products with strong local followings (much of Etsy). These entrepreneurs went internet-first and now, as commercial rents plummet, they have sufficient revenue to support a physical presence.</li>
<li>Second, most local business that have sustained themselves during the COVID-19 era figured out how to succeed on the internet. To see which ones in your vicinity are weathering the storm, just open one of your preferred on-demand delivery and services apps and place an order.</li>
<li>Third, as noted by respondents and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-hurt-many-small-businesses-for-some-entrepreneurs-it-opened-doors-11615651202">available data</a>, landlords are already starting to drop prices, creating a renter&#8217;s market for the first time in decades.</li>
<li>Fourth, there are whole new types of financing opening up to more traditional businesses that could enable any company with a successful online side hustle, hobby (or perhaps larger project) to get funding for expansion. (This reason is perhaps the most speculative, but we are trying to figure out the future here at TechCrunch.) For example, Shopify has <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://alexdanco.com/2021/03/10/pipe-it-platforms-funding-and-the-future/%5d">just invested</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in Pipe.com, a new “platform for trading recurring revenue.” Although the companies are not saying much now about the relationship, it’s possible to imagine a bunch of successful small(ish) businesses on Shopify suddenly getting a new kind of capital infusion right as the math is suddenly much better for a storefront location.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you roll all of this up with other broader shifts in how we think about cities, like making them more climate-friendly through allowing density and bike lanes, you can start to see a world emerging that sounds a lot more like the fantasies of a New Urbanist than the world before the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, these concepts are being deployed across smaller cities, suburbs and towns: All will compete to offer the highest quality of living — unless the old network effects of industry clusters return miraculously.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s say the industry clusters don&#8217;t cluster like they used to. It&#8217;s possible that many landlords, lenders and city budgets <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/948ff4ff-f43b-47cb-9067-7c14badfc34e">will have to retrench soon</a>, creating a drag on the economies of otherwise-attractive cities.</p>
<p>Even in this case, you can imagine a rebirth for places like New York and San Francisco focused around housing, retail and amenities. Maybe one day, we’ll look back at recent decades as the bad old days before we collectively bottomed out during the pandemic and had to decide on the right answers for the long-term.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And with that, I invite readers to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/">check out the full sets of responses from the investors I interviewed</a>.

<p>Seeking answers, I surveyed the people who are betting on the biggest and most surprising changes in the sector — proptech investors. While landlords and their lenders may hope for a return to the past, proptech investors are focused on where the notion of place is going in the future. I have an in-depth writeup with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/the-return-of-neighborhood-retail-and-other-surprising-real-estate-trends/">many excerpts and my thoughts over on TechCrunch</a>, including a look at the revival of neighborhood retail, the rebirth of cities and much more.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t get into all of the great topics, though, including the rapid recent evolution of the residential sales and rental market, construction tech, related climate-tech topics and other issues.</p>

<h2>Clelia Warburg Peters, venture partner, Bain Capital Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>As the pandemic hopefully enters its final stages, how are the changes from this period affecting your real estate and proptech investment strategy? Are big trends of the present, like high nationwide housing demand and mass commercial vacancies, refocusing your investing strategy?</strong></p>
<p>Above all, I think COVID will prove to be an accelerant to existing trends in both the residential and commercial space. I like to think of it as a decade of innovation acceleration in 24 months.</p>
<p>The pandemic has certainly refocused attention on life at home, and that combined with low interest rates has undeniably made this an incredible period for companies that touch the housing market. Given that I got into proptech through work at a family residential brokerage, this market has always been a big area of interest for me, and I would observe that we were in the midst of some major shifts in this market pre-COVID. The residential transaction disruption is now settling in three core categories: iBuyers (who buy homes directly from sellers and ultimately hope to own the sell-side marketplace), neobrokers (who generally employ their agents and use secondary services such as title mortgage and insurance to increase their revenue) and elite agent tools (platforms or tools focused on the top agents). Additionally, consumers are increasingly open to alternative financing tools, including home-equity-based financing models (where you sell a stake in your home, or you buy into full ownership in a home over time. The growth and proliferation of these new models are consolidating the whole residential market so that brokerage sales commissions and commission from the sale of mortgage, title and home insurance are now functionally one large and intertwined disruptable market. In this context, while some of the valuations we are seeing may be a little euphoric, I think there is no doubt that we are in a period of massive and sustainable innovation in how we buy and hold our homes and I think these trends are going to be enduring.</p>
<p>In the commercial arena, we were also in the midst of a meaningful shift in how companies were conceiving of office space, in many ways thanks to the innovations that WeWork brought to the market. But the pandemic has pushed this much further, fundamentally shifting the relationship between the landlord/manager (who has largely been in a position of power since the 1950s) and the tenant (who is now in a position of much greater power, more akin to a consumer of a luxury product). As a result of this, I think the best landlords will recognize that they are going to be under pressure to shift from simply providing a physical space, to helping provide tenants with a multichannel work experience. This might mean a physical/digital hybrid of systems that include access control, physical space management (both in the hub location and potentially in spoke locations), and a digital space for meetings and collaboration. These assets will need to be provided in the context of a much more human relationship, focusing on serving the needs of tenants. As lease terms inevitably shorten, tenants will need to be courted and supported in a much more active way than they have been in the past.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the big cities adapting to life after the pandemic — or will they? What solutions are you focusing on in particular for the future of urban living (co-living, ADUs, commercial conversion to residential, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>I think the experience of cities after the pandemic is going to be highly variable — for instance, the trajectories for Austin and New York will likely look radically different. I am personally uncertain about how co-living, or even commercial to residential conversion will be at play, but I do believe that there will be a few consistent areas of interest.</p>
<p>First, smaller-scale urban life will continue to be a significant trend. I think we will continue to see a proliferation of bike lanes, a focus on living in walkable neighborhoods, and a reliance on tools (such as the app Nextdoor) that reinforce our feeling of connection to our neighbors.</p>
<p>Second, I think we will continue to see a reliance on certain types of outsourced services — ghost kitchens for takeout or rapid provision of groceries and other essentials — and technologies and spaces that facilitate these will be a growth area.</p>
<p>Finally, I do believe that in some more sprawling urban environments ADUs will be an area of growth, particularly with seniors who are looking for an additional income stream so they can age at home. One caveat is that I think this will be something of a winner-takes-all space with a limited number of geographically dominant winners.</p>
<p><strong>The demand for suburban-style living is back — for now. What are you focusing on across this category for the next year or two (new residential services and amenities, build-to-rent housing developments, etc.)?</strong></p>
<p>The current transition out of urban environments and into suburban environments is playing out alongside some broader changes in the way the American public seems to be approaching homeownership. Over the past decade, there has been a net decline in homeownership and a net growth in renting. Some of this is by necessity, and some is by choice. I think one component of the tech-related opportunity in the migrations we see now will be around rental platforms and multifamily amenitization. There is still no data aggregator like the MLS on the rental side, and a number of portals (including Zillow Rentals, Apartment List, Zumper, RentalBeast and others) are competing to provide listing information to consumers. On the multifamily side, many multifamily operators are understanding that the integration of work/life/play is creating a new need for amenitization and greater services in their offerings. I think we will continue to see more and more emphasis on hospitality-style brand creation in the multifamily space, and much of this will be facilitated by different kinds of tech-facilitated amenities.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note the flood of both institutional and private investor money that is coming into the single-family rental space. (It may be that in the future a certain percent of the population is renting their primary home, but exposed to the property market through ownership of these kinds of real estate assets.) This growth is being facilitated by property management services like Mynd, marketplaces like Roofstock, and innovative products like Zibo or Knox Financial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Medical and biotech had a strong showing at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day</a>, with nearly a dozen companies in the space catching my eye. The things a startup can accomplish in this space are astonishing these days, so don&#8217;t be surprised if a few of these companies are headline news in the next year.</p>
<h2>Startups take on big pharma</h2>
<p><a href="https://atombioworks.com/">Atom Bioworks</a> has one of the shortest timelines and highest potential impacts; as I wrote in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">second set of favorites from demo day</a>, the company seems to be fairly close to one of the Holy Grails of biochemistry, a programmable DNA machine. These tools can essentially &#8220;code&#8221; a molecule so that it reliably sticks to a specific substance or cell type, which allows a variety of follow-up actions to be taken.</p>
<p>For instance, a DNA machine could lock onto COVID-19 viruses and then release a chemical signal indicating infection before killing the virus. The same principle applies to a cancer cell. Or a bacterium. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Atom&#8217;s founders have published the details of their techniques in Nature Chemistry, and the company says it&#8217;s working on a COVID-19 test as well as therapies for the virus and other conditions. It expects sales in the nine-figure range.</p>
<p>Another company along these lines is <a href="https://www.liliumx.com/">LiliumX</a>. This company is going after &#8220;biospecific antibodies,&#8221; which are kind of like prefab DNA machines. Our own antibodies learn to target various pathogens, waste and other items the body doesn&#8217;t want, and customized, injected antibodies can do the same for cancer cells.</p>

<p>LiliumX is taking the algorithmic approach to generating potential antibody structures that could be effective, as many AI-informed biotech companies have before it. But the company is also using a robotic testing setup to thin the herd and get <em>in vitro</em> results for its more promising candidates. Going beyond lead generation is a difficult step, but one that makes the company that much more valuable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entelexo.com/">Entelexo</a> is one step further down the line, having committed to developing a promising class of therapeutics called exosomes that could help treat autoimmune diseases. These tiny vesicles (think packages for inter-cell commerce) can carry all kinds of materials, including customized mRNA that can modify another cell&#8217;s behavior.</p>

<p>Modifying cell behavior systematically could help mitigate conditions like multiple sclerosis, though the company did not elaborate on the exact mechanism — probably not something that can be explained in less than a minute. They&#8217;re already into animal testing, which is surprising for a startup.</p>
<p>One step further, at least mechanically, is <a href="https://www.nuntiustx.com/">Nuntius Therapeutics</a>, which is working on ways to deliver cell-specific (i.e. to skeletal muscle, kidney cells, etc.) DNA, RNA and CRISPR-based therapies. This is an issue for cutting-edge treatments: while they can be sure of taking the correct action once in contact with the target cell type, they <em>can&#8217;t</em> be sure that the therapeutic agent will ever reach those cells. Like ambulance drivers without an address, they can&#8217;t do their jobs if they can&#8217;t get there.</p>

<p>Nuntius claims to have created a reliable way to deliver genetic therapy payloads to a variety of target cells, beyond what major pharma companies like Moderna have accomplished. The company also develops and licenses its own drugs, so it&#8217;s practically a one-stop shop for genetic therapies if its techniques pan out for human use.</p>
<p>Beyond providing therapeutics, there is the evolving field of artificial organs. These are still highly experimental, partly due to the risk of rejection even when using biocompatible materials. <a href="http://www.trestlebio.com/">Trestle Biotherapeutics</a> is taking on a specific problem — kidney failure — with implantable lab-grown kidney tissue that can help get these patients off dialysis.</p>
<p>While the plan is to eventually create full kidney replacements, the truth is that for people with this condition, every week and month counts. Not only does it improve their chances of finding a donor or moving up the list, but regular dialysis is a horrible process by all accounts. Anything that reduces the need to rely on it would be welcomed by millions.</p>
<p>This Yale-Harvard tie-up comes from a team with quite a bit of experience in stem cell science and tissue engineering, including 3D printing human tissues — which no doubt is part of the approach.</p>
<h2>Beyond therapy</h2>
<p>Moving beyond actual techniques for fighting various conditions, the YC batch had quite a few dedicated to improving the process of researching and understanding those conditions and techniques.</p>
<p>Many industries rely on cloud-based document platforms like Google Docs for sharing and collaboration, but while copywriters and sales folks probably find the standard office suite sufficient, that&#8217;s not necessarily the case for scientists whose disciplines demand special documentation and formatting.</p>
<p><a href="https://curvenote.com/">Curvenote</a> is a shared document platform built with these folks in mind; it integrates with Jupyter, SaturnCloud and Sagemaker, supports lots of import and export options, integrates visualization plug-ins like Plotly, and versions through Git. Now you just have to convince the head of your department it&#8217;s worth paying for.</p>

<p>A more specialized cloud tool can be found in <a href="https://pipebio.com/">Pipe | bio</a>, which does hosted bioinformatics for developing antibody drugs like LiliumX. It&#8217;s hard to get into details here beyond that the computational and database needs of companies in biotech can be very specific and not everyone has a bioinformatics specialist on staff.</p>
<p>Having a tool you can just pay for instead of getting a data science grad student to moonlight for your lab is almost always preferable. (Also preferable is not using special characters in your company name — just saying, it&#8217;s going to come up.)</p>

<p>Special tools can be found on the benchtop as well as the laptop, though, and the remaining companies are firmly in meatspace.</p>

This is a difficult thing to observe systematically, but important for many reasons.</p>
<p>The company uses a micropatterned surface to observe individual cells and watch specifically for contraction and other shape changes. Physical constriction or relaxation of cells is at the heart of several major diseases and their treatments, so being able to see and track it will be extremely helpful for researchers.</p>
<p>The company has positioned itself as a way to test drugs at scale that affect these properties and claims to have already found promising compounds for lung fibrosis. Forcyte&#8217;s team is published in Nature, and received a $2.5 million SBIR award from the NIH, a pretty rare endorsement.</p>

<p><a href="https://kilobaser.com/">Kilobaser</a> is taking aim at the growing DNA synthesizing space; companies often contract with dedicated synthesizing labs to create batches of custom DNA molecules, but at a small scale this might be better done in-house.</p>
<p>Kilobaser&#8217;s benchtop machine makes the process as simple as using a copier, even for people with no technical know-how. As long as it has some argon, a reagent supply and microfluidic chip (sold by the company, naturally), it can replicate DNA you submit digitally in less than two hours. This could accelerate testing in many a small lab that&#8217;s held back by its reliance on a separate facility. The company has already sold 15 machines at €15,000 each — but like razor blades, the real money is in the refills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129814" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/reshape1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129814" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2129814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/reshape1.gif" alt="Video of a robotic arm filling vials." width="640" height="351" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2129814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reshape Biotech</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://reshapebiotech.com/">Reshape Biotech</a> is perhaps the most straightforward of the bunch. Its approach to automating common lab tasks is to create custom robots for each one. That&#8217;s it! Of course, that&#8217;s easier said than done, but given the similarity of many lab layouts and equipment, a custom robotic sampler or autoclave could be adopted by thousands as (again) an alternative to hiring another part-time grad student.</p>
<p>There were several other companies in the biotech and medical space worth looking at in the batch, but not enough space here to highlight them individually. Suffice it to say that the space is increasingly welcoming to startups as advances in tech and software are brought to bear where insuperable barriers to entry once left such possibilities remote.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I grew up in poverty in upstate New York, but I was lucky enough to study engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I founded a company that went public when I was 28, and I used that wealth to invest in startups.</p>
<p>It’s been exhilarating to watch many founders flourish, but when I return to upstate New York, the desolate remains of long-closed factories remind me of the sectors that the tech revolution never reached.</p>
<p>The numbers behind those empty facades could not be more dire. In late 2019, even before COVID struck, U.S. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-29/manufacturing-is-now-smallest-share-of-u-s-economy-in-72-years">manufacturing fell</a> to 11% of GDP, <em>the lowest level in 72 years</em>. We ceded much of that ground to low-cost competitors in China, which became the world’s top manufacturer back in 2011. We now have only a small window of time to restore manufacturing as a foundation of American prosperity, and a remarkable but underappreciated federal program has a big role to play.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My firm, <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>, specializes in running programs that help founders take technically difficult ideas from research to product. Many of these companies represent the future of American industry, especially when it comes to such national priorities as industrial automation and decarbonization.</p>
<p>You might think those startups would be ripe for venture investment, but in reality, only a fraction of venture capital flows to them. They are simply too risky compared with categories like SaaS and consumer.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			SBIR’s brilliant design has helped thousands of technology-minded entrepreneurs cross the chasm from research to real products, new markets and venture backing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That is exactly why in 1982 the U.S. Congress established the <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/">Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program</a>, which, in the words of its founder, Roland Tibbetts, aimed to “provide funding for some of the best early-stage innovation ideas — ideas that, however promising, are still too high risk for private investors, including venture capital firms.”</p>
<p>For a little more than $3 billion per year in contracts and grants disbursed by federal agencies, the SBIR has produced 70,000 patents, $41 billion in follow-on venture capital investments and <em>700 public companies</em>.</p>
<p>SBIR’s brilliant design has helped thousands of technology-minded entrepreneurs cross the chasm from research to real products, new markets and venture backing. We’ll need thousands more brilliant scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs to step up in the decade ahead. They can do this from their garage, but they can’t do it out of thin air. Congress should act quickly to create an “SBIR 2.0” with three critical improvements over how SBIR works today.</p>
<p>First, we need <em>at least 10 times more SBIR funding</em>. Even at $30 billion, SBIR’s funding would be a rounding error compared to many budgets in Washington, like $693 billion for defense in 2020, and just a fraction of total U.S. venture investing, which in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day/">reached $156 billion</a>. Yet, arguably, nothing in the federal budget could do more to help American industry.</p>
<p>Second, we need to focus new SBIR funding on critical strategic areas, especially decarbonization and advanced manufacturing. The first will save humanity’s future on this planet. The second will help us leap over our missed generation of manufacturing investment to establish leads in critical areas, including robotics, battery technology, artificially intelligent devices and additive manufacturing. Who could ask for better markets?</p>
<p>Finally, the review and reward process needs to be fast. One great example is the innovative U.S. Air Force “pitch day” programs in 2019 and 2020, which granted funds to the best founder pitches (carefully pre-qualified) in a matter of minutes. In our almost frictionless market for talent, long waits to deliberate and disburse funds is not a winning approach.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s late-February issuance of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/executive-order-on-americas-supply-chains/">executive order</a> on America’s supply chains suggests that the White House is already working hard on policy measures. No doubt the administration’s effort will draw on many approaches, but the key must be a relentless focus on America’s primary unspent fuel: the ingenuity and drive of our people.</p>
<p>We will only pull the depressed regions of this country out of poverty by giving them the tools to, with their own hands, rebuild American manufacturing through entrepreneurship.</p>

If the startup does its job right, it can help bring<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/102/2/604/2972079"> earlier diagnosis </a>to women around the world.</p>
<p>“The big issue around polycystic ovary syndrome is that there [are] a lot of different symptoms, and very often women take a long time to actually get diagnosed in the right manner,” CEO and co-founder Shashwata Narain said. “We want to provide a higher level and quality of guidance so she can have open eyes experience as she goes through her treatment process.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Veera Health’s subscription-based program takes the medical history of a patient to better understand symptoms and any existing reports. About 60% to 70% of the patients that Veera Health has worked with so far are pre-diagnosed and are looking for a solution, so the startup then starts to pick apart potential risk factors and suggests a holistic treatment plan. The startup has a team of specialists, from clinical nutritionists to dermatologists and gynecologists, that it works with on a contractual basis to approve any plan given to a patient. The startup has employed a number of care managers, which is basically an employee in charge of handling weekly and daily communication with the patient about these plans.</p>
<p>The company uses <a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1412644/PCOS_Evidence-Based-Guidelines_20181009.pdf">published research </a>on assessment and management of PCOS as a framework for its suggestions.</p>
<p>Veera Health officially launched three months ago and already has made $10,000 in revenue, growing at 300% month over month in paid customers.</p>
<p>Veera Health isn&#8217;t covered by insurance, so patients pay out of pocket for the services. In India, Narain says, outpatient care is “almost entirely an out-of-pocket market” and insurance is largely focused on hospitalization expenses. By using Veera Health, the co-founder estimates that by aggregating all these services into one spot, Veera Health can stop customers from spending “thousands and thousands of rupees” and playing specialist hopscotch.</p>
<p>In fact, one study<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30373317/"> shows</a> that PCOS clinics have had a high retention in patients compared to other single-care providers.</p>
<p>The co-founder says the biggest challenge for Veera Health is educating women about how to prioritize their own health and get past the stigma of PCOS.</p>
<p>“It’s a challenge because you want to get as much information out there and make sure women are paying attention to their health, yet at the same time there’s a lot of stigma on [PCOS] and around women’s health to begin with.”</p>
<p>We know of at least one investor that thinks the conversation is ready to be had, anyway. Veera Health recently graduated from Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 cohort as one of the 39 companies based in India, the highest concentration from the accelerator yet.</p>
<p>Narain says that Veera Health is uniquely positioned to help women during the pandemic. Her sister and co-founder, Shobhita, was diagnosed with PCOS so experienced firsthand the confusing path to diagnosis.</p>
<p>“Because of the pandemic, there&#8217;s a lot more openness to online solutions,” she said. “People are at home, not able to exercise and are much more stressed out. This had a ramp up in the level of awareness on [PCOS] and the search for solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re old enough to remember the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/hearts-and-stars-twitter/">outrage</a> that followed Twitter&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/03/heart-heart-heart/">replace stars with hearts</a> (aka likes instead of favorites), then you know that Twitter&#8217;s user base has strong feelings about how it wants to engage with tweets. Now, Twitter is considering another radical change on this front that could shake things up yet again. The company has been surveying users throughout the month to get input on how they feel about a broader set of emoji-style reactions, similar to what you&#8217;d see on Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re exploring additional ways for people to express themselves in conversations happening on Twitter,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said of the survey.</p>
<p>Specifically, Twitter&#8217;s survey proposed a few different sets of reaction emojis, all of which include the heart (like), laughing face with tears (funny), thinking face (interesting) and crying face (sad).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2129773" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129773" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqdWEAAdoOd.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jdm0079/status/1372630471419469825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@jdm0079 on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It then proposed some variations on this basic set, where the &#8220;awesome&#8221; sentiment could be expressed with either the shocked face or fire emoji, or where a &#8220;support&#8221; sentiment could be indicated with either the hug emoji or the raised hands.</p>
<p>More controversially, Twitter is considering a way for users to signal a general like or dislike for the tweet with either a thumbs up or thumbs down, a &#8220;100&#8221; in either green or red to indicate &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree,&#8221; or a green up arrow icon or red down arrow icon, reminiscent of Reddit&#8217;s upvote and downvote mechanisms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129713" style="width: 316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129713" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?w=306" alt="" width="306" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=68,150 68w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=135,300 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=768,1706 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=306,680 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=692,1536 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuOc_VoAQQgaD.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/WFBrother/status/1374633883593887747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WFBrother on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The survey questions demonstrated that Twitter is aware of the challenges that come with introducing emoji reactions that could imply negative sentiments. It asked the respondents how they would want to take advantage of a downvote or dislike, for example &#8212; whether they would use the reaction instead of replying to a tweet, or whether they would downvote irrelevant or offensive tweets, as well.</p>
<p>Twitter also asked how users would feel if their own tweets were downvoted and whether that would discourage them from tweeting in the future, or if they would take it more as &#8220;constructive&#8221; feedback about their content. (Ha!)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129796" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129796" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2129796" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EwyQIqiWEAAEUsw.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129796" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/jdm0079/status/1372630471419469825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@jdm0079 on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The company clearly understands that the introduction of reaction sets could have a significant impact on how people engage with Twitter content and, potentially, could even lead to a chilling effect on Twitter usage if people became overly concerned about having their tweets downvoted.</p>
<p>That said, the upvote and downvote mechanism &#8212; whether as thumbs or arrows or anything else &#8212; remains a common way to engage with content elsewhere on the web. This includes not only forum sites like Reddit and others, but also YouTube, Imgur and Pandora, to name a few. A &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; signal by itself, meanwhile, is even more popular thanks to Facebook&#8217;s lead. But today, this like button can also take the shape of an arrow, heart or just a box to click &#8212; like when you mark an Amazon.com user review as &#8220;Helpful,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the use of expanded emoji reactions has become more common since Facebook&#8217;s emoji reaction set <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/with-reactions-facebook-supercharges-the-like-button-with-6-empathetic-emoji/">debuted in 2015.</a> Since then, other social media sites adopted their use, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/linkedin-adds-a-range-of-reactions-to-spur-more-engagement-in-conversations/">like LinkedIn.</a> Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/twitter-dms-now-have-emoji-reactions/">even added emoji reactions to its DMs</a> (direct messages) last year.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s survey additionally asked users about how the thought the emoji reactions should be displayed &#8212; like whether negative reaction counts should be visible, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2129793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2129793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2129793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExOuNzWVcAEsl4H.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2129793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/WFBrother/status/1374633883593887747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@WFBrother on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch the work it&#8217;s doing in the space of reactions is exploratory &#8212; it&#8217;s only running this survey now because the company is thinking about ways people could add more nuance to the conversations they&#8217;re having, and how, by doing so, readers would be able to better understand the additional context around those conversations. Plus, Twitter notes that the new emoji reactions would not replace the &#8220;heart;&#8221; they&#8217;re additive.</p>
<p>But although Twitter hasn&#8217;t yet built out its emoji reaction set or put it into testing, it appears it&#8217;s on the path to do so.</p>
<p>In response to a user&#8217;s recent request to test emoji reactions instead of just hearts, Twitter Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1372717290295238658">replied</a>, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have something for you soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook on Wednesday announced new actions to disrupt a network of China-based hackers leveraging the platform to compromise targets in the Uyghur community.</p>
<p>The group, known to security researchers as &#8220;Earth Empusa,&#8221; &#8220;Evil Eye&#8221; or &#8220;Poison Carp&#8221; targeted around 500 people on Facebook, including individuals living abroad in the United States, Turkey, Syria, Australia and Canada. Through fake accounts on Facebook, the hackers posed as activists, journalists and other sympathetic figures in order to send their targets to compromised websites beyond Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s security and cyberespionage teams began seeing the activity in 2020 and opted to disclose the threat publicly to maximize the impact on the hacking group, which has proven sensitive to public disclosures in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Facebook says social engineering efforts on the platform are &#8220;a piece of the puzzle,&#8221; most of the hacking group&#8217;s efforts take place elsewhere online. They focus on attempts to gain access to targets&#8217; devices with watering hole attacks and lookalike domains, including a fake Android app store offering prayer apps and Uyghur-themed keyboard downloads.</p>
<p>When downloaded, those fake apps infected devices using two strains of Android trojan malware, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/f/new-android-spyware-actionspy-revealed-via-phishing-attacks-from-earth-empusa.html">ActionSpy</a> and PluginPhantom. On iOS devices, the hackers leveraged malware known as Insomnia.</p>
<p>While the hackers targeted a small number of users relative to what the company sees in disinformation operations, Facebook stressed that a small, well-chosen group of targets can result in huge impacts. &#8220;You can imagine surveillance, you can imagine a range of secondary consequences&#8221; Facebook Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said.</p>
<p>The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in China that continues to face brutal repression from the Chinese government, including being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-54277430">forced into labor camps</a> in the country&#8217;s Xinjiang province.</p>
<p>Facebook declined to link what it observed to the Chinese government, saying that it defers to the broader security community to make those determinations when it lacks the technical indicators to do so itself. Researchers believe that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/tibetans-iphone-android-hacks-uyghurs/"> adjacent hacking campaigns</a> are Beijing&#8217;s efforts to extend its surveillance of communities it already subjugates within China&#8217;s bounds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One year.</p>
<p>That’s how long Google gave developers to start implementing required changes to improve user experience. In early May 2020, Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience">published</a> a modest post on one of its developer blogs introducing <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en">Core Web Vitals</a> &#8212; a set of metrics that will result in major changes to the way websites are ranked by the search engine. In May 2021, Google will officially add those Core Web Vitals to the various other “page experience” signals it analyzes when deciding how to rank websites.</p>
<p>The quest to improve a website’s position in search results has spawned hundreds (if not thousands) of how-to articles over the years. Businesses that are scared about taking a hit to SEO from Google’s new metrics have been pushing developers to optimize company websites. At the same time, developers have been frustrated because there’s a lot that goes into user experience that isn’t reflected in the Core Web Vitals. A lot of details have to be juggled.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Aside from improved SEO, small business websites optimizing for the new metrics will reap the rewards of an improved user experience for their site visitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But what about the startups, tech companies and small business owners who handle their own websites in-house? What about the agencies and enterprise platforms that manage or host hundreds or even thousands of websites for clients? While many are looking at the Core Web Vitals as a big hoop to jump through to please the search powers that be, others are seeing &#8212; and seizing &#8212; the opportunities that come along with this change.</p>
<h2><strong>Improving user experience will be rewarded</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses wondering “What’s in it for me?” should recognize that if all other things are equal, optimizing for the Core Web Vitals is going to be a significant tiebreaker between websites. If a company’s site is ranking really well with these rigorous metrics, it will have an edge against competitors in searches when content and ranking are otherwise comparable.</p>
<p>Aside from improved SEO, small business websites optimizing for the new metrics will reap the rewards of an improved user experience for their site visitors. Internet users frequently complain about <a href="https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/website-load-time-statistics/">long wait times as pages are loading</a>, or problems with an entire page shifting just as the user goes to click a specific button &#8212; which results in them clicking the wrong button and causing further delays. For online retail websites, <a href="https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/blog/need-for-speed-slow-loading-websites-cost-retailers-nearly-60bn-in-lost-sales-each-year/">a poor user experience leads to lost revenue</a> as users abandon shopping carts and never return to a site. Once the Core Web Vitals go into effect, companies that have made the efforts to provide smooth and speedy performance for visitors will win out against competitors that retain sluggish designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investor FOMO following Roblox&#8217;s blockbuster public debut is pushing venture capitalists who missed out on that gaming giant to invest in competing platforms.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://recroom.com/">Rec Room</a> announced it has raised $100 million from Sequoia and Index, with participation from Madrona Venture Group. The deal is a huge influx of capital for Rec Room, which had raised less than $50 million before this round, including a $20 million Series C that closed in December. In 2019, we reported that the company had raised its Series B at a $126 million valuation, this latest deal values the company at $1.25 billion, showcasing how investor sentiment for the gaming space has shifted in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster growth.</p>
<p>Rec Room launched as a VR-only platform, but as headset sales creeped along slowly, the company embraced traditional game consoles, PC and mobile to expand its reach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press release accompanying today&#8217;s funding announcement, Rec Room detailed it has surpassed 15 million &#8220;lifetime users&#8221; and had shown 566% year-over-year revenue growth. In December, CEO Nick Fajt told TechCrunch that the company has tripled its player base in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The company has been following in Roblox&#8217;s footsteps in many ways as it build out its creator tools and seeks to build out an on-platform economy for game creators. The company says that 2 million players have created content on the platform and that Rec Room is on track to pay out more than $1 million to them this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A German court that&#8217;s considering Facebook&#8217;s appeal against a pioneering pro-privacy order by the country&#8217;s competition authority to stop combining user data without consent has said it will refer questions to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.olg-duesseldorf.nrw.de/behoerde/presse/Presse_aktuell/20210324_PM_Facebook2/index.php">press release</a> today the Düsseldorf court writes [translated by Google]: &#8221; … the Senate has come to the conclusion that a decision on the Facebook complaints can only be made after referring to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of whether Facebook is abusing its dominant position as a provider on the German market for social networks because it collects and uses the data of its users in violation of the GDPR can not be decided without referring to the ECJ. Because the ECJ is responsible for the interpretation of European law.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office, FCO)&#8217;s &#8220;exploitative abuse&#8221; case links Facebook&#8217;s ability to gather data on users of its products from across the web, via third-party sites (where it deploys plug-ins and tracking pixels), and across its own suite of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus), to its market power &#8212; asserting this data-gathering is not legal under EU privacy law as users are not offered a choice.</p>
<p>The associated competition contention, therefore, is that inappropriate contractual terms allow Facebook to build a unique database for each individual user and unfairly gain market power over rivals who don&#8217;t have such broad and deep reach into user&#8217;s personal data.</p>
<p>The FOC&#8217;s case against Facebook is seen as highly innovative as it combines the (usually) separate (and even conflicting) tracks of competition and privacy law &#8212; offering the tantalizing prospect, were the order to actually get enforced, of a structural separation of Facebook&#8217;s business empire without having to order a break up of its various business units up.</p>
<p>However enforcement at this point &#8212; some five years after the FCO started investigating Facebook&#8217;s data practices in March 2016 &#8212; is still a big if.</p>
<p>Soon after the FCO&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/german-antitrust-office-limits-facebooks-data-gathering/">February 2019</a> order to stop combining user data, Facebook succeeded in blocking the order via a court appeal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/facebook-succeeds-in-blocking-german-fcos-privacy-minded-order-against-combining-user-data/">August 2019</a>.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">last summer</a> Germany’s federal court unblocked the &#8220;superprofiling&#8221; case &#8212; reviving the FCO&#8217;s challenge to the tech giant&#8217;s data harvesting by default.</p>
<p>The latest development means another long wait to see whether competition law innovation can achieve what the EU&#8217;s privacy regulators have so far failed to do &#8212; with multiple GDPR challenges against Facebook still sitting undecided on the desk of the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p>
<p>Albeit, it&#8217;s fair to say that neither route looks capable of &#8220;moving fast and breaking&#8221; platform power at this point.</p>
<p>In its opinion the Düsseldorf court does appear to raise questions over the level of Facebook&#8217;s data collection, suggesting the company could avoid antitrust concerns by offering users a choice to base profiling on only the data they upload themselves rather than on a wider range of data sources, and querying its use of Instagram and Oculus data.</p>
<p>But it also found fault with the FCO&#8217;s approach &#8212; saying Facebook&#8217;s U.S. and Irish business entities were not granted a fair hearing before the order against its German sister company was issued, among other procedural quibbles.</p>
<p>Referrals to the EU&#8217;s Court of Justice can take years to return a final interpretation.</p>
<p>In this case the ECJ will likely be asked to consider whether the FCO has exceeded its remit, although the exact questions being referred by the court have not been confirmed &#8212; with a written reference set to be issued in the next few weeks, per its press release.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the court&#8217;s announcement today, a Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, the Düsseldorf Court has expressed doubts as to the legality of the Bundeskartellamt’s order and decided to refer questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union. We believe that the Bundeskartellamt’s order also violates European law.</p></blockquote>
