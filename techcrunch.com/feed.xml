										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://inaccord.com/">Accord</a>, an early stage startup focused on bringing order to B2B sales, are not your typical engineer founders. Instead, the two brothers, Ross and Ryan Rich, worked as sales reps seeing the problems unique to this kind of sale first-hand.</p>
<p>In November 2019, they decided to leave the comfort of their high-paying jobs at Google and Stripe to launch Accord and build what they believe is a missing platform for B2B sales, one that takes into account the needs of both the sales person and the buyer.</p>
<p>Today the company is launching with a $6 million seed round from former employer Stripe and Y Combinator. It should be noted that the founders applied to YC after leaving their jobs, and impressed the incubator with their insight and industry experience, even though they didn&#8217;t really have a product yet. In fact, they literally drew their original idea on a piece of paper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111480" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111480" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Original prototype of Accord sketched on a piece of paper." width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg 1106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111480" class="wp-caption-text">The original prototype was just a drawing of their idea. Image Credits: Accord</p></div></p>
<p>Recognizing they had the sales skills, but lacked programming chops, they quickly brought in a third partner, Wayne Pan to bring their idea to life. Today, they have an actual working program with paying customers. They&#8217;ve created a kind of online hub for B2B sales people and buyers to interact.</p>
<p>As co-founder Ross Rich points out these kinds of sales are very different from the consumer variety, often involving as many as 14 people on average on the buyer side. With so many people involved in the decision-making process, it can become unwieldy pretty quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide within the application shared next steps and milestones to align on and that the buyer can track asynchronously, a resource hub to avoid sorting through those hundreds of emails and threads for a single document or presentation and stakeholder management to make sure the right people are looped in at the right time,&#8221; Rich explained.</p>
<p>Accord also integrates with the company CRM like Salesforce to make sure all of that juicy data is being tracked properly in the sales database. At the same time, Rich says the startup wants to this platform to be a place for human interaction. Instead of an automated email or text, this provides a place where humans can actually interact with one another, and he believes that human element is important to help reduce the complexity inherent in these kinds of deals.</p>
<p>With $6 million in runway and a stint at Y Combinator under their belts, the founders are ready to make more concerted go-to-market push. They are currently at 9 people, mostly engineers aside from the two sales-focused founders. He figures to be bringing in some new employees this year, but doesn&#8217;t really have a sense of how many they will bring on just yet, saying that is something that they will figure out in the coming months.</p>
<p>As they do that, they are already thinking about being inclusive with several women on the engineering team, recognizing if they don&#8217;t start diversity early, it will be more difficult later on. &#8220;[Hiring a diverse group early] only compounds when you get to nine or 10 people and then when you&#8217;re talking to someone and they are wondering &#8216;do I trust this team and is that a culture where I want to work?&#8217; He says if you want to build a diverse and inclusive workplace, you have to start making that investment early.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for this team, but they are building a product to help B2B sales teams work more closely and effectively with customers, and with their background and understanding of the space, they seem well positioned to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai, which has developed a no-code platform for businesses, closed on a $2 million seed funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s SaaS platform aims to allow business users to structure any free-text data with custom categories built through a drag &amp; drop interface, based on AI-extracted concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Village Global led the financing, which included participation from new and existing backers including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceleprise, Oceans Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, 2.12 Angels, GTMFund, and Lorimer Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spain-born Jorge Penalva founded Lang.ai in 2018 with the goal of giving any business user the ability “to build enterprise-ready natural language processing models in just minutes.” It was built to give non-engineers a way to automate repetitive tasks in use cases such as customer service and claims processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can be installed in our cloud or theirs,” Penalva said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai saw its revenue double from the last quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 and the seed funding was motivated mainly to continue that momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re getting demand in the form of projects with our larger customers, so we needed the funding to be able to support that demand,” Penalva told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous role of CEO of Séntisis, Penalva realized that processes driven by free-text data remained a blind spot for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today, millions of dollars and hours are invested by companies to manually read and process textual information captured from disparate areas of their business,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mission with Lang.ai is to “empower businesses to put AI to work for them, without the technical complexities of building and training custom algorithms.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Penalva said that Lang.ai’s product analyzes a customer’s historical data “in minutes” and suggests AI-extracted concepts to build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom categories through a drag &amp; drop interface. The custom categories are applied in real-time to automate “tedious” tasks such as the manual tagging and routing of support tickets, the processing of insurance claims and the dispatching of field engineers to incoming work order requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Lang.ai’s goal is to remove the technical burden of implementing AI for a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai’s community of users (called “Citizen NLP Builders”) consists of mostly non-technical business roles, ranging from customer service operations to marketers, business analysts and UX designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers include Freshly, Userzoom, Playvox, Spain’s CaixaBank, Yalo Chat and Bancolombia, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Segal, director of infrastructural efficiency at Freshly, described the platform as “so nimble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Out of the box, it took us two days to make automated tagging 15% more reliable than a previous platform that we had had in production for 2 years, with the added benefit that now all of our teams can tap into and exploit our support data,” Segal said. “The marketing team has built workflows to understand key customer moments. Our data and analytics team is super excited about having all these new tags in Snowflake, and it’s crazy how easy it is to use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penalva is proud of the fact that Lang.ai’s engineering team is primarily based in Spain and that he has been able to grow the 10-person company outside of his native country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With very few resources, it took us a little over two years to build an enterprise-grade product and find the right set of early customers and investors who are aligned with our vision,” he said. “I moved to the US from Spain to build a global company and this is just the beginning&#8230;Lang has always been powered by immigrant hustle, and it has been core to our values since day 1.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei spoke rather diplomatically about the company’s hopes of holding talks with the new U.S. administration. The hardware giant is also taking a less conciliatory route, challenging its FCC designation as a national security threat.</p>
<p>The company this week filed a suit with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, calling the FCC ruling, “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion and not supported by substantial evidence.”</p>
<p>Questions have swirled around the smartphone maker’s ties to the Chinese government for years, but the U.S. greatly ramped up actions against Huawei during the Trump years. The federal government has taken a number of routes to essentially kneecap the company, including, notably, its addition to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list,” which effectively barred it from working with U.S. companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Huawei likely sees a change in U.S. governance as an opportunity to be reevaluated by the powers that be. The company has long denied spying and other security charges. &#8220;I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” Ren earlier this week told the media that he was eager to speak with Biden. “The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”</p>
<p>In a statement offered to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-files-u-s-lawsuit-disputing-it-is-a-security-threat-11612880705"> The Wall Street Journal</a>, however, an FCC spokesperson stayed firm to the 2020 decision, stating, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision.”</p>

<p>Thus far, the Biden administration hasn’t indicated any plans to soften restrictions on Huawei. Facing opposition from Republican lawmakers, Commerce Secretary nominee Gina Raimondo noted, “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration does appear to be reviewing other actions against Chinese companies taken during the Trump administration. Notably, a planned forced sale of TikTok’s U.S. wing has been put on hold while the White House reassesses security concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of social audio 1.0 is in full swing, and while podcasts and Clubhouse have led the way, there are many other audio startups joining the fold. <a href="https://www.beta.wearequilt.com/">Quilt</a>, an audio social network that focuses on wellness and community, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/">Mayfield Fund</a>, with partner Rishi Garg joining the board, to do just that.</p>
<p>Quilt started as a community platform founded by Ashley Sumner, which let local folks meet up with one another in their own homes. Sumner was on the founding team at NeueHouse and has spent her career building community through physical space. Thousands of Quilt conversations were happening out of peoples&#8217; homes until the pandemic struck in March, resulting in an existential crisis for the startup.</p>
<p>Sumner quickly moved Quilt over to Zoom but soon realized that video chat didn&#8217;t quite capture the magic that was happening in person, nor did it prove the right medium to foster the type of conversations that had made Quilt so special.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She worked to develop an audio app that would become the new Quilt 2.0, which went live in the App Store at the end of January.</p>
<p>Quilt allows anyone to start a room for a conversation, dropping a line or two of text to describe what they want to talk about. The app is focused on wellness, breaking rooms into three different categories: spiritual and personal development (with conversations around meditation, astrology, human design, etc.), career and purpose (&#8220;it was very important to link purpose to it,&#8221; said Sumner, &#8220;these aren&#8217;t networking events&#8221;), and relationships, sex, and family.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?w=680" alt="Quilt" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png 2960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=2048,1107 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Quilt</p></div></p>
<p>The platform has put specific focus on balancing the engagement levels of content creators and consumers. According to Quilt, 98 percent of hosts attend other hosts&#8217; conversations and more than 50 percent of Quilters talk during any given conversation.</p>
<p>Garg, who has spent nearly two decades in the emerging media space, talked about how the engagement ratio among creators, consumers and &#8216;bystanders&#8217; is different for each social platform based on the medium and product choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;With YouTube, the famous number was 1 percent create, 9 percent engage, and 90 percent sit back,&#8221; said Garg. &#8220;At Twitter, interestingly, it was 10 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent. If you look at something like Clubhouse, you&#8217;re seeing that parallel already happen. It&#8217;s like celebrity central. Part of what got us excited about Quilt was that anyone could just start a room. We really focused in on the pathway between being a consumer to being a creator. Starting or hosting a room is shorter than on any other social media platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the norms within the Quilt community are a big part of what makes that possible, saying there is a hurdle associated with platforms that are more celebrity driven or top heavy. Consumers look at the bar that is set by the community and feel they&#8217;re not famous enough, or don&#8217;t have a big enough community to contribute, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the magic of Quilt is that everyone can feel like they have something to offer,&#8221; Garg explained. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a lot more scalable and a lot less fragile than an ecosystem built entirely on celebrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Retention also seems to be strong in Quilt&#8217;s early days, with 80 percent of sign-ups coming back for conversations every week. The company also said that around 60 percent of conversations are started spontaneously, rather than being a planned and promoted &#8216;event.&#8217;</p>
<p>Sumner says that Quilt will never generate revenue through advertising, but rather employ a freemium model.</p>
<p>Existing investors such as Freestyle VC&#8217;s Jenny Lefcourt and Upside Partnership&#8217;s Kent Goldman and Christina Hunt also participated in this latest round alongside new investors, including Houseparty CEO Sima Sistani, The Mini Fund&#8217;s Eros Resmini, former Discord CMO Allison Stoloff, and others.</p>
<p>The Quilt team is currently made up of eight people, 50 percent of whom are female and 25 percent of whom are non-Black people of color. Twenty percent are LGBT and 10 percent are non-binary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The insane saga of a potential forced sale of TikTok&#8217;s US operations is reportedly ending — another victim of the transition to methodical and rational policymaking that appears to be the boring new normal under the Presidency of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Last fall, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation/">took a stab at &#8220;gangster capitalism&#8221;</a> by trying to force the sale of TikTok to a group of buyers including Oracle and Walmart.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gangster capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation/embed/#?secret=D4YX7R8mBF" data-secret="D4YX7R8mBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the effort was doomed from the start, with TikTok&#8217;s parent company ByteDance winning most of the legal challenges to the government effort, a Rubicon had effectively been crossed where the U.S. government appeared willing to spend political capital to stymie the growth of a successful foreign business on its shores for the flimsiest of security reasons.</p>
<p>Now, <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> is reporting that the efforts by the U.S. government to push the deal forward &#8220;have been shelved indefinitely&#8221;, citing sources familiar with the process.</p>
<p>However, discussions between TikTok and U.S. national security officials are continuing because there are valid concerns around TikTok&#8217;s data collection and the potential for manipulation and censorship of content on the app.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the U.S. is taking a look at all of the potential threats to data privacy and security from intrusions by foreign governments or using tech developed overseas, according to Emily Horne, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council.</p>
<div class="paywall">
<div class="media-object type-InsetRichText wrap scope-web article__inset article__inset--type-InsetRichText article__inset--wrap" data-layout="wrap " data-layout-mobile="">
<div class="media-object-rich-text">
<p>“We plan to develop a comprehensive approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face,” Horne told the WSJ. “This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the U.S. In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks we face.”</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">then-President Trump ordered a ban on TikTok</a> intending to force the sale of the Chinese-owned, short form video distribution service to a U.S.-owned investment group.</p>

<p>As part of that process, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. ordered ByteDance to divest of its U.S. operations.</p>
<p>TikTok appealed that order in court in Washington last November as the U.S. was roiled by the presidential election and its aftermath.</p>
<p>That case is still pending, but separate federal court rulings have blocked the U.S. government from shutting TikTok down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you want to make your website accessible right now but lack the resources for the kind of serious revamp it would take, an &#8220;accessibility overlay&#8221; may take the pressure off while the work gets done. Though critics argue that these tools aren&#8217;t a permanent solution, AccessiBe has raised $28 million to show that its approach is an important part of making the entire web available to everyone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a problem often faced by small businesses: their website may not have been built to modern <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">accessibility standards</a>, and not only needs a deep dive by professionals to fix, but ongoing work to keep up to date and fix errors. This sort of work can be very expensive, and SMBs may not have the cash to lay out. This is not only a bummer for anyone with a disability who visits the site, but it exposes the business to legal action.</p>
<p>At the enterprise level accessibility is increasingly becoming part of the development process, and startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/fable-aims-to-make-disability-inclusive-design-as-simple-as-a-service/">Fable</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/evinced-raises-17m-to-speed-up-accessibility-testing-for-the-web/">Evinced</a> are looking to push things forward there. For those whose development budgets compete with rent and food money, however, other approaches may be desired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fable aims to make disability-inclusive design as simple as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/fable-aims-to-make-disability-inclusive-design-as-simple-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=GXKxAfGo0C" data-secret="GXKxAfGo0C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AccessiBe is one of a few new services called accessibility overlays that claim to provide total ADA compliance and other features just by installing a line of javascript. If it sounds too good to be true&#8230; well, it is and it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What the overlay code does is scrub the whole website&#8217;s user-facing code for issues like unlabeled buttons, fields that aren&#8217;t addressable by keyboard navigation, images without alt text, and other common accessibility issues. AccessiBe&#8217;s system does so with the addition of machine learning to match features of the target site to those in its training database, so even if something is really poorly coded, it can still be recognized by its context or clear intention.</p>
<p>You can try it out yourself at a handful of websites by appending #showacsb: it&#8217;s live on <a href="https://www.everlast.com/#showacsb">Everlast</a>, <a href="https://www.tupperware.com/#showacsb">Tupperware</a>, and <a href="https://www.playmobil.us/#showacsb">Playmobil</a> (among many others).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2111009 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png" alt="Screenshot of the Everlast website with accessiBe's overlay on the right with options to adjust text and visuals." width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png 1807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=1536,982 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The result is a website that works in many ways as if it was designed with accessibility in mind, fixing a lot of the basic problems that prevent visitors with disabilities from using a site, and providing plenty of additional quality-of-life features like improving contrast, stopping animations, changing the font, etc. The overlay can be automatically activated or manually by users prompted by screen reader text that tells them how to do so.</p>
<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s agent scans the site regularly and updates what users will see, and the website owner pays monthly (<a href="https://accessibe.com/pricing">from $40 to a couple hundred a month</a> depending on the size of the site) to have the tool available. This demo video does a pretty good job of showing the problems the tool fixes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPucaklb1v4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>You may wonder how this could be considered anything but good for accessibility, but there&#8217;s serious debate over the role of overlays in considerations for how the web should be made more accessible. The implication of such a tool is that all that&#8217;s needed to make any website accessible is a single line of code. This leads to a couple problems.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s questionable whether automated processes like accessiBe&#8217;s (and others aimed at developers, like Evinced and AudioEye) can actually catch and fix every accessibility problem. There are many that slip past even the best analysis and others that resist automated fixes. (The company offers a <a href="https://ace.accessibe.com/">free assessment tool</a> in case you&#8217;re curious what it would and wouldn&#8217;t catch at your website.)</p>
<p>AccessiBe CEO Shir Ekerling said that this concern has been ameliorated by recent improvements to the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;AccessiBe scans and analyzes every website every day. We know, automatically, exactly what are the interactive elements of the site, where people click, put their mouse, or stay the longest,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Combining this with probability algorithms we run (matching every site element to every site element of over 100,000 websites including an insane amount of artificial data), we are able to know exactly what each and every element of the site is and adjust it so it is accessible adhering to WCAG 2.1 level AA.<span class="im">&#8221; (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">The WCAG guidelines can be perused here</a>.)<br />
</span></p>
<p>Likewise considerations that overlays can interfere with existing accessibility tools, for example if a user has a browser or add-on that automatically captions images or reads out text a certain way; Ekerling said accessiBe defers to user-side tools on these things. And it also works on mobile browsers, which many previous overlays didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the more philosophical question of whether, by having accessibility essentially something you can turn on and off, a site owner is maintaining a sort of &#8220;separate but equal access&#8221; to their content. That&#8217;s a big no-no in this field, like a restaurant having a separate dining room for people with wheelchairs rather than adding a ramp to the front door. Of course since accessiBe doesn&#8217;t make a separate site or permanently modify the source code, it clearly isn&#8217;t that. But it&#8217;s equally clear that the base site isn&#8217;t built to be accessible — it just has a layer of accessibility spread over the top.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s position is that their overlay provides everything needed for ADA compliance and WCAG best practices, and as such constitutes a complete solution for making a website accessible. Others contend that this is not the case and at any rate that developers should not be incentivized to ignore accessibility while building because they think a third party service can provide it with one line of code.</p>

<p>accessiBe is also working on a user-side version that isn&#8217;t reliant on a website including the widget, something that could potentially be very helpful to a lot of people but do little to make the web more accessible in its fundamentals. That takes dedication by many independent actors and businesses. The recently hired Michael Hingson, &#8220;chief visionary officer,&#8221;<a href="https://accessibe.com/blog/news/michael-hingson-joins-accessibe"> acknowledges this</a> while also asserting the usefulness of well-done overlays.</p>
<p>The company has raised $28M in the last year, all from K1 Investment Management. K1 initially invested $12M last may, but more than doubled that commitment after 2020 saw accessiBe tripled their ARR. Much of the cash will be used for further R&amp;D and to consult and hire more people with disabilities for testing, feedback, and development.</p>
<p>Every website should be accessible, that much everyone can agree on. But it&#8217;s a long, complicated, and expensive road to get there. Tools like accessiBe may not be a permanent solution, but they can make a website more accessible tomorrow — and potentially less vulnerable to lawsuits alleging noncompliance with ADA rules — where deeper changes may take months or years to achieve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.levelgoals.com/">Level</a>, a Seattle-based startup that offers credit to gig-economy workers, announced that it has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed round. Level intends to provide various services to gig-economy workers, starting with a lending product.</p>
<p>The goal of Level today is to furnish access to credit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the loan; akin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/lighter-capital-secures-100m-to-grow-its-equity-free-financing-business/">revenue-based financing</a> for startups, workers can borrow a set amount, and pay back a portion of their future earnings until the debt is settled.</p>
<p>Level has larger plans, including offering other services like insurance products to gig workers in the future.</p>
<p>The startup is not big on the &#8220;gig economy&#8221; moniker, instead preferring to say that it&#8217;s helping the smallest companies grow atop various labor marketplaces, summarizing comments that Level CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidxedelstein/">David Edelstein</a> to TechCrunch during an interview concerning the round.</p>
<p>His company has something of a point. Level is not offering loans to Uber drivers, but instead plugged-in with freelance groups like <a href="https://dolly.com/">Dolly</a> (on-demand moving), <a href="https://porch.com/">Porch</a> (home improvement), and <a href="https://www.smarthop.co/">SmartHop</a> (on-demand trucking), services whose users that may depend on non-standard equipment, like trucks and tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NJkiQe7vCY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/">YC-backed Heru raises $1.7M to build software services for Latin American gig workers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Heru raises $1.7M to build software services for Latin American gig workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/embed/#?secret=NJkiQe7vCY" data-secret="NJkiQe7vCY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So if you are doing, say, moving jobs, and want to invest in a new truck, Level may be willing to front you a chunk of capital towards that buy. Edelstein told TechCrunch, lots of folks manage to earn more after putting borrowed funds to work in their small business.</p>
<p>Users of Level&#8217;s loan service can access up to $10,000, though the CEO said that around $2,000 was the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for his company&#8217;s service, as that was an amount of money hard to put on consumer credit cards, but still meaningful to its customer base.</p>
<p>This brings us to repayment. As you&#8217;d expect, if a person did borrow money from Level and managed to generate more revenue afterwards, they might want to retire their debt more quickly than originally anticipated. What&#8217;s notable about the startup&#8217;s model is that if a user repays their loan in less than six weeks, Level will refund half the cost of capital that was originally agreed upon.</p>
<p>Normally repayment of capital takes four months, with the percentage of earnings consumed running between 5% and 15%. So, why would Level be willing to drop half its fee for rapid repayment? Trust, its CEO said. As Level wants to offer more services in the future, it&#8217;s pushing down capital costs for users, hoping that they will help themselves to more services from the company later on.</p>
<p>To that end, Edelstein said, the company&#8217;s usual fee for capital has fallen from 10% to 7%, a rate that his company may push lower over time, perhaps to the break-even point or beyond. Credit, the CEO said, could become a funnel for his company&#8217;s broader product suite.</p>
<p>Certainly with its new capital, raised in late December of 2020 from co-lead investors <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView</a> and <a href="http://untapped.vc/">Untapped</a>, the Seattle-based Level has more time now to maneuver when it comes to product. And with insurance products coming in Q2 to some degree, and more broadly in Q3, we&#8217;re not far from seeing what&#8217;s next for the startup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a>, <a href="https://acumen.org/about/">Acumen</a>, and <a href="https://www.ascend.vc/">Ascend.vc</a> also participated in the round. Per the startup, <a href="http://employmenttechnologyfund.com/about/">the Employment Technology Fund</a> is &#8220;supporting&#8221; the startup&#8217;s credit facility. (Credit facilities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">can get quite large</a>, business depending. If Level scales as it hopes to, expect it to announce more on this front in time.)</p>
<p>Level is a bit like an American <a href="https://somosheru.com/#/home">Heru</a> in that, akin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/">its Latin American fellow-traveler</a>, it wants to offer more and better services, including insurance, to those active at work but not in traditional, full-time roles. If they succeed, expect similar companies to crop up around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://solofunds.com/">SoLo Funds</a> wants to replace payday lenders with a community-based, market-driven model for individual lending and now has $10 million to expand its business in the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Payday lenders offer high interest, short-term loans to borrowers who are at their most vulnerable and the terms of their loans often trap borrowers in a cycle of debt from which there&#8217;s no escape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Around 80% of Americans don&#8217;t have adequate savings to cover unforeseen expenses, and it&#8217;s that statistic that has made payday lending a lucrative business in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past decade websites like GoFundMe and others have cropped up to offer a space where people can donate money to individuals or causes that in some cases serve to supplement the incomes of people most in need. SoLo Funds operates as an alternative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a marketplace where borrowers can set the terms of their loan repayment and lenders can earn extra income while supporting folks who need the help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is financing tens of thousands of loans per month, according to chief executive officer and co-founder, Travis Holoway and loan volumes are growing at about 40% monthly, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Holoway would not disclose the book value of the loans transacted on the platform, he did say that the company&#8217;s default and delinquency rates were lower than that of its competitors. &#8220;Our default rate is about three times better than the industry average &#8212; which is the payday lending industry that we&#8217;re looking to disrupt,&#8221; Holoway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also offers a sort of default insurance product that lenders can purchase to backstop any losses they experience, Holoway said. That service, rolled out in April of last year, helped account for some of the explosive 2,000% growth that the company saw over the course of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SoLo has seen the most activity in Texas, Illinois, California, and New York, states with large populations and cities with the highest cost of living.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our borrowers are school teachers&#8230; are social workers. When you live in those larger cities with higher costs of living they can&#8217;t afford the financial shocks that they could if they lived in Dayton, Ohio,&#8221; said Holoway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the company&#8217;s borrowers represent one cross section of America, the lenders tend to also not be hailing from the demographic that a casual observer might expect, Holoway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">About half of loans on the platform are made by folks that Holoway called power lenders, while the rest are coming from less frequent users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A majority of [power lenders] are college educated and the majority of them tend to be white men. It&#8217;s individuals who you might not think are going to be power lenders&#8230; They may make $100,000 to $125,000 per year,&#8221; said Holoway. &#8220;They&#8217;re looking to diversify their capital and deploy it to make returns. And they&#8217;re able to help individuals out who otherwise would not be able to pay for groceries, paying rent or taking care of their transportation expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the company&#8217;s growth, it&#8217;s no wonder investors like <a href="https://www.acme.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acme.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcamJ4xVbIQd-3uPpJQMEfg7B42A">ACME Capital</a>, with support from <a href="https://www.impactamericafund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.impactamericafund.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiSnrCy6An5yt3WicP8TgT8m9iTA">Impact America Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.techstars.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZkfNviqBdwMYiGzWvXNR_Pm-N6A">Techstars</a>, <a href="https://endeavor.org/approach/catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://endeavor.org/approach/catalyst/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxADpl_6Y3bB-r3y3oy95aCxQyaw">Endeavor Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://www.ceasinvestments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ceasinvestments.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf6DP7yyFKufHZU21xJL-1e5KWOA">CEAS Investments</a> and more joined the new round. previous investors like <a href="https://west.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://west.ventures/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvoevOwz4OM7xmTXWBNr3P5V_G7Q">West Ventures</a>, Taavet Hinrikus of <a href="https://transferwise.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transferwise.com/us&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBji1pj5z47mHm3W_9kElseQyQEg">Transferwise</a>, Jewel Burks Solomon of <a href="https://startup.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://startup.google.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXpcuRtnxufFS7HRLQr503I2yTQQ">Google Startups</a>, Zachary Bookman of <a href="https://opengov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opengov.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWuDRLCxJZG2QnBQe6DYwxlC39Ag">OpenGov,</a> Richelieu Dennis of Essence Ventures, and tech innovation accelerators also participated in financing the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For too long, there have been limited options for individuals in need of immediate <span class="il">funds</span> due to unforeseen circumstances, like a shift in hourly schedules, unplanned car troubles or other cases,” said <span class="il">SoLo</span>, co-founder and CEO Travis Holoway. “<span class="il">SoLo</span> was created to offer safe, affordable options for borrowers that need cash quickly, while also creating a marketplace for lenders to grow capital and help community members in need. We believe that at the end of the day, people are innately honest and tend towards generosity, and our platform’s growth is further proof that people want to do good in the world and make an impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SLAs, SLOs, SLIs. If there&#8217;s one thing everybody in the business of managing software development loves, it&#8217;s acronyms. And while everyone probably knows what a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is, Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) may not be quite as well known. The idea, though, is <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli">straightforward</a>, with SLOs being the overall goals a team must hit to meet the promises of its SLA agreements, and SLIs being the actual measurements that back up those other two numbers. With the advent of DevOps, these ideas, which are typically part of a company&#8217;s overall Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) efforts, are becoming more mainstream, but putting them into practice isn&#8217;t always straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="https://nobl9.com/">Noble9</a> aims to provide enterprises with the tools they need to build SLO-centric operations and the right feedback loops inside an organization to help it hit its SLOs without making too many trade-offs between the cost of engineering, feature development and reliability.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $21 million Series B round led by its Series A investors <a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.battery.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612979686769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYcCpuI14cL90BznsareP3AwF8lQ">Battery Ventures</a> and <a href="https://crv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://crv.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612979686769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgKq6-ljMcFXvbPqOzFYfbZTQo1A">CRV</a>. In addition, Series A investors Bonfire Ventures and Resolute Ventures also participated, together with new investors Harmony Partners and Sorenson Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before starting Nobl9, co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkurc/">Marcin Kurc</a> (CEO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantsinger/">Brian Singer</a> (CPO) spent time together at Orbitera, where Singer was the co-founder and COO and Kurc the CEO, and then at Google Cloud, after it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/google-buys-orbitera-a-platform-for-building-marketplaces-cloud-software/">Orbitera in 2016</a>. In the process, the team got to work with and appreciate Google&#8217;s site reliability engineering frameworks.</p>
<p>As they started looking into what to do next, that experience led them to look into productizing these ideas. &#8220;We came to this conclusion that if you&#8217;re going into Kubernetes, into service-based applications and modern architectures, there&#8217;s really no better way to run that than SRE,&#8221; Kurc told me. &#8220;And when we started looking at this, naturally SRE is a complete framework, there are processes. We started looking at elements of SRE and we agreed that SLO &#8212; service level objectives &#8212; is really the foundational part. You can&#8217;t do SRE without SLOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Singer noted, in order to adopt SLOs, businesses have to know how to turn the data they have about the reliability of their services, which could be measured in uptime or latency, for example, into the right objectives. That&#8217;s complicated by the fact that this data could live in a variety of databases and logs, but the real question is how to define the right SLOs for any given organization based on this data.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you go into the conversation with an organization about what their goals are with respect to reliability and how they start to think about understanding if there&#8217;s risks to that, they very quickly get bogged down in how are we going to get this data or that data and instrument this or instrument that,&#8221; Singer said. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a platform that essentially takes that as the problem that we&#8217;re solving. So no matter where the data lives and in what format it lives, we want to be able to reduce it to very simply an error budget and an objective that can be tracked and measured and reported on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform launched into general availability last week, after a beta that started last year. Early customers include Brex and Adobe.</p>
<p>As Kurc told me, the team actually thinks of this new funding round as a Series A round, but because its $7.5 million Series A was pretty sizable, they decided to call it a Series A instead of a seed round. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to define it. If you define it based on a revenue milestone, we&#8217;re pre-revenue, we just launched the GA product,&#8221; Singer told me. &#8220;But I think just in terms of the maturity of the product and the company, I would put us at the [Series] B.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team told me that it closed the round at the end of last November, and while it considered pitching new VCs, its existing investors were already interested in putting more money into the company and since its previous round had been oversubscribed, they decided to add to this new round some of the investors that didn&#8217;t make the cut for the Series A.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to advance its roadmap and expand its team, especially across sales, marketing and customer success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of optimizing its products for engagement, no matter the costs, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">announced</a> today it will &#8220;test&#8221; changes to its News Feed focused on reducing the distribution of political content. The company qualified these tests will be temporary, impact a small percentage of people, and will only run in select markets, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The point of the experiments, Facebook says, is to explore a variety of ways it can rank political content in the News Feed using different signals, in order to decide on what approach it may take in the future.</p>
<p>It also notes that COVID-19 information from authoritative health organizations like the CDC and WHO, as well as national and regional health agencies and services, will be exempt from being downranked in the News Feed during these tests. Similarly, content from official government agencies will not be impacted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tests may also include a survey component, where Facebook asks impacted users about their experience.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s announcement of the tests is meant to sound underwhelming because any large-scale changes would be an admission of guilt, of sorts. Facebook has the capacity to make far greater changes &#8212; when it wanted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/28/how-publishers-will-survive-facebooks-newsfeed-change/">downrank publisher content</a>, it did so, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43225987">decimating</a> a number of media businesses along the way. In previous years, it also took harder action against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/facebook-fights-foot-fungus-ads/">low-quality sites</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/facebook-demotes-scrapers/">scrapers</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/facebook-anti-clickbait/">clickbait</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/30/facebook-spammers/">spam</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The news of Facebook&#8217;s tests comes at a time when people are questioning social media&#8217;s influence and direction. A growing number of social media users now believe tech platforms have been playing a role in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/isolation-and-social-media-combine-to-radicalize-violent-offenders-11565041473">radicalizing</a> <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/social-media-has-been-radicalizing-people-for-years/">people</a>, as their algorithms promote unbalanced views of the world, isolate people into social media bubbles, and allow dangerous speech and misinformation to go viral.</p>
<p>In a poll this week, <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-radicalizes-people-poll-02fcaaf0-28ee-4242-bd5b-d6a591203e21.html">reported by Axios</a>, a majority of Americans said they now believe social media radicalizes, with 74% also saying misinformation is an an extremely or very serious problem. Another 76% believe social media was at least partially responsible for the Capitol riot, which 7 in 10 think is the result of unchecked extreme behavior online, the report noted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a third of Americans<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/study-finds-around-one-third-of-americans-regularly-get-their-news-from-facebook/"> regularly get their news from Facebook</a>, according to a study from Pew Research Center, which means they&#8217;re often now reading more extreme viewpoints from fringe publishers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/"> a related Pew study had found</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, Facebook has been accused of exacerbating political unrest, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/indonesia-restricts-whatsapp-and-instagram/">deadly riots in Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">genocide</a> in Myanmar, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-brazil/facebook-puts-global-block-on-brazils-bolsonaro-supporters-idUKKBN24X3XO?edition-redirect=uk">spread of misinformation</a> in Brazil during elections, and more.</p>
<p>Facebook, however, today argues that political content is a small amount of the News Feed (e.g. 6% of what people in the U.S. see) &#8212; an attempt to deflect any blame for the state of the world, while positioning the downranking change as just something user feedback demands that Facebook explore.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Managing IoT devices in a large organization can be a messy proposition, especially when many of them aren&#8217;t even managed directly by IT and often involve integrating with a number of third-party systems. <a href="https://securithings.com/">SecuriThings</a> wants to help with a platform of services to bring that all under control, and today the startup announced a $14 million Series A.</p>
<p>Aleph led the round with participation from existing investor Firstime VC and a number of unnamed angels. The company has raised a total of $17 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Roy Dagan, company CEO and co-founder says that he sees organizations with many different connected devices running on a network and it&#8217;s difficult to manage. &#8220;We enable organizations to manage IoT devices securely at scale in a consolidated and cost efficient manner,&#8221; Dagan told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could include devices like security cameras along with access control systems and building management systems involving thousands &#8212; or in some instances, tens of thousands &#8212; of devices.&#8221;The technology we build, we integrate with management systems, and then we deploy our capabilities which are focused on the edge devices. So that&#8217;s how we also find the devices, and then we have these different capabilities running on the edge devices or fetching information from the edge devices,&#8221; Dagan explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111427" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111427" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?w=680" alt="SecuriThings Horizon - Screenshot - Device view" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg 3072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SecuriThings-Horizon-Screenshot-2-Device-view.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SecuriThings</p></div></p>
<p>The company has formed partnerships with a number of key device manufacturers including Microsoft, Convergint Technologies and Johnson Controls, among others. They work with a range of industries including airports, casinos and large corporate campuses.</p>
<p>Aaron Rosenson, general partner at lead investor Aleph, says the company is solving a big problem managing the myriad devices inside large organizations. &#8220;Until SecuriThings came along, there were these massive enterprise software categories of automation, orchestration and observability just waiting to be built for IoT,&#8221; Rosenson said in a statement. He says that SecuiThings is pulling that all together for its customers.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2016 originally with the idea of being an IoT security company, and while they still are involved in securing these devices, their ability to communicate with them gives IT much greater visibility and insight and the ability to update and manage them.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 30 employees, and with the new investment it will be doubling that number by the end of the year. While Dagan didn&#8217;t cite specific customer numbers, he did say they have dozens of customers with deal sizes of between five and seven figures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fiverr.com">Fiverr</a> is adding a new way for freelancers on the marketplace to charge for their work — three- or six-month <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/pages/subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>Through this feature, sellers on Fiverr can offer to provide a defined set of work each month. They can also offer discounts to subscribers, although it&#8217;s not required. The buyer or seller can cancel at any time, with no fees paid on the remaining months of the subscription — but the savings only start in the second month, to prevent situations where buyers might try to use subscriptions just to get a one-time discount.</p>
<p>Product Manager Natasha Shine-Zirkel told me that that while Fiverr built its reputation as a marketplace to hire freelancers on a &#8220;one-time or per-project basis,&#8221; it&#8217;s increasingly become a home for ongoing work as well. So the company decided to make it easier to provide and pay for that work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She said businesses who sign up for a subscription will get access to &#8220;high-quality sellers and build long-term relationships,&#8221; and it also &#8220;saves them hassle of filling out their requirements each time.&#8221; Sellers, meanwhile, will get more predictability in their workload and revenue.</p>

<p>Fiverr Subscriptions are being made available to what the company said are the &#8220;top freelancers&#8221; in eight categories, including social media marketing, SEO and voice overs.</p>
<p>Shine-Zirkel said Fiverr is starting out small to &#8220;learn from sellers who are really high quality and already have existing relationships.&#8221; She added that the initial categories represent a mix of work that&#8217;s normally retainer-based and other jobs that are more project-based, allowing the company to observe &#8220;how buyers and sellers use the feature&#8221; in different contexts.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shine-Zirkel described this as &#8220;just the beginning,&#8221; with Fiverr rolling the feature out to more freelancers in more categories over time.</p>
<p>In addition to launching support for subscriptions, Fiverr is introducing another feature around longer-term work called Milestones, where a bigger job is broken down into smaller pieces, with the buyer paying for each milestone as it&#8217;s completed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://powder.gg">Powder</a>, a French startup that helps you share video clips of your favorite games, follow people with the same interests and interact with them. The company has raised a $14 million Series A round led by Serena.</p>
<p>Powder wants to build the video infrastructure for social gaming. While many communities of gamers already share content on Twitch, Discord and Reddit, there isn’t a dominant mobile app focused on gaming.</p>
<p>You could call it an Instagram or Snapchat for gamers, but the startup has built specific tools that make it similar and yet different from those mainstream social platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Powder can capture video content from any platform. You can record with your console and access your footage by connecting your account with Powder. You can capture videos on your PC using the company’s desktop app. You can also capture videos of mobile games.</p>
<p>The company tries to identify the most relevant events in your favorite game — it can be when you score a goal on Rocket League, when you are the last person standing in Fortnite, etc.</p>
<p>You can then trim your video, add filters, music and stickers and share a video with your followers. Other users can share reactions, add comments and send messages.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111438" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111438" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2111438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111438" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Powder</p></div></p>
<p>Overall, the company has raised $18 million and is pretty transparent about its funding story. In August 2018, the company raised a $400,000 pre-seed round with Kima Ventures and the co-founders of Zenly Antoine Martin and Alexis Bonillo. In March 2019, General Catalyst, Slow Ventures, Dream Machine, SV Angel, Brian Pokorny, Florian Kahn and Guillaume Luccisano invested $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Around May 2020, the company had to raise a $1.3 million seed extension with Alven Capital, Seraam Invest, Farmers, Maxime Demeure, Jean-Nicolas Vernin and some existing investors. Bpifrance and CNC also put some money in the company. And now, Serena is leading the $14 million Series A round with General Catalyst, Slow Ventures, Alven Capital, Bpifrance’s Digital Venture fund, Secocha Ventures, Turner Novak and Kevin Hartz also participating in today’s round.</p>
<p>As you can see, it’s been a long and winding road. That’s because Powder didn’t come up with its social app for gamers overnight. The company tried many different consumer apps. It would iterate on an idea for a few weeks and then kill the concept if it didn’t pan out. With Powder, the company seems to have found a great distribution mechanism to attract more downloads, leading to more users.</p>
<p>“The idea behind Powder started in December 2019. We had already worked on several projects and none of them really took off. We thought we would create a community first and then a product,” co-founder and CEO Stanislas Coppin told me. He previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mindie/">Mindie</a>, a music video app.</p>
<p>Powder started as a Discord server with tens of thousands of members. The team then developed an app that would appeal to that community, the “metaverse camera” as Coppin says. Overall, 1.5 million people have downloaded the iOS app since its launch.</p>
<p>There are three other co-founders, Barthélémy Kiss, Yannis Mangematin and Christian Navelot. There are 18 employees and the company just launched on Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity startup CYE has raised $100 million in a new growth round, led by investment firm EQT and with participation from 83North.</p>
<p>CYE was founded in 2012 by Reuven Aronashvili to help companies shore up their security posture. It does this in large part by conducting offensive operations against their customers — with their explicit consent — to find weaknesses in their network defenses before malicious hackers do. The company also provides incident response and security consultants, as well as its flagship product, Hyver, which helps companies assess their entire network and assets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that&#8217;s working: CYE says it has been profitable since it was founded, and has customers in the Fortune 500. The company has presence in London, and recently opened a New York office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CYE&#8217;s chief marketing officer Sharon Argov told TechCrunch that the company will use the $100 million investment to expand its operations, invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and plans to double its 80-person workforce.</p>
<p>Aronashvili said in remarks that the company is &#8220;laser-focused on building a company that fundamentally changes the way organizations approach cybersecurity, enabling them to accurately assess the most urgent threats to their business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> noticed last week that we had a bevy of software-as-a-service (SaaS) stories that we wanted to chat about. So we decided to break them out into their own episode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What came out of the conversation is a mix of optimism, sarcasm, and healthy doubt regarding what&#8217;s next for SaaS. SaaS matters as it is an incredibly popular business model for startups, a way to generate high-margin recurring incomes. Indeed, it&#8217;s almost the default method for revenue generation amongst startups today.</p>
<p>But precisely what SaaS is, and how it works, appear to be moving targets.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/">piece</a> by our own Danny Crichton, for example, digs into a trend that he has noticed in the broader software space, namely startups taking a single task, or feature, and providing it in a manner that ascribes to best practices. For example, online checkout tech has been around since the dawn of the Internet. And yet Rapyd and Fast and Checkout.com and others are raising oceans of capital to provide checkout solutions to other companies. Why? They offer best practices-like services.</p>
<p>From there we talked about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/the-future-of-saas-is-on-demand-use-experts-to-drive-growth-and-engagement/">inclusion of humans into software</a>, which isn&#8217;t a radical concept but has new weight considering the information overload world we live in. The whole concept of having an Airtable hotline to answer each and every random question we have seems like music to our ears, what about yours?</p>
<p>And finally we discussed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">growing use</a> of on-demand pricing over traditional SaaS. Danny asked if this is really something new, which we discussed. Perhaps we&#8217;re seeing <em>more</em> on-demand pricing in modern software companies thanks to not only the success of companies like Snowflake, but also growing ranks of API-delivered startups.</p>
<p>Overall it was fun to niche down to a single theme, something we rarely get to do on the main show. Expect more of this from us in the following months!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Between a pandemic, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/startup-cynicism/">emergence of new media business models</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">upcoming privacy changes in iOS</a>, this might seem like a terrible time to get into digital advertising and marketing. Nevertheless, we spoke to top venture capitalists who said they still see investment opportunities.</p>
<p>When we surveyed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/5-vcs-agree-the-pandemic-has-reshaped-adtech-and-martech/">adtech and martech VCs last summer</a>, we focused on the impact of COVID-19. This time, we asked them to update us on whether deal flow has recovered (MathCapital&#8217;s Eric Franchi said the last two quarters have been some of the firm&#8217;s most active yet) and to look ahead at the possibility of additional regulation and the most promising new tools.</p>
<p>Regulation, they agreed, presents both a risk and an opportunity. For example, Christine Tsai of 500 Startups noted that as advertisers face more restrictions, &#8220;The easiest way for marketers to comply with these rules will likely be through software.&#8221; And of course, we asked about what they&#8217;re looking for in their next investment. You can read their full responses below.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who we surveyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Franchi, partner, <a href="https://www.mathcapital.ventures">MathCapital</a></li>
<li>Scott Friend, partner, <a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com">Bain Capital Ventues</a></li>
<li>Christine Tsai, CEO and founding partner, <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Digital advertising spend seems well on its way to recovering from the initial downturn during the pandemic. Are you seeing the same with adtech and martech deal flow?</h2>
<p><strong>Eric Franchi:</strong> Absolutely. Q3 and Q4 2020 were amongst the most active we&#8217;ve had in three years in terms of new investments and follow-ons. This seems to mirror the shape of many of our portfolio companies&#8217; 2020 commercial results.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Friend:</strong> There seems to be plenty of activity in adtech and martech, particularly across the commerce ecosystem with tools that support monetization for small merchants. Attentive (one of ours) continues to be a standout. I’m also seeing what appears to be a resurgence in digital OOH activity … maybe now’s its time?</p>
<h2>How much time are you spending looking at adtech and martech startups right now? Are you more focused on one or the other?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you are a founder and launched a startup last February of 2020 just before the pandemic hit, then you may have felt like you were living the ultimate business nightmare. But if your company serves to stabilize the supply-chain business, then, in fact, you may have hit the ground running at just the right time. So is the story of Miami-based startup <a href="https://www.smarthop.co/">SmartHop</a>, an AI-powered app that helps interstate truckers make their routes more efficient and lucrative, while removing a lot of the administrative hassle for drivers.</p>
<p>SmartHop announced today that it raised $12 million in a Series A round, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to date to $16.5 million. The round was led by Union Square Ventures, whose past investments include Stripe, Twitter, Coinbase, Etsy, MeetUp, SkillShare and Duolingo, among others.</p>
<p>SmartHop takes a complex problem with lots of moving parts and offers a simple solution. To understand the gap in the market, you need to understand the hurdles that interstate truck drivers face. And since Garcia is a former truck driver himself (he was a pet food delivery driver while in college in his native Venezuela and scaled his business to a 500-person trucking company), he has a good grasp on the pain points and intricacies of the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I lived with my parents in Caracas and I asked my parents to empty their garage and that was my first distribution center,” said Guillermo Garcia, CEO and co-founder of SmartHop, of his experience starting his first trucking company. “The trucking market moves like the stock market,” he added, explaining that it’s ever-changing and therefore impossible to predict.</p>
<p>According to a 2019 study by <a href="https://www.trucking.org/news-insights">The American Trucking Associations</a>, the trucking industry is a $791.7 billion industry, representing 80.4% of the nation’s freight bill. Additionally, 91% of trucking companies are small businesses, meaning they have six trucks or fewer. Many are owner-operators. Traditionally, to get loads, truckers had to scour apps or websites of about 15,000 different brokers. It was a total uncoordinated, inefficient, free-for-all approach that left drivers unable to predict their monthly revenues, among many other things.</p>
<p>This is how SmartHop helps those drivers. Let’s say Bob lives in Atlanta and he has a single truck; he&#8217;s an owner-operator. He has a load that’s going to take him all the way to Seattle, and it’s going to take him several days to get there. Financially, it doesn’t make a lot of sense for Bob to start the trip without knowing what else he can pick up along the way, or if Seattle should really be his turnaround point. Maybe there’s not a lot of freight leaving Seattle these days, but there’s a lot going out of Chicago. There’s no way for Bob to know these things.</p>
<p>Before SmartHop, Bob had to pick up the phone, call brokers and make deals. Most of this work was done while on the road and Bob had no foresight into his next couple of weeks of work &#8211; or life, for that matter.</p>
<p>With SmartHop, Bob can enter details about his truck’s capacity, cities he doesn’t like driving through and other details, and SmartHop will recommend loads to him that optimize his profits and travel time. Think of it like when you’re driving and using Waze and it asks if you want to drive to Starbucks because it’s a couple of minutes out of the way. All you have to do is accept, and Waze does the rest. SmartHop operates similarly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111335" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111335" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png 1446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SmartHop-Loads.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111335" class="wp-caption-text">SmartHop technology giving a driver three load booking options, which the platform’s tech will negotiate and book (image: SmartHop).</p></div></p>
<p>“Some truckers don’t like to drive through New York City because there are a lot of tolls, bridges and traffic,” said Garcia, “So it doesn’t matter the value of the load, he’s just not going to pick it up,” he added.</p>
<p>But if you really want to go full autopilot, SmartHop can take over and autonomously book the loads for you &#8211; all you have to do is drive and take care of the truck, Garcia said.</p>
<p>The more a trucker uses SmartHop, the more the company learns the driver’s preferences and makes better suggestions or bookings.</p>
<p>SmartHop charges a transaction fee of 3% of the gross sale. “Our incentives are very aligned, so when they make money, we make money, and when they are taking days off, we don’t charge anything,” said Garcia.</p>
<p>“[Union Square Ventures] is focused on businesses that utilize technology to build networks and broaden access,” said Rebecca Kaden, managing partner at Union Square Ventures. &#8220;We were particularly excited to meet Guillermo and the SmartHop team, because that&#8217;s exactly what they are doing &#8212; software empowers the owner-operator trucking company to optimize their business and compete with players far bigger in number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryder, the Miami-based logistics company, also participated in the round through its new venture arm, RyderVenture. SmartHop is its first investment. Equal Ventures and Greycroft, from SmartHop&#8217;s seed round, also invested.</p>
<p>“A lot of startups have a lot of good technology and no one to test it on,” said Karen Jones, Ryder executive VP, CMO and head of new product innovation. &#8220;And the software doesn’t go very far if there is no one in the real world to try it.&#8221; Prior to the RyderVenture investment, Ryder partnered with SmartHop to test the product on its own trucks, of which they have 275,000.</p>
<p>The company, which was part of the 2019 New York City Techstars cohort, currently has 50 full-time employees and 100 trucks using the product. Each truck, on average, grosses between $10K &#8211; $15K per month.</p>
<p>The latest funding round will go toward product development as well as embedded financial products. Unlike big companies, smaller trucking companies don’t have the leverage to negotiate better rates on fuel or insurance, but with SmartHop’s volume of drivers, it can change that. Additionally, they’ll be offering to factor invoices, so drivers can sell a 45-day invoice and get paid within just 24 hours by SmartHop. “Because we have so much data, we become the ultimate underwriter so I’m able to underwrite in advance, and much smarter,” said Garcia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, a startup that competes in the corporate spend market, announced that it has secured a $150 million debt facility with Goldman Sachs. Ramp previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">raised a $30 million Series B</a> in late December 2020, after raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">a $23 million Series A</a> earlier in the same year.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Ramp co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman?lang=en">Eric Glyman</a> about its new credit access. Glyman said that until it was secured, his company had previously financed customer corporate spend off its own balance sheet. That effort would have become more difficult and inefficient as Ramp secured more customers, something that its rapid-fire fundraising implies that it has.</p>
<p>Its larger startup category is growing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/">as TechCrunch has reported</a>. Ramp, <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a>, <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a> and others compete for the custom of companies&#8217; spend; the startups provide credit to businesses usually on a charge-card basis, collecting interchange revenues and, in some cases, software incomes as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ramp intends on using its new credit facility to boost its product work, Glyman said, noting that its new access to revolving debt will free up capital that it can invest into software.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JJ4h0cKqJG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/">As corporate cards are subsumed into software, Airbase posts rapid growth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As corporate cards are subsumed into software, Airbase posts rapid growth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/embed/#?secret=JJ4h0cKqJG" data-secret="JJ4h0cKqJG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So far Ramp&#8217;s model appears to be working. The company told TechCrunch that it saw 47% growth from November to December, a figure that measures not revenue but transaction volume. However, as Ramp monetizes off of transaction volume, we can infer that its revenue scaled rapidly during the same period.</p>
<p>The tingling feeling you have on the back of your neck is correct; Ramp is now big enough to share harder numbers than mere percentage growth metrics. We do know that the company reached the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">$100 million spend threshold</a> &#8212; an aggregate metric, not a rate &#8212; in the fall of 2020 after being founded around 18 months earlier. From there you can math your way to an estimate of the company&#8217;s current spend base.</p>
<p>Ramp is betting its software package, wrapped around corporate cards, on a focus on savings; the startup helps customers root out repeat payments and other mal expense.</p>
<p>It has competition. Ramp&#8217;s rivals are also layering software on top of corporate card offerings. A question that TechCrunch has raised is whether all players in the maturing corporate spend space will wind up charging for their software layer on top of their credit offerings (TeamPay, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">reported both software revenues <em>and</em> transaction volume results</a> to TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>Corporate spend TAM would rise if so.</p>
<p>To grok what&#8217;s going on in the corporate spend management space, recall the changes in the world of venture capital over the last decade or so. In olden times, venture firms had money to invest in startups. There wasn&#8217;t much by current standards, and it was concentrated in only a few hands. It was rare. So, venture capitalists were able to make you come to them, charge more equity per dollar of investment and not offer modern-level services. Today, however, in venture-land money is plentiful, so investing terms are more generous. And, on top of merely offering access to capital, your local VC probably wants to help startups hire, and more.</p>
<p>Corporate spend is the same. Offering credit and corporate cards is now barely table stakes; the value of the software on <em>top</em> of the revolving charge card is the competition.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how fast Ramp can grow its customer base, spend and revenue, while scaling its software. And how soon one of its rivals tries to one-up its latest with news of its own. This is a fun space to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.neureality.ai/">NeuReality</a>, an Israeli AI hardware startup that is working on a novel approach to improving AI inferencing platforms by doing away with the current CPU-centric model, is coming out of stealth today and announcing an $8 million seed round. The group of investors includes Cardumen Capital, crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and Varana Capital. The company also today announced that Naveen Rao, the GM of Intel’s AI Products Group and former CEO of Nervana System (which Intel acquired), is joining the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>The founding team, CEO Moshe Tanach, VP of operations Tzvika Shmueli and VP for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration#:~:text=Very%20large%2Dscale%20integration%20(VLSI,telecommunication%20technologies%20to%20be%20developed.">very large-scale integration</a> Yossi Kasus, has a background in AI but also networking, with Tanach spending time at Marvell and Intel, for example, Shmueli at Mellanox and Habana Labs and Kasus at Mellanox, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s networking and storage knowledge and seeing how that industry built its hardware that now informs how NeuReality is thinking about building its own AI platform. In an interview ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Tanach wasn&#8217;t quite ready to delve into the details of NeuReality&#8217;s architecture, but the general idea here is to build a platform that will allow hyperscale clouds and other data center owners to offload their ML models to a far more performant architecture where the CPU doesn&#8217;t become a bottleneck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We kind of combined a lot of techniques that we brought from the storage and networking world,&#8221; Tanach explained. Think about traffic manager and what it does for Ethernet packets. And we applied it to AI. So we created a bottom-up approach that is built around the engine that you need. Where today, they&#8217;re using neural net processors &#8212; we have the next evolution of AI computer engines.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tanach noted, the result of this should be a system that &#8212; in real-world use cases that include not just synthetic benchmarks of the accelerator but also the rest of the overall architecture &#8212; offer 15 times the performance per dollar for basic deep learning offloading and far more once you offload the entire pipeline to its platform.</p>
<p>NeuReality is still in its early days, and while the team has working prototypes now, based on a Xilinx FPGA, it expects to be able to offer its fully custom hardware solution early next year. As its customers, NeuReality is targeting the large cloud providers, but also data center and software solutions providers like WWT to help them provide specific vertical solutions for problems like fraud detection, as well as OEMs and ODMs.</p>
<p>Tanach tells me that the team&#8217;s work with Xilinx created the groundwork for its custom chip &#8212; though building that (and likely on an advanced node), will cost money, so he&#8217;s already thinking about raising the next round of funding for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already consuming huge amounts of AI in our day-to-day life and it will continue to grow exponentially over the next five years,&#8221; said Tanach. &#8220;In order to make AI accessible to every organization, we must build affordable infrastructure that will allow innovators to deploy AI-based applications that cure diseases, improve public safety and enhance education. NeuReality&#8217;s technology will support that growth while making the world smarter, cleaner and safer for everyone. The cost of the AI infrastructure and AIaaS will no longer be limiting factors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/">Insight</a> is bringing web browser extensions to the iPhone, with the goal of delivering a better web browsing experience by blocking ads and trackers, flagging fake reviews on Amazon, offering SEO-free search experiences, or even calling out media bias and misinformation, among other things.</p>
<p>These features are made available by way of Insight&#8217;s extensions, some of which are suggested during the app&#8217;s first launch. Others, meanwhile, can be browsed inside the app, where they&#8217;re organized into categories like Search, Shopping, Cooking &amp; Dining, News, Health, and Reading. The browser can also make suggestions of extensions to try, based on your browsing behavior, if you opt into that experience.</p>
<p>One extension, for example, can block ads on Google, Amazon and in your social media feeds, like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. Another works with <a href="https://reviewmeta.com/">ReviewMeta</a> to detect fake reviews on Amazon.com and lets you set price alerts with help from <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel&#8217;s</a> price tracker. Others let you do things like enable dark mode experiences on sites that don&#8217;t offer the feature, check for bias in news via <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/">Media Bias Fact Check</a>, or watch videos in picture-in-picture mode on YouTube and other video sites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2110843" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110843" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110843" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png 3544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/leftright.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Insight</p></div></p>
<p>In total, the company has around one hundred extensions already created, but it offers tools that allow anyone &#8212; even non-developers &#8212; to create their own, too.</p>
<p>Using a simple interface similar to something like the iOS Shortcuts app, users can define the conditions for their extension using basic &#8220;if, then&#8221; logic. For example, &#8220;if I&#8217;m is on a page that matches this URL&#8221; or &#8220;is on this list of domains,&#8221; &#8220;then also show this other page.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make these sorts of features work on mobile took some creativity. Apple restricts what developers are able to do with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview">WKWebView</a> &#8212; which means a mobile browser can&#8217;t offer the same sort of extensions as you can find on the desktop web.</p>
<p>To work around this problem, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1531407280?mt=8">Insight</a> created a sort of &#8220;sub-tab&#8221; workflow where you navigate using swiping gestures. For example, when online shopping, you could view the product you&#8217;re interested in, then swipe over to see the available coupons, the trusted product reviews, or to comparison shop across other sites.</p>
<p>When looking for a recipe, you could limit searches to only a list of your favorite food blogs. And because you can use extensions together, you could also block the ads on the food blogs and then swipe over to view the site in a &#8220;reader mode.&#8221;</p>

<p>How this all works is up to you. It&#8217;s dependent on what extensions you have installed and enabled, and how they&#8217;re configured.</p>
<p>The idea for Insight actually arose from an earlier effort from a startup focused on building a custom search engine for doctors. The team had participated in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2019 session, where they developed a search engine that would filter out the junk medical content and other pages aimed at consumers from the web, in order to direct doctors to sources they could trust.</p>
<p>But things changed when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the users we had been working with, up to that point, were medical students. And when the pandemic came to the U.S., medical students and medical schools were shut down and a lot of the students were sent home,&#8221; explains Insight co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/archajain/">Archa Jain</a>. &#8220;Our user base disappeared overnight,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The team decided to refocus their efforts on another idea they had been tossing around internally for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that the problem we were solving isn&#8217;t medicine-specific. The fundamental problem was that the internet is just not one-size-fits-all. So we thought, what if everyone could have this lability to customize their browser experience the way we&#8217;re doing for this one population? They could really mould their browser their own needs,&#8221; Jain said.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how Insight came to life.</p>
<p>Insight was built by a small team, including Jain, whose engineering background includes time at Google, Uber and Calico, and fellow co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmaabhinav/">Abhinav Sharma</a>, previously of Quora, Mozilla Labs, and Facebook, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhi-nigam/">Shubhi Nigam</a>, previously a PM at Newgen Software.</p>
<p>The company is backed by a seed round of $1.5 million from Y Combinator, Heartcore Capital and Altair Capital.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Insight intends to layer on a pro version of the service on top of the existing offering available today. It also aims to bring the browser to the desktop, where it will work as an extension itself.</p>
<p>Since launching into beta testing in December 2020, the app&#8217;s top 10% most active users have been averaging over 1,000 pageviews on Insight per day, which indicates some loyal customers have perhaps shifted to using the app as their preferred mobile browser. Pre-launch, the app had also become the No. 1 most popular download for a time on <a href="https://app.airport.community/">Airport</a>, an app store for beta products.</p>
<p>Insight is available today as a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1531407280?mt=8">free download on the App Store.</a></p>
