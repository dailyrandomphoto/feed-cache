										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six months after raising $75 million, </span><a href="https://www.pacaso.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a real estate platform which aims to help people buy and co-own a second home &#8212; announced today that it has raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the Series C funding round for Pacaso, which essentially went from “launch to unicorn” in five months earlier this year and is pronounced like Picasso. New backers Fifth Wall and Gaingels also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Greycroft, Global Founders Capital, Crosscut and 75 &amp; Sunny Ventures. (Sunny Ventures is Pacaso co-founder Spencer Rascoff’s venture firm). With the latest round, Picasso has now raised a total of $215 million in equity funding since its 2020 inception. It also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured $1 billion in debt financing earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fully distributed startup launched its platform in October of last year and already has an annualized revenue run rate of $330 million, according to CEO and co-founder Austin Allison &#8212; a feat which quite frankly seems remarkable. The company currently manages nearly $200 million in real estate on its platform, and in the second quarter, its website and mobile app saw a combined 1.8 million visits, up 196% from the first quarter. It’s currently serving owners “in the hundreds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Zillow executives Allison and Rascoff came up with the concept of Pacaso after leaving Zillow together about two years ago. (Publicly traded Zillow today has a market cap of $24 billion.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a unique co-ownership model made possible via the creation of a property-specific LLC, the company aims to reduce the cost and hassle of second home ownership. It also gives vacation homeowners an alternative option to renting out their property.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=1AQ1btPGx8" data-secret="1AQ1btPGx8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso distinguishes its model from the age-old concept of timeshares, which sell the right to use a fixed amount of time in a condo or hotel. Pacaso aims to bring together a small group of co-owners to purchase a share of a single-family home and “enjoy ongoing access throughout the year.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is that Pacaso purchases a home either outright or shares in a home. The company then partners with local real estate agents to market the properties. It then sells shares in the home — from one-eighth of the home to a greater percentage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso holds a brokerage license in about 25 top second home markets such as Napa, Lake Tahoe, Palm Springs, Malibu and Park City. It recently expanded to its first market outside of the U.S. &#8212; Spain. Buyers can view curated listings on the startup’s website, which includes active listings, as well as previews of homes under consideration for purchase based on buyer demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to curating the listings, Pacaso also offers integrated financing, “upscale” interior design, professional property management and proprietary scheduling technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January of this year, Pacaso had 30 employees. Today, it has over 120, according to Allison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that while Pacaso one day aspires to offer homes that are affordable to a broader segment of the population, Allison acknowledges that currently, the homes available on its platform are “very much” luxury, or higher price, homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for what markets it plans to enter next, he said that will be based on customer feedback. For now, Allison said, 65% of Pacaso’s customers are first-time second homeowners </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 25% of are non-white or identify as LGBTQ.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Investing Partner </span><a href="https://visionfund.com/team/lydia-jett"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Jett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says she was drawn to Pacaso for both professional and personal reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one thing, she says that when she was growing up, her family owned one-tenth of a “modest” beach house on the coast of Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is asset that should be an investment, and source of joy actually had an incredible amount of friction, pain and unexpected cost,” Jett told TechCrunch. “It was a difficult asset to make liquid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The friction and pain she referred to included debates around scheduling, capital investments and tension when one of the co-owners needed liquidity but none of the others wanted to buy them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the pain involved many of the the things that Pacaso is trying to solve for, Jett believes. By managing the whole co-ownership process, owners don’t have to deal with the “headaches” of maintenance, furnishings and scheduling respective vacations, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve designed  a very innovative scheduling solution we call SmartStay, which empowers a calendar to be shared equitably among the ownership group so that each co-owner has fair and equitable access to the property all times of the year,” Allison told TechCrunch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Picasso is effectively an intermediary between the co-owners, something Jett makes it a very attractive model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, she said, SoftBank was drawn to the opportunity to “create a whole new category of home ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is something that fundamentally can enrich millions of people’s lives,” she told TechCrunch, “and help them realize that dream of co-ownership.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sellersfunding.com/">SellersFunding</a> secured $166.5 million in a combination of Series A equity funding and a credit facility to continue developing its technology and payments platforms for e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p>Northzone led the round and was joined by Endeavor Catalyst and Fasanara. SellersFunding CEO Ricardo Pero did not disclose the funding breakdown, but did say the company previously raised two seed rounds for a total of $40 million in equity and more than $100 million in credit facilities, including one that the company was expanding to $200 million.</p>
<p>SellersFunding, with offices in Florida, New York and London, created a digital platform that delivers financial tools and resources to streamline global commerce for thousands of marketplaces, including working capital, cross-border cash management, tax solutions and business valuation.</p>
<p>Pero got the idea for the company after spending 20 years in the financial industry. He left JP Morgan in 2016 with a drive to start his own company. He was consulting for a friend selling on Amazon who asked him to help make sense of Amazon’s fees and to review the next year’s budget because the friend was struggling to keep up with growth.</p>
<p>“I helped him address the fees issue, but when I went to talk to traditional lenders, I found that they have no clue about e-commerce and the needs of SMEs,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to being a lending source for businesses selling on these marketplaces, SellersFunding leverages sales data provided by the marketplaces and e-commerce platforms to create sales and cash flow estimates based on the credit limits given to clients so that owners can better understand the fees they are paying and make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>He founded the company in 2017, and today has over 30,000 registered users and is approaching $10 billion in sales volume that is feeding data into SellersFunding’s daily models. The company makes money as both a lender and on fees it charges for payments collected by its customers. Merchants can collect money from marketplaces and pay their suppliers in local or foreign currency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SellersFunding has consistently grown 300% year over year, Pero said. As such, he intends to use the new funding to scale globally, expand the team, create a marketing budget and look for two small acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The company will continue to invest on the payments side and to promote cross-border payments.</p>
<p>“When I look at the payments landscape, companies are competing on pricing and I don’t think we will ever have a focus there, but instead will compete on customer experience,” Pero added. “Our core business will always be lending and our core investments will be payments and technology, but then we will extend to other services that our clients want.”</p>
<p>With an eye on expanding internationally, it fit to bring on Northzone as a partner, he added. The venture firm is based in Europe and was of a similar vision for thinking globally.</p>
<p>Jeppe Zink, general partner at Northzone, said via email that Pero and his team “are the most experienced in this category” and are building a category leader that is “more experienced and understanding of the lending side than its competitors.”</p>
<p>“We have seen this massive rise in e-shopping, most of the new ones coming from marketplaces like Amazon and Shopify, and if you look at the sellers, thousands are small businesses sourcing their goods which means that they are very important customers,” Zink added. “Normal banks like Barclay can&#8217;t check credit. SellersFinding is helping small businesses get this credit, and rightly so. In the same way we thought neobanks won with accounts created when it comes to delivering credit and banking products, they are nowhere to be found yet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Corporate gift services have come into their own during the Covid-19 pandemic by standing in as a proxy for other kinds of relationship building activities &#8212; office meetings, lunches, and hosting at events &#8212; that have traditionally been part and parcel of how people do business, but were no longer feasible during lockdowns, social distancing and offices closing their doors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, <a href="https://sendoso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendoso</a> &#8212; a popular &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; gifting platform offering access to 30,000 products including corporate swag, regular physical gifts, gift cards and more; and then providing services like logistics, packing and sending to get those gifts to the recipients &#8212; is announcing $100 million of funding to capitalize on this shift, led by a big new investor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New backer SoftBank, via its Vision Fund 2, is leading this latest Series C round of funding. Oak HC/FT, Struck Capital, Stage 2 Capital, Craft Ventures, Signia Venture Partners and Felicis Ventures &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/for-a-monthly-subscription-fee-this-startup-will-send-out-customized-gifts-to-current-and-prospective-clients-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/online-to-offline-platform-sendoso-raises-40m-after-growing-330-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors</a> &#8212; are also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company has been on a strong growth trajectory for years now, but it specifically saw a surge of activity as the pandemic kicked off. It now has more than 20,000 businesses signed up and using its services, particularly for sales and marketing outreach, but also to help shore up morale among employees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Everyone was stuck at home by themselves, saturated with emails,&#8221; said Kris Rudeegraap, the CEO of Sendoso, in an interview. &#8220;Having a personal connection to sales prospects, employees and others just meant more.&#8221; It has now racked up some 3 million gifts sent since launching in 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sendoso is not disclosing its valuation, but Rudeegraap hinted that it was four times higher than the startup&#8217;s Series B valuation from 2020. PitchBook <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/171316-63/company/profile#comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that to be $160 million, which would make the current valuation $640 million. The company has now raised over $150 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rudeegraap said Sendoso will be using the funds in part to invest in a couple of areas. First, to hire more talent: it has 500 employees now and plans to grow that by 30% by the end of this year. And second, international expansion: it is setting up a European HQ in Dublin, Ireland to complement its main office in San Francisco.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Comcast, Kimpton Hotels, Thomson Reuters, Nasdaq and eBay are among its current customers &#8212; so this is in part to serve those customers&#8217; global user bases, as well as to sign up new gifters. He estimated that the bigger market for corporate gifting is about $100 billion annually, so there is a lot to play for here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company was co-founded by Rudeegraap and Braydan Young (who is its chief alliances officer) on the back of a specific need Rudeegraap identified while working as a sales executive. Gifting is a very standard practice in the world of sales and marketing, but he was finding a lot of traction with potential and current customers by taking a personalized approach to this act.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;I was manually packing boxes, grabbing swag, coming up with handwritten notes,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;It was inefficient, but it worked so well. So I dreamed up an idea: why not be able to click a button in Salesforce to do this automatically? Sometimes the best company is one that solves a pain point of your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is essentially what Sendoso does. The startup&#8217;s platform integrates with a company&#8217;s existing marketing, sales and management software &#8212; Salesforce, HubSpot, SalesLoft <a href="https://sendoso.com/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among them</a> &#8212; and then lets users use this to organize and order gifts through these channels, for example as part of larger sales, marketing or HR strategies. The gifts are wide-ranging, covering corporate swag, other physical presents, gift cards and more, and there are also integrations you can include to share gifting across teams of salespeople, to analyze the campaigns and more.</p>
<p>The Sendoso platform itself, meanwhile, positions itself as having the &#8220;marketplace selection and logistics precision of Amazon.com.&#8221; But Sendoso also believes it&#8217;s better than someone simply using Amazon.com itself since it ultimately takes a more personalized approach in how it presents the gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of things we do uniquely in terms of what we have built throughout our software, gifting options and logistics centre. We really personalize our gifts at scale with handwritten notes, special boxing, and more,&#8221; something that Amazon cannot do, he added. &#8220;We have built a lot of unique technology and logistics software that would make it hard for Amazon to compete.&#8221; He said that one of Sendoso&#8217;s integrations is actually with Amazon, so Sendoso users can order through there, but then the gift is first routed to Sendoso to be repackaged in a nicer way before being sent out.</p>
<p>At its heart, the startup has built a way of knitting together disparate work practices &#8212; some codified in software, and some based on human interactions and significantly more infused with randomness, emotion and ad hoc approaches &#8212; and built it all into a technology platform. The ability to scale what feels like an otherwise bespoke level of service is what has helped Sendoso gain traction not just with users, but investors, too:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We believe Sendoso offers the most comprehensive end-to-end gifting platform in the market,” said Priya Saiprasad, a partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. &#8220;Their platform includes a global marketplace of curated vendors, seamless integration with existing tools, global logistics, and deep analytics. As a result, Sendoso serves as the backbone to enterprises’ engagement programs with prospective customers, existing customers, employees and other key stakeholders. We&#8217;re excited to lead this Series C round to help Sendoso accelerate its vision.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The funding raise comes as Immi releases a reformulation of their product this year aimed at replicating traditional instant ramen in broth taste, mouthfeel, texture and slurp ability.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://immieats.com/">Immi</a> is putting a healthy spin on instant ramen by going plant-based and offering more bold tastes. The company announced Tuesday that it raised $3.8 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founders Kevin Lee and Kevin Chanthasiriphan both grew up in food families from Taiwan and Thailand, respectively, and met a decade ago while working at the same tech company. They bonded over getting noodles every day.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and they both saw family members stricken with diabetes and high blood pressure and started thinking about what a better-for-you food and beverage brand would look like.</p>
<p>Taking the love of the Asian food they grew up with, they wanted to develop one of those brands for the U.S.</p>
<p>“We immediately agreed on instant ramen,” Chanthasiriphan told TechCrunch. “My dad still eats instant ramen each night, and it is such a massive market: 4 billion packets are sold per year, but it is also a product that has been dominated by the same three incumbents for years.”</p>

<p>Their take on it is Immi, which is plant-based, low carb and low sodium, high fiber and has 22 grams of protein on average. The product comes in three flavors — Black Garlic “Chicken,” Tom Yum “Shrimp” and Spicy “Beef.”</p>
<p>The pair went into the company full-time in 2019 and have spent the better part of the last few years heads down in R&amp;D, but the finished product didn’t come easy. In fact, when speaking with people in the industry, they were told that creating a healthier version of ramen would be “kind of impossible,” Lee said. They had to start from the ground up and make it themselves, formulating the first recipes in their own kitchens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The funding raise comes as Immi releases a reformulation of their product this year aimed at replicating traditional instant ramen in broth taste, mouthfeel, texture and slurpability.</p>
<p>Siddhi Capital led the round and was joined by Palm Tree Crew, Constellation Capital, Animal Capital, Pear Ventures, Collaborative Fund and a group of individuals, including Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kat Cole and Nik Sharma, as well as executives from Thrive Market, Caviar, Daring Foods, Madhappy, Twitch, Kettle &amp; Fire, MUD\WTR, Native, Amity Supply, Visionary Music Group, Italic, Tatcha and Casper.</p>
<p>Melissa Facchina, co-founder and general partner at Siddhi Capital, said her firm invests in food and beverage brands and its investment arm is a mentor to the Immi team.</p>
<p>“We were blown away by them,” she said. “It costs a lot of money to innovate in this industry, and it is exciting for myself and family to have something that we can grab and go. The second version launching looks exactly like the traditional brick pack and now has adult flavors that attach to a different culinary pallet.”</p>
<p>The natural or better-for-you foods industry has changed “dramatically” in the last decade,  Facchina said. Most of it is driven by consumers that want transparency in the supply chain, cleaner ingredients and authentic brands.</p>
<p>Consumer packaged goods brands that are reinventing themselves already have successful product lines, but few brands are taking a look at certain categories she said are ripe for reinvention, like cereal. Her firm is an investor in Magic Spoon, and she sees Immi reinventing ramen and Asian cuisine, saying “the Kevins as a founder group are highly moldable, high-achieving and want to surround themselves with best-in-class people.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Back to School: Wide World of Ramen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/back-to-school-wide-world-of-ramen/embed/#?secret=glGlVfKe3V" data-secret="glGlVfKe3V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will be split between R&amp;D, hiring and marketing, Lee said. The company is taking in customer feedback to enhance the flavors, and would like to optimize its supply chain, hire for key executive roles and put spending toward testing new marketing channels. Immi sells its product via its own online store, but would like to expand into wholesale channels and online grocers.</p>
<p>Immi’s products were launched in January and saw inventory sell out in the first month without any marketing. They have since sold over 10,000 orders across the U.S. and are even looking to go international.</p>
<p>Going forward, the company will be working on two initiatives: The first is to develop an infrastructure to expand its product offerings, like more flavors and noodle types, so it can launch a new flavor every few months. Lee and Chanthasiriphan also aim to develop additional Asian food products that have cleaner ingredients, like snacks and confections, that they loved eating when they were children.</p>
<p>The second is marketing and distribution. The company has amassed a community of 4,000 members that help Immi with rapid taste testing.</p>
<p>“We are figuring out how to bring our products to a more mainstream audience, especially those that may not be following a certain diet, but want to bring in food and beverages that are healthier,” Lee said. “We are also bringing in taste makers of culture, celebrities and TikTok influencers to broaden consumer interest and bring Immi into the mainstream cluster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new lawsuit threatens a decades-long collaboration that brought Skype, robot delivery startup Starship Technologies and encrypted enterprise messaging service Wire into the world.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has learned that Mark Dyne, one of Skype&#8217;s founding investors, is suing billionaire Skype co-founder Janus Friis in California&#8217;s Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles for unlawful conspiracy in his business dealings.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is complex, with plenty of twists, turns and allegations. The heart of the dispute is whether Dyne and his partners, who had managed some of Friis&#8217;s investments, were working for — or simply with — the Skype co-founder when they organized a rescue package for Wire in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At stake is who gets to control Wire and the financial return each side gets from Starship. </span></p>
<p>Dyne and his investor partners accuse Friis of illegally replacing one of them as a director of a general partnership that manages Wire, and conspiring to reduce their interest in Starship Technologies. Dyne and his partners also allege (and dismiss) accusations by Friis that they had fiduciary duties to him when they found funding for and restructured Wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Friis] unfortunately believes he is always entitled to have what he wants, can force others to do what he wants, and can re-write history (and agreements) whenever it suits his present purpose,&#8221; reads the complaint, filed in July, but not previously reported.</p>
<h2>Founding stories</h2>
<p>Dyne was a key player in the history of Skype, as one of its original investors and its first board member. He remained on the board through its sale to eBay for more than $2.6 billion in 2005, and was part of the group that bought Skype from eBay in 2009. He was still on the board when it was eventually sold to Microsoft in 2011.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dyne and Friis worked together extensively in the years after Skype. Dyne was an investor and board member of Friis&#8217;s ill-fated music streaming service Rdio, which filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Like Friis, he also served as a director of the general partners of the Iconical investment funds that funded Wire to the tune of more than $64.5 million between 2013 and 2018, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Wire, launched by ex-Skype and Microsoft engineers, offers secure end-to-end encrypted messaging, file sharing, voice and video calls. Friis hoped Wire would become &#8220;the new Skype,&#8221; according to the lawsuit, but became disenchanted after it failed to scale quickly, and then pivoted to enterprise. Five years after its launch, Wire had acquired only about 150,000 users, all of whom were non-revenue generating, the lawsuit notes, and was burning through $8 to $10 million a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friis has a history of abandoning companies when they did not achieve their early objectives in his sole opinion,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. In addition, it states, Friis himself was highly involved with the design of the robots, the logo and the software app at Starship Technologies.</p>
<h2>A turning point</h2>
<p>At this point, the men were apparently still friends. They were working on a new venture referred to in the lawsuit only as &#8220;Project X,&#8221; and in 2017, Friis even donated $500,000 to Dyne&#8217;s charitable foundation.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the lawsuit says that Friis cut off the flow of cash from Wire&#8217;s loan facility and sent a text message to Dyne, reading: &#8220;Want to make sure we are ready to put everything into a Foundation if all else fails.&#8221; Wire would become free open source software, with the foundation responsible for setting terms for open source licenses. Friis envisioned himself, Wire&#8217;s CTO Alan Duric and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales sitting on its board.</p>
<p>But Dyne and his partners had a different idea. In early 2019, when Wire was only days away from shutting down, according to the lawsuit, Dyne and his partners quickly pulled together an $8 million Series A including them, Marbruck Investments and Wire&#8217;s own executive management team.</p>
<p>Friis told others that Dyne had &#8220;pulled off a miracle&#8221; in finding this financing, states the lawsuit. Although the Iconical funds would remain Wire&#8217;s single-largest shareholder, the transaction would, apparently, remove the company from Friis&#8217;s direct control.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says that following the round, Friis called Duric &#8220;a completely f**king disaster&#8221; and hastened to sever all ties with the company. It alleges he missed board meetings and did not speak to Morten Brøgger, Wire&#8217;s CEO, for nearly a year and a half.</p>
<p>That seems to have changed this year, following Wire&#8217;s $21 million Series B round. In May, Friis insisted that Wire be redomiciled in Germany, the lawsuit states: &#8220;In hindsight, this was clearly part of Friis&#8217;s undisclosed plan to reacquire control of Wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a Zoom (not Skype or Wire) call in October, says the lawsuit, Friis alleged that if the terms of the Wire transaction had been made clear to him and he had been properly advised, he would have never agreed to it, blaming Dyne and his partners. He also replaced one of them as a director and stalled meetings, it says.</p>
<h2>The fight over Starship</h2>
<p>Nor are Friis&#8217;s actions limited to Wire, according to the lawsuit. It says that Friis was always vexed that he did not have a controlling interest in the sidewalk robot delivery startup Starship, which was structured as a 50/50 deal with another Skype alumnus, Ahti Heinla. The lawsuit includes a screengrab of a text from Friis to Dyne suggesting if that structure could be remedied &#8220;in a way that was set in stone, one would easily pay [$]10-15 million for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Friis conspired with one of his companies to inaccurately claim Starship as a &#8220;controlled portfolio company&#8221; of one of the Iconical funds. This would inflate his own interest in it at the expense of Dyne and his partners &#8220;to the point where [our] interest is no longer a financeable asset in the secondary markets,&#8221; it says. &#8220;Friis will say or do anything in order to suit his present fiction, no matter the cost to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dyne did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Friis&#8217; legal team filed a motion to quash the lawsuit on Friday, on the grounds that Friis &#8212; a Danish citizen living in London &#8212; is not subject to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The motion stated: &#8220;More than a decade ago, Dyne [and partner] recognized they could profit handsomely if they hitched their wagon to Friis. And over the ensuing years, while extracting millions of dollars&#8217; worth of fees and profit interests, they pretended they were acting as Friis&#8217;s and his entities&#8217; trusted fiduciaries overseeing and managing Friis&#8217;s various venture capital pursuits. But in reality&#8230; Plaintiffs had a single-minded focus of advancing their own commercial interests at the expense of Friis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friis&#8217;s lawyers also provided TechCrunch with the following statement: &#8220;Dyne&#8217;s defective lawsuit is a defensive reaction to questions raised regarding his and his team&#8217;s conduct&#8230; Although we believe that the allegations in the complaint are irresponsible, incomplete, and without merit, they also effectively concede that Dyne and his team breached fiduciary duties over their decade-plus relationship as trusted advisers. We look forward to fully addressing these matters in litigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outcome of this lawsuit, which is still in its early days, is likely to have little immediate impact on the operations of either Starship, which has made over 1.5 million autonomous deliveries and recently snagged ex-Google Loon chief Alastair Westgarth as its CEO, or Wire, which completed its pivot to enterprise customers and enjoyed some success during the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it does spell the end of a dream team that has created some of the most interesting and influential startups of the 21st century so far.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truepic, a digital image verification software provider, has raised $26 million in a Series B funding round led by M12, Microsoft’s venture fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV, Hearst Ventures and individuals from Stone Point Capital also participated in the financing, which brings San Diego-based Truepic’s total raised since its 2015 inception to $36 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than trying to detect what is fake, <a href="http://www.truepic.com">Truepic</a> says its patented “secure” camera technology proves what is real. The startup’s technology acquires “provenance” data (such as origin, contents and metadata) about photos and videos and uses cryptography to protect the images from tampering before they reach the intended recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the company says its software can authenticate where photos were taken and prove that they were not manipulated since there are an increasing number of deceptive photos and personal information that can be purchased on the Dark Web, social media and via software that can change the metadata of an image’s time or location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach is unique in that we are verifying the authenticity of content at the point it is captured, which is also referred to as ‘provenance-based media authentication’ versus detecting anomalies or edits post-capture,” Truepic CEO Jeff McGregor told TechCrunch. “We believe that detection of fake images and videos will not be viable or scalable. Provenance-based media authentication is the most promising approach to universal visual trust online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truepic’s camera technology is software-based, and runs on mobile devices. Photos and videos captured through its camera are cryptographically assured to be unedited, original images, according to McGregor, with “trusted” metadata such as time, date and location. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Truepic’s technology &#8212; for which it has 13 patents &#8212; has been popular among an increasing number of financial services companies, McGregor said. Insurance companies, for example, are using it to verify claims remotely. This has been particularly meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in its early days when in-person interaction was avoided at all costs. But it also has a number of other use cases, he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company must be doing something right. Its technology is used by over 100 enterprises, such as Equifax, EXL Service Inc, Ford Motor Company, Accion Opportunity Fund and Palomar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last year, Truepic says its revenues grew by over 300% thanks to “dramatic client growth” across the insurance, banking, automotive, peer-to-peer commerce, project management and international development industries. McGregor declined to reveal hard revenue figures, though, so it’s hard to know just how significant 300% revenue growth is. He added that the company is intentionally not yet profitable as it is currently focused on speed of distribution for its core technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use cases for Truepic’s technology, according to McGregor, are quite broad given how pervasive untrusted photos and videos are. Its customers include any organization that is ingesting digital photo or video content, and requires a high level of trust in that content. For example, it works with insurance companies, banks, peer to peer commerce, online marketplaces, real estate and franchise organizations, warranty providers and automotive companies, among others. Generally, companies with platforms that rely on visual media &#8212; such as home rental, news media, online dating, social media, e-commerce, sharing economy, traditional media &#8212; can benefit from Truepic’s technology, according to McGregor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We imagine a world where the origin and authenticity of all digital content is verifiable, allowing humans to gain higher trust in what they view online,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M12 Principal James Wu said that t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he number of deep-fake videos and synthetic media online is growing at an exponential rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Used nefariously, manipulated media can result in negative political discourse, reputational consequences, and fraudulent claims,” he wrote via email. “The pervasiveness of synthetic media is a growing business risk for corporations &#8212; especially established brands &#8212; and solutions like Truepic will become an integral part of an enterprise’s end-to-end fraud management strategy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Truepic as a “pioneer” in provenance technology, which M12 believes is the most reliable way to establish the integrity of the data contained in photo and video files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a great deal of investment in synthetic media, but very few are thinking about the other side of the coin &#8212; when synthetic media is used nefariously,” he said. “Truepic is at the forefront of providing tools to maintain a shared sense of reality online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part toward speeding up the release of a new product, Truepic Lens, that will power “trusted” image capture in third-party applications, “regardless of industry or use-case,” McGregor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will create a single integration point for any customer that requires trusted media to run their service,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to use the new capital to increase distribution for its current flagship product, Truepic Vision, a “turnkey” platform for requesting and “instant” reviewing of trusted photos and videos from anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also, naturally, plans to hire. It currently has 50 employees, up from about 25 a year ago. McGregor expects Truepic’s team will double to 100 over the next 18 months. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 51 of its Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Monday night at 8:55 PM PDT (11:55 PM EDT). This was the first launch for the Starlink satellite internet constellation from the west coast, and also the first batch of a second stage of Starlink satellite deployment, targeting a new orbital trajectory that will help the network provide service to new regions including Northern Canada and parts of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>The launch used a reflown Falcon 9 that had previously supported nine other missions, including seven prior Starlink flights. In total, SpaceX has now launched around 1,800 Starlink satellites, and it has been providing coverage to customers during its beta program for over a year now. The company said in August that it has now shipped around 100,000 terminals to customers, with over 90,000 active users on the service at the moment and a full order volume of around 500,000 kits in total.</p>

<p>SpaceX plans to expand the constellation considerably in order to continue to grow the footprint of where Starlink service is available globally. It ultimately aims to build out the constellation to where it consists of nearly 30,000 satellites, which should provide reliable worldwide broadband coverage for customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months ago, Ambi Robotics emerged from stealth with a $6 million raise. Today the Bay Area-based firm is back with several times that, announcing a $26 million Series A, led by Tiger Global. The new round also features participation from existing investors, including Bow Capital, Vertex Ventures US and The House Fund.</p>
<p>The startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/robotics-roundup-6/"> first hit our radar</a> through the involvement of UC Berkeley (and frequent TC Sessions: Robotics guest Ken Goldberg). Ambi operates in the pick and place robotics space &#8212; it’s a crowded category, but one with an intense level of interest, as more warehouse and fulfillment centers are accelerating toward automation after the shutdowns of the past year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Ambi has already enlisted some high-profile partners, including Pitney Bowes. In spite of only coming out of stealth in April, the robotics startup began deploying its first systems &#8212; including the AmbiSort and AmbiKit &#8212; in October of last year, ahead of the massive holiday rush.</p>

<hr />
<p>The company’s primary differentiation is in the AI that powers its picking robotics system.</p>
<p>“Ambi Robotics combines cutting-edge AI technology with engaging user interfaces to transform the role of ‘item handlers’ to ‘robot handlers,’ ” CEO Jim Liefer said in a release. “With our Series A funding, we will be able to empower more companies to help their associates work harmoniously alongside robots.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round will go toward scaling both the systems and the team of humans that build them, and deploying additional units.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More startup swapping in the food delivery space: Spain&#8217;s Glovo, an on-demand delivery platform which operates a network of dark stores focused on urban convenience shopping, is pushing deeper into planned grocery shopping &#8212; announcing the acquisition of two regional &#8216;Instacart-style&#8217; grocery picking and delivery startups, Madrid-based Lola Market and Portugal&#8217;s Mercadão.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisitions are not being disclosed.</p>
<p>2015-founded Lola Market had raised around €3M, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lola-market/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. It&#8217;s not clear how much Portugal&#8217;s Mercadão &#8212; which was founded in 2018 &#8212; had raised over its shorter run.</p>
<p>Glovo, meanwhile, raised a meaty <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528M Series F back in April</a> &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">quickly splurged $208M</a> to pick up three food delivery brands from rival Delivery Hero in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Spanish on-demand delivery platform is facing challenges to its model on home turf where the government has applied a labor reform aimed at delivery workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The reform, agreed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/gig-economy-crackdowns-are-off-to-a-bad-start-in-spain">came into application last month </a>&#8212; recognizing delivery platform riders as employees, or at least on paper.</p>
<p>Glovo responded by imposing a new self-employment model on the vast majority of riders on its platform, hiring only around a fifth. So the scene looks set for legal challenges in its home market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the European Union level, lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">eyeing how to improve conditions for platform workers</a> &#8212; and could come with pan-EU legislation that has wider implications for the business models of regional players like Glovo.</p>

<p>Ongoing regulatory challenges over employment classification and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/italys-dpa-fines-glovo-owned-foodinho-3m-orders-changes-to-algorithmic-management-of-riders/">algorithmic management of workers in the gig economy</a> may offer some context for Glovo&#8217;s expanding interest in grocery purchasing in Europe, where it has been building out a network of dark stores to power what it calls &#8216;Q-commerce&#8217; (aka, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">quick urban convenience shopping</a>).</p>
<p>As well as for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/glovo-to-double-down-african-investment-in-the-next-12-months-but-will-it-stay-put/">recently announced international expansion in Africa</a>, where it has said it will be doubling down investment over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>But also the challenge of hitting profitability for pure on-demand food delivery looks like a sizeable piece of the puzzle here driving consolidation.</p>
<p>By adding players in the supermarket and retail outlet picking delivery space, Glovo expands its coverage of shoppers&#8217; needs &#8212; and can nudge users to spend more by being able to cross-sell them on planned purchases (such as the weekly grocery shop), as well as what it bills as &#8220;emergency essentials&#8221; and &#8220;fast action convenience&#8221; powered by the more limited inventory it can offer in its city center dark stores.</p>
<p>Both Lola Market and Mercadão&#8217;s brand identities will be retained, per Glovo, which also says they will operate independently &#8212; led by Gonçalo Soares da Costa, CEO of Mercadão.</p>
<p>It touts the acquisitions as strengthening its competitive position in Europe in &#8220;key markets&#8221; &#8212; going on to suggest it will add grocery picking and delivery across its entire market footprint, with an initial expansion planned for Poland and Italy.</p>
<p>Also today it said its Q-Commerce division is &#8220;on track&#8221; to reach an annual Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of more than €300M this year &#8212; adding that it expects that to more than triple by the end of 2022, projecting it will surpass a run rate of €1BN.</p>
<p>Commenting on its latest acquisitions in a statement, Oscar Pierre, CEO and co-founder of Glovo, added: “We see huge potential in the on-demand groceries marketplace and both companies are strong local players in their respective markets, and further strengthen our Q-Commerce offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Lola Market and Mercadão on board, we can build stronger partnerships with retailers, offer our users big-basket purchases and provide a more complete service. These acquisitions represent a significant step forward for us, as we’re now able to cover all of the main purchasing considerations for groceries customers, making Glovo a one-stop-shop for e-groceries.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company captures diverse microbes for agricultural applications, like crop protection, and screens strains for the best assays that would work for insect, disease and nematode control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://agbiome.com">AgBiome</a>, developing products from microbial communities, brought in a $116 million Series D round as the company prepares to pad its pipeline with new products.</p>
<p>The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., was co-founded in 2012 by a group including co-CEOs Scott Uknes and Eric Ward, who have known each other for over 30 years. They created the Genesis discovery platform to capture diverse microbes for agricultural applications, like crop protection, and screen the strains for the best assays that would work for insect, disease and nematode control.</p>
<p>“The microbial world is immense,” said Uknes, who explained that there is estimated to be a trillion microbes, but only 1% have been discovered. The microbes already discovered are used by humans for things like pharmaceuticals, food and agriculture. AgBiome built its database in Genesis to house over 100,000 microbes and every genome in every microbe was sequenced into hundreds of strains.</p>
<p>The company randomly selects strains and looks for the best family of strains with a certain activity, like preventing fungus on strawberries, and creates the product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201815" style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201815" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2201815" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AgBiome-co-CEOs.png?w=599" alt="" width="599" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AgBiome-co-CEOs.png 599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AgBiome-co-CEOs.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AgBiome-co-CEOs.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AgBiome-co-CEOs.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201815" class="wp-caption-text">AgBiome co-CEOs Scott Uknes and Eric Ward. I<strong>mage Credits:</strong> AgBiome</p></div></p>
<p>Its first fungicide product, Howler, was launched last year and works on more than 300 crop-disease combinations. The company saw 10x sales growth in 2020, Uknes told TechCrunch. As part of farmers’ integrated pest program, they often spray fungicide applications 12 times per year in order to yield fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Due to its safer formula, Howler can be used as the last spray in the program, and its differentiator is a shorter re-entry period — farmers can spray in the morning and be able to go back out in the field in the afternoon. It also has a shorter pre-harvest time of four hours after application. Other fungicides on the market today require seven days before re-entry and pre-harvest, Uknes explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AgBiome aims to add a second fungicide product, Theia, in early 2022, while a third, Esendo was submitted for Environmental Protection Agency registration. Uknes expects to have 11 products, also expanding into insecticides and herbicides, by 2025.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed Series D round was co-led by Blue Horizon and Novalis LifeSciences and included multiple new and existing investors. The latest investment gives AgBiome over $200 million in total funding to date. The company’s last funding round was a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agbiome-llc-secures-series-c-funding-300681836.html">$65 million Series C</a> raised in 2018.</p>
<p>While competitors in synthetic biology often sell their companies to someone who can manufacture their products, Uknes said AgBiome decided to manufacture and commercialize the products itself, something he is proud of his team for being able to do.</p>
<p>“We want to feed the world responsibly, and these products have the ability to substitute for synthetic chemicals and provide growers a way to protect their crops, especially as consumers want natural, sustainable tools,” he added.</p>
<p>The company has grown to over 100 employees and will use the new funding to accelerate production of its two new products, building out its manufacturing capacity in North America and expanding its footprint internationally. Uknes anticipates growing its employee headcount to 300 in the next five years.</p>

<p>AgBiome anticipates rolling up some smaller companies that have a product in production to expand its pipeline in addition to its organic growth. As a result, Uknes said he was particular about the kind of investment partners that would work best toward that goal.</p>
<p>Przemek Obloj, managing partner at Blue Horizon, was introduced to the company by existing investors. His firm has an impact fund focused on the future of food and began investing in alternative proteins in 2016 before expanding that to delivery systems in agriculture technology, he said.</p>
<p>Obloj said AgBiome is operating in a $60 billion market where the problems include products that put toxic chemicals into the ground that end up in water systems. While the solution would be to not do that, not doing that would mean produce doesn’t grow as well, he added.</p>
<p>The change in technology in agriculture is enabling Uknes and Ward to do something that wasn’t possible 10 years ago because there was not enough compute or storage power to discover and sequence microbes.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to pollute the Earth, but we have to find a way to feed 9 billion people by 2050,” Obloj said. “With AgBiome, there is an alternative way to protect crops than by polluting the Earth or having health risks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Group Corp. is doubling down on its commitment to Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Japanese investment conglomerate is announcing the launch of the SoftBank Latin America Fund II, its second dedicated private investment fund focused on tech companies located in LatAm. SoftBank is launching the new fund with an initial $3 billion commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fund II will explore options to raise additional capital,” SoftBank said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new fund builds upon SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America Fund, which was first announced in March 2019 and was formerly called the Innovation Fund with </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an initial $2 billion in committed capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the firm, that fund has generated a net IRR of 85% &#8212; with SoftBank having invested $3.5 billion in <a href="https://www.latinamericafund.com/portfolio">48 companies</a> with a fair value of $6.9 billion as of June 30. SoftBank has invested in 15 unicorns out of that fund, including proptech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/sao-paulos-quintoandar-real-estate-platform-raises-120m-now-valued-at-5-1b/">QuintoAndar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">Rappi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/mercado-bitcoin-raises-200m/">Mercado Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/gympass-the-corporate-wellness-unicorn-raises-a-220m-series-e/">Gympass</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/madeiramadeira-brazils-answer-to-wayfair-and-ikea-is-now-worth-over-1-billion/">MadeiraMadeira</a>. Recently, it co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/argentine-fintech-uala-lands-350m-at-a-2-45b-valuation/">a $350 million Series D round</a> in Argentine personal finance management app Ualá.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also says it has participated in &#8220;significant value uplift” for portfolio companies, including 4.4x each for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/">Kavak</a> and VTEX; 2.6x for QuintoAndar and 3.5x for Banco Inter (as of June 30).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has backed companies across the region including in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcelo Claure, Executive VP and COO of SoftBank Group, leads the SoftBank Latin America Funds. Managing Partners Shu Nyatta and Paulo Passoni run the region’s investment team. Operating Partner Alex Szapiro, also head of Brazil for SoftBank, leads the fund’s operations team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment and operations teams total over 60 people who operate out of Miami, São Paulo and Mexico City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund II intends to back technology-enabled companies across countries and industries at every stage of their development, from seed to public, throughout Latin America, with a focus on e-commerce, digital financial services, healthcare, education, blockchain and enterprise software, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, SoftBank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son described Latin America as &#8220;one of the most important economic regions in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SoftBank will continue to drive technology adoption that will benefit hundreds of millions of people in this part of the world,” he said. “There is so much innovation and disruption taking place in Latin America, and I believe the business opportunities there have never been stronger. Latin America is a critical part of our strategy – this is why we are expanding our presence and doubling down on our commitment with Marcelo at the helm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claure said the success and returns from the SoftBank Latin America Fund “far exceeded” the firm’s expectations. Looking ahead, he expects that 2022 will be the “biggest IPO year” in the region’s history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, TechCrunch looked at why global investors were flocking to Latin America. At that time, Nyatta told me </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that technology in LatAm is often more about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inclusion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">disruption</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The vast majority of the population is underserved in almost every category of consumption. Similarly, most businesses are underserved by modern software solutions,” Nyatta explained. “There’s so much to build for so many people and businesses. In San Francisco, the venture ecosystem makes life a little better for individuals and businesses who are already living in the future. In LatAm, tech entrepreneurs are building the future for everyone else.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Helsinki-based VC <a href="http://Maki.vc">Maki.vc</a> is poised to reach the final close of its second fund at €100 million, with the aim to invest in seed-stage startups across Europe.</p>
<p>The first investments from the new fund include UK-based Baseimmune (antigen discovery and vaccine design), Volare (Foodtech), and PixieRay (adaptive eyeglasses).</p>
<p>Maki.vc’s initial ticket sizes range from €250,000 to €3 million. The VC’s first €80M fund invested in sustainable textile fiber producer Spinnova, quantum computing team IQM, and Oatly’s partner for carbon labeling, CarbonCloud.</p>
<p>In a statement, Maki.vc’s Founding Partner Ilkka Kivimäki said: “Within the deep tech and brand-driven focus, we have no industry or geographical restrictions, but instead we look for relentless founders. Common to the most advanced technologies and most captivating brands is their ability to approach the world’s greatest challenges in unconventional ways.”</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch Kivimäki added: “We have 77 investments already in the new fund. So up and running and hitting the ground running.”</p>
<p>Is there a change in strategy?</p>
<p>“Actually, very little,” he said. “We were already talking about the sustainability aspect. I think that that is going to many more new materials, new processes, including all of the food tech stuff. And we are definitely not shying away from hardware and complex things. We were initial investors in IQM which is the quantum computer. We were the only venture investor in a company called Spinnova which is making yarn from wood fibers.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new fund is backed by 70+ LPs comprising of exited entrepreneurs and corporate executives, including Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and Teleport co-founder Sten Tamkivi, Supercell co-founder &amp; CEO Ilkka Paananen, Wolt co-founders Oskari Petas and Mika Matikainen, Small Giant Games chair of the board Timo<br />
Soininen, chair of the board at Ensto Marjo Miettinen and Seriously CEO &amp; co-founder Petri Järvilehto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) <a href="http://www.ftc.go.kr/www/selectReportUserView.do?key=10&amp;rpttype=1&amp;report_data_no=9254">said</a> on Tuesday it fined Google $177 million for abusing its market dominance in the Android operating system (OS) market.</p>
<p>The U.S. tech company has restricted market competition by prohibiting local smartphone makers like Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics from customizing their Android OS, through Google’s anti-fragmentation agreements (AFA), according to the antitrust regulator statement.</p>
<p>Under the AFA, smartphone developers are not allowed to install or develop “Android forks”, modified versions of Android.</p>
<p>The KFTC banned Google LLC, Google Asia Pacific and Google Korea from imposing local smartphone developers to sign the AFA and ordered to make changes on details about the existing version. The new measure in South Korea will be applied to not only mobiles devices but also other Android-powered smart devices including watches and TVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/overview">Android&#8217;s compatibility program</a> has spurred innovation among Korean mobile operator owners and software developers and that has led to a better user experience for Korean consumers, Google said in its statement. “The KFTC’s decision released today ignores these benefits, and will undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers. Google intends to appeal the KFTC’s decision,” a spokesperson at Google said.</p>
<p>The commission has been investigating Google over the anti-competition practice in OS market since July 2016, a spokesperson at KFTC said.</p>

<p>Google’s global mobile OS market share excluding China has been increased to 97.7% in 2019 from 38% in 2010, as per KFTC’s announcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.passfort.com">PassFort</a>, a SaaS provider that helps business meet compliance requirements such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) reporting, has closed a $16.2 million Series A led by US growth equity fund, Level Equity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/ef4/">2015-founded startup</a>&#8216;s existing investors OpenOcean, Episode 1 and Entrepreneur First also participated in the round. The Series A is a mix of equity and debt, with $4.89M worth of venture debt being provided by Shard Credit Partners.</p>
<p>PassFort tells TechCrunch it now has 54 customers in total, saying the majority are in the digital payments space. It&#8217;s also selling its SaaS to customers in foreign exchange, banking and (ofc) crypto. It also touts some &#8220;major&#8221; customer wins preceding this raise &#8212; name-checking the likes of Curve and WorldRemit.</p>
<p>The new funding will be put towards stepping up its growth globally &#8212; with PassFort noting it&#8217;s hired a new C-suite for its growth team to lead the planned global push.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also hiring more staff in business development and marketing, and plans to significantly bump spending across marketing, sales and customer support roles as it gears up to scale up.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the product side we are developing the solution to meet the demands of the changing digital economy and the threats it faces,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Donald Gillies. &#8220;This means investing heavily into our new compliance policy cloud, system-to-system integrations with market-leading CRM and transaction monitoring systems as well as building a data team capable of deriving valuable real-time insights across our customer network.&#8221;</p>
<p>PassFort says its revenues grew ~2.5x over the past 12 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gillies credits COVID-19 with really hitting the digital &#8220;accelerator&#8221; and driving adoption for compliance tools, as fintechs and regulated businesses look to streamline their approach to customer on-boarding and risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Alongside this accelerated digital transformation, he also points to a rise in cyber crime and increasingly sophisticated financial crime driving demand for compliance tools, and a &#8220;huge&#8221; rise in the number of regulations announced since COVID-19, noting: &#8220;Estimates from those who track regulatory changes stated that by August 2020, more than 1,330 COVID-19 related regulatory announcements had been made globally by regulators.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as serving up an &#8220;always-on picture of risk&#8221;, as PassFort&#8217;s marketing puts it, the platform offers a single place to access and manage customer profiles, while also centralizing records for audit purposes.</p>
<p>PassFort&#8217;s SaaS also tracks efficiency &#8212; supporting customers to see where holdups in the onboarding process might be, to help with customer experience as well as the wider support it offers to compliance teams.</p>
<p>The startup says its integration model is such that it can &#8220;ingest datasets from any provider and interoperate with any system&#8221;, so &#8212; for example &#8212; it has pre-built connectors to more than 25 data providers at this stage.</p>
<p>It also offers a single API to integrate with a customer&#8217;s existing back-office system.</p>
<p>Another feature of the SaaS it flags is a focus on &#8220;low to no-code&#8221; &#8212; to increase accessibility and help customers with high complexity in their compliance needs (such as multiple customer types, multiple product lines and multi-jurisdictions. This includes a smart policy builder with a &#8216;drag and drop&#8217; interface to help customers configure complex workflows.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, PassFort names Dublin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/fenergo-raises-80m-at-an-800m-valuation-for-compliance-and-other-fintech-services-aimed-at-banks/">Fenergo</a> as its closest competitor but says it&#8217;s targeting a broader market &#8212; likening its own product to &#8216;Salesforce for compliance teams&#8217; and saying its goal is to get the SaaS into the hands of &#8220;every financial crime and compliance team in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Charles Chen, partner at Level Equity &#8212; who&#8217;s now joining PassFort’s board of directors &#8212; added: “Over the last few years, financial institutions and organisations have experienced exponential growth in business volumes and data, which has only increased the complexity in staying compliant with ever-evolving regulatory laws. In parallel, we’ve experienced an unprecedented rise in sophisticated financial crime activity as channels into financial systems have been digitized.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has underscored the importance of compliance matters such as AML/KYC, yet companies often have to weigh the trade-offs between speed, compliance and automation. PassFort has solved this challenge by providing a next-generation RegTech software solution that enables customers to offer a seamless customer onboarding experience, maintain best-in-class monitoring capabilities, and balance automation vs. human touch via its intelligent orchestration engine. We are thrilled to partner with the industry thought leader in this space and look forward to supporting the company’s future growth initiatives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new iPhone models today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvGOlAkLSLw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">Rumor has it</a> that there will be a new generation of iPhone models. Reports suggest that the company is going to call it the iPhone 13 and that there will be four different models just like last year. Today, you can expect to learn more about the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<p>When it comes to new features, it’s safe to say that there will be big camera upgrades. This year, the company seems to be focused on video improvements in particular. The iPhone 13 should also come with a better display and a faster chip.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Apple is likely to use this opportunity to announce a new Apple Watch model. There will be bigger design changes with the Apple Watch Series 7 with sharp edges.</p>
<p>There could be more product announcements as Apple has been working on the AirPods 3. They will replace or complement the entry-level AirPods 2 in the audio lineup. The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max will remain unchanged for now.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a small chance that we get to hear more about new Macs with custom designed Apple chips as well as new iPad models…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the &#8216;Apple Special Event&#8217; section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/livestream/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India and Singapore are working to link their digital payments systems to enable “instant, low-cost fund transfers,” in a major push to disrupt the cross-border transactions between the two nations that amounts to over $1 billion each year.</p>
<p>The project to link India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Singapore’s PayNow is targeted for operationalization by July 2022, both nation&#8217;s central banks said on Tuesday. Users on either of the systems will be able to make transactions to one another without having to sign up to the second platform, the banks added.</p>
<p>&#8220;When implemented, fund transfers can be made from India to Singapore using mobile phone numbers, and from Singapore to India using UPI virtual payment addresses (VPA). The experience of making a PayNow transfer to a UPI VPA will be similar to that of a domestic transfer to a PayNow VPA,&#8221; said Monetary Authority of Singapore in a <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/singapores-paynow-and-indias-upi-to-link-in-2022">press statement</a>.</p>
<p>UPI, a five-year-old payments infrastructure developed by a coalition of retail banks, has become the most popular ways users in India transfer money to one another and to businesses.</p>
<p>The railroads, adopted by scores of local and global firms including Google and Facebook, is now processing over 3 billion transactions each month. Like UPI, Singapore&#8217;s PayNow also brings interoperability between banks and payments apps, allowing user from one payment app to make transaction to those on other apps.</p>
<p>Nearly 250 million people across the world send over $500 billion in cross-border remittances annually, a report by Citi said earlier this year. But the space is ripe for disruption. “The fees are extremely high. It is embarrassing that we have not solved this issue so far,” Citi analysts wrote. Global average cost for sending money is around 6.5%. The RBI and the MAS didn&#8217;t reveal the cross-border fees that they would charge their users.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s central bank <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=52223">described</a> the project as a &#8220;significant milestone in the development of infrastructure for cross-border payments&#8221; between India and Singapore, and said the linkage &#8220;closely aligns with the G20’s financial inclusion priorities of driving faster, cheaper and more transparent cross-border payments.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The linkage builds upon the earlier efforts of NPCI International Private Limited (NIPL) and Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS) to foster cross-border interoperability of payments using cards and QR codes, between India and Singapore and will further anchor trade, travel and remittance flows between the two countries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether or not Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom survives Tuesday&#8217;s recall election may depend to some degree on a small but vocal group of Silicon Valley power players who&#8217;ve thrown their weight behind the effort to oust him, including some who previously supported mostly Democratic politicians.</p>
<p>To better understand what happened, we talked recently with political economist and Stanford business school professor Neil Malhotra about research he conducted in 2017 about the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/predispositions-political-behavior-american-economic-elites-evidence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/predispositions-political-behavior-american-economic-elites-evidence" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/predispositions-political-behavior-american-economic-elites-evidence&quot;}">political attitudes of the tech elite</a> &#8212; and why some seemed so quick to turn on Newsom this year. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you get into this line of work?</strong></p>
<p>NM: It was motivated from a historical perspective. When you look at a lot of major changes in American politics and parties, a lot of them have been driven by major business interests and sources of wealth. A good example is the robber barons, including Leland Stanford at the turn of the century. And it looks like we&#8217;re going through a similar period right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Based on your research, how do attitudes of Silicon Valley folks differ from the California population, as well as the national population in general?</strong></p>
<p>NM: Just to be clear, I use Silicon Valley as a metaphor. A lot of these people are located in other areas of the country as well, like Boston, Austin, Research Triangle, Los Angeles, etc. But just generally, I think the attitudes of this group of technology elites is unique and something you don&#8217;t see in any other part of the population. I&#8217;ve called them liberal-terian. To distinguish them from libertarians, they tend to be very liberal on social issues and issues related to globalization, like immigration and free trade. And they support redistribution, so they have very high support for universal health care. But they&#8217;re very against government regulation. So this distinguishing between redistribution and regulation is what makes this population very unique, even among very rich people in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Meaning regulation around labor? Is this about limiting the number of skilled educated immigrants who can come to the U.S. or about gig workers or . . .?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NM: They are very, very supportive of immigration, and also very, very supportive of gig workers, and against the ability to restrict the labor market in any way.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also very, very anti union, which also distinguishes them from other people within the Democratic Party. I think the general belief system they have is to let the market operate and then afterward redistribute money through taxes and social programs, because they feel that this is what will grow the pie the biggest and still allow for equality, rather than putting a lot of restrictions in place <em>a priori</em>, which will shrink innovation, shrink the pie.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There are many in tech who talk about the redistribution of wealth but in practice shield their assets or their companies&#8217; assets. Any thoughts about how sincere they are about this, based on your research?</strong></p>
<p>NM: They are very supportive of high income taxes. But maybe that&#8217;s self-serving, given that a lot of their wealth comes from capital gains, and it&#8217;s very possible they would be less supportive of capital gains taxes, not because it takes away their wealth, but because they would feel that it stifles innovation.</p>
<p>One of the leading tech figures in Silicon Valley, Chamath Palihapitiya, has said that California&#8217;s high taxes was one of the reasons he was supporting the recall.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you find that in general, the supporters of the recall were citing taxation as an issue or are there other issues that were more front of mind?</strong></p>
<p>NM: The COVID restrictions [were also top of mind]. I think that there&#8217;s a sense that these tech entrepreneurs really identify with entrepreneurs, even if they&#8217;re not elite entrepreneurs, and that includes small business owners, restaurant owners, gym owners, small landlords. They feel like the government has been punishing these people over the course of the pandemic. Further, I think that in addition to being against unions, they&#8217;re generally against public sector unions like teachers unions. And so I think the restrictions on school openings also struck a chord with this population.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Newsom&#8217;s camp has raised quite a bit of money compared with his recall opponents. Do you think that the money raised in this recall effort is going to substantially impact turnout?</strong></p>
<p>NM: I think everything makes a difference on the margin. All that money does go to advertising get-out-the-vote efforts. But at the end of the day, if there&#8217;s a real movement, it can&#8217;t really overcome it. Hillary Clinton out-raised Trump tremendously, and I&#8217;m sure all that money did help. But the big question is going to be, who&#8217;s excited to turn out, who&#8217;s going to motivate, and they may need that $70 million to convince people who are not that excited about voting in this election to vote in it to save him.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A number of tech luminaries who have supported this recall. How does it benefit them if Newsom loses? It seems they&#8217;re betting on chaos in a way.</strong></p>
<p>NM: I think a good test case of this is [congressman] Ro Khanna. In his first campaign against Mike Honda [in 2014], he ran as a Silicon Valley technocrat and was supported by [Facebook COO Shery] Sandberg and all of these tech luminaries, and he lost that election. Then he shifted and became the Bernie Sanders guy and was, I think, the national co-chair of Bernie Sanders campaign, and now is this quasi &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squad_(United_States_Congress)">squad&#8221;</a> member that&#8217;s on the far left. I just think that&#8217;s really interesting. It&#8217;s almost like a microcosm of the Democratic Party first embracing the tech community, and then now being very against it. This recall could reshape those alliances again potentially,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BridgeLinx, a 9-month-old Lahore-headquartered startup that operates a digital freight marketplace, said on Tuesday it has raised $10 million in what is the largest seed financing round in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Harry Stebbings’ 20 VC, Josh Buckley’s Buckley Ventures and Indus Valley Capital co-led the startup’s financing round, which Salman Gul, co-founder and chief executive of BridgeLinx, told TechCrunch completed within weeks.</p>
<p>This is 20 VC and Buckley Ventures’ second lead investment in Pakistan in recent weeks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/pakistans-airlift-raises-85-million-for-its-quick-commerce-startup-eyes-international-expansion/">following an $85 million round in quick-commerce startup Airlift</a>. Indus Valley Capital, which recently also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/pakistans-b2b-marketplace-and-digital-ledger-platform-bazaar-raises-30-million/">backed business-to-business marketplace Bazaar</a>, has invested in all three of the recent high-profile investments in the South Asian country.</p>
<p>Wavemaker Partners, Quiet Capital, TrueSight Ventures, Soma Capital, Flexport, Magnus Rausing’s UNTITLED and founders of Convoy and Bazaar also participated in the round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bridgelinxpk.com">BridgeLinx</a> is building a digital freight marketplace. The platform connects shippers &#8212; such as manufacturing companies, cement factories, textile companies &#8212; with truckers and private fleets.</p>
<p>It also provides its tech solutions to ensure documents validation on both ends, timely pickups, port operations and safety of cargo, said Gul, who previously worked at consultancy firm KPMG in Canada.</p>
<p>BridgeLinx has already onboarded thousands of carriers and is moving thousands of freight-loads each week for many large customers, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As is true in India, Pakistan’s trucking system has a big inefficiency problem that continues to drag the economy.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems faced by truckers is that once they have made a delivery, they have no work left during the return journey. So a truck delivering something to Lahore from Islamabad is likely not carrying something on its way back to the nation&#8217;s capital. This decades-old inefficiency continues to cost every stakeholder.</p>
<p>Startups like BridgeLinx are attempting to find ways to make this system more efficient, said Gul, who added that he has closely studied how Convoy, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/indias-blackbuck-valued-at-1-billion-in-67-million-fundraise/">India’s BlackBuck</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">Rivigo</a> have expanded their businesses in the recent years.</p>
<p>BridgeLinx, like BlackBuck, currently operates on an asset-lite model &#8212; that is, it doesn&#8217;t own any vehicles. But Gul said there is benefit in replicating something from Rivigo, which owns its fleets. By having some trucks of its own, BridgeLinx will be able to ensure that vehicles on its platform are operating round the clock by having multiple drivers working in shifts.</p>
<p>“We will eventually have a hybrid of what BlackBuck and Rivigo offer,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand to more verticals and broaden its tech offerings. It is also working on hiring more talent, he said.</p>
<p>“BridgeLinx has cracked the code for making end-to-end freight work in a hassle free manner and therefore signed up some of the top businesses in Pakistan,&#8221; said Aatif Awan, Managing Partner at Indus Valley Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this team is well on its way to bring unprecedented efficiencies to the country’s economy and are really excited to partner with them.”</p>
<hr />
<p>On a side note, it&#8217;s fascinating to see Stebbings and Buckley emerge as the earliest investors to back startups in Pakistan at a time when several high-profile venture funds in Asia &#8212; including Sequoia Capital India, Accel, and Lightspeed &#8212; are yet to make any move in the country. Arguably, it&#8217;s the best time to back startups in Pakistan. The internet penetration has grown considerably in the country in the past decade and scores of startups are beginning to build the railroads for commerce, logistics, and payments.</p>
<p>Prosus has backed one startup in Pakistan &#8212; ride-hailing firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/prosus-ventures-leads-13-million-investment-in-pakistan-ride-hailing-giant-bykea/">Bykea</a> &#8212; and it recently made its first investment in Bangladesh &#8212; commerce startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/shopup-raises-22-5-million-to-digitize-millions-of-mom-and-pop-shops-in-bangladesh/">ShopUp</a>, which counts Sequoia as one of its earliest backers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese search engine giant Baidu has begun publicly testing its Apollo Go robotaxi mobile platform in Shanghai, marking the company&#8217;s continued expansion of its footprint in China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baidu says its robotaxis have achieved Level 4 capabilities, a human safety operator will be present during all rides, which are open to the public as of Sunday, in order to comply with local regulations. The</span><a href="https://www.sae.org/news/press-room/2018/12/sae-international-releases-updated-visual-chart-for-its-%E2%80%9Clevels-of-driving-automation%E2%80%9D-standard-for-self-driving-vehicles"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Society of Automotive Engineers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines an L4 autonomous car as one that doesn’t require human interaction in most cases and can only operate in limited areas. Companies like Waymo, Cruise, Motional, Pony.AI and Yandex are all using a similar combination of lidar, radar, cameras and GPS to build a vehicle brain that&#8217;s capable of L4 autonomy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shanghai&#8217;s fleet will be made up of Baidu&#8217;s electric Hongqi EVs, its fourth generation autonomous vehicles produced with FAW. The company did not disclose how many vehicles it has initially launched, but a Baidu spokesperson told TechCrunch that the goal is to make it to around 200 vehicles in Shanghai. In total, Baidu says it is either testing or publicly deploying about 500 AVs across 30 cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baidu does have a permit to test its driverless tech in California, it hasn&#8217;t yet deployed any service and is instead putting most of its resources towards scaling up in China. There’s a huge increase in demand for robotaxi services at home, says a company spokesperson, so Baidu is focusing on improving its technology, building lots of vehicles and ensuring a good user experience. Shanghai marks the fifth city where the Apollo Go robotaxi service is open to the public, including Changsha, Cangzhou, Beijing and Guangzhou. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, Baidu expanded its Apollo Go services in Beijing into the Tongzhou District, which is considered to be the eastern gateway into the city, adding 22 new stations over 31 miles. In April, the company launched 10 fully driverless robotaxis in the capital city’s Shougang Park, a 1.2 square mile area that has become the testing ground for China’s first commercialized robotaxi operations. No human safety operator sits behind the wheel of these cars, only a safety member in the passenger seat to provide riders with reassurance. Each ride costs 30 yuan ($4.60) and is open to passengers aged 18 to 60. Everywhere else, including Shanghai, rides are free because the service is still in its trial phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders in Shanghai can use the Apollo Go app to call a robotaxi from 9:30am to 11pm and be picked up or dropped off at one of 150 stations across the Jianding District, which is home to Shanghai University, the Shanghai International Circuit and many tourist attractions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shanghai is also the location of Baidu’s Apollo Park, an autonomous vehicle facility for operation, testing and R&amp;D. The 10,000 square meter space will house the 200 AVs Baidu hopes to bring to the city, which would make it the site of the largest self-driving fleet in East China. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu’s long game is to deploy 3,000 AVs in the next two to three years across 30 cities in China. Considering the company has been investing in R&amp;D for AV tech since 2013 and has been running the Apollo project since 2017, Baidu is poised to do just that. In June, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-and-baic-groups-arcfox-brand-collaborate-to-launch-apollo-moon-robotaxis-plan-mass-production-at-affordable-costs-301314427.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baidu and BAIC Group unveiled plans for the Apollo Moon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is set to be mass-produced with a per unit manufacturing price of 480,000 yuan, or about $75,000, which is actually pretty cheap, all things considered. Baidu says it will produce 1,000 of these vehicles over the next couple of years, as well as different models yet to be announced, in order to supply its growing fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure is a big part of Baidu’s goals to expand Apollo Go. A spokesperson from Baidu said the company is also investing in building 5G-powered, V2X infrastructure in hundreds of intersections throughout major Chinese cities. Baidu is already installing sensors like cameras and lidar, coupled with edge compute systems that can transfer road information to autonomous systems, in order to reduce traffic congestion. In the long term, smart infrastructure will help AVs perform more robustly and serve to offset some of the huge costs associated with onboard sensors and computing power, according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Baidu says its robotaxis currently still rely on onboard capabilities to achieve L4 autonomy, the company sees V2X as the future of large scale deployment. </span></p>
