<p>Despite this, investors have dreamed for years of the huge opportunities in unlocking Pakistan’s potential as a digital economy. As a country of 220 million people, almost two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, Pakistan draws natural comparisons to Indonesia &#8212; which has rapidly emerged as one of the most vibrant technology ecosystems outside the U.S. and China.</p>

<p>After years of lagging behind, over the course of the past 18 months, Pakistan’s technology ecosystem has come to life in unprecedented fashion. In 2021, Pakistani startups are on track to raise more money than the previous five years combined. Even more excitingly, a large portion of this capital is coming from international investors from across Asia, the Middle East and even famed investors from Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>The rapid emergence of Pakistan’s technology ecosystem on the international stage has been no accident &#8212; it’s the result of a confluence of changing facts on the ground and shifting dynamics in the startup and investing world as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Unlocking Pakistan’s potential</h2>
<p>The sudden emergence of Pakistan’s tech ecosystem on the international stage has been driven by three major factors: an improving security situation, quickly growing mobile connectivity, and critical legal changes and deregulation.</p>
<p>As a frontline state and coalition partner in the United States’ invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan saw <a href="https://www.satp.org/datasheet-terrorist-attack/fatalities/pakistan">fatalities from terrorist violence soar</a> from 295 in 2001 to a peak of over 11,000 in 2009. This climate of instability and violence scared away international business and investors from Pakistan for much of the first two decades of the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WellSaid Labs, whose tools create synthetic speech that could be mistaken for the real thing, has raised a $10M Series A to grow the business. The company&#8217;s home-baked text-to-speech engine works faster than real time and produces natural-sounding clips of pretty much any length, from quick snippets to hours-long readings.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/wellsaid-aims-to-make-natural-sounding-synthetic-speech-a-credible-alternative-to-real-humans/">WellSaid came out of the Allen Institute for AI incubator in 2019</a>, and its goal was to make synthetic voices that didn&#8217;t sound so robotic for common business purposes like training and marketing content.</p>
<p>It achieved that first by basing its solution on Tacotron, a speech engine developed by Google and academic researchers. But soon it had built its own that was more efficient, resulted in more convincing voices and could produce clips of arbitrary lengths. Speech engines often trip up after a couple sentences, descending into babble or losing tone, but WellSaid&#8217;s <a href="https://www.notion.so/Research-at-WellSaid-Labs-b2c40b2b7ab645e0b6d7beb3eef52b23">read the entirety of Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein&#8221; without a hiccup</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The voices were good enough that they were rated as human or as good as human by listeners — not something you could really say about the usual virtual assistant suspects when they speak more than a handful of words. Not only that, but the speech was generated considerably faster than real time, where other high-quality options often operated at a tenth real time or slower — meaning three minutes of speech would take one minute to generate by WellSaid and half an hour or more by Tacotron.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-2174302-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p>Lastly, the system allows for new &#8220;Voice Avatars&#8221; to be created based on existing voice talent, like a trusted company spokesperson or voiceover artist. Originally about 20 hours of audio was needed to build a model of their quirks and voice style, but now it can do so with as little as two hours, CEO Matt Hocking said.</p>
<p>The company is strictly business-focused right now, which is to say there&#8217;s no user-facing app to digitize your voice into an avatar or anything. There are attendant risks and no realistic business model for it, so that&#8217;s off the table for now.</p>
<p>Such a realistic voice might still be of enormous help to people with disabilities, however, something Hocking acknowledges but admits they&#8217;re not quite ready to tackle yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are committed to expanding access to this technology so that nonverbal communicators, nonprofits and others can benefit from it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime the company has expanded from its first market, corporate training videos, to marketing, longer copy, interactive products with considerable text and app experiences. One hopes that the talent these avatars are based on are being properly compensated for helping create a digital likeness of their voice.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed $10M round was led by FUSE, with participation from repeat investor Voyager, Qualcomm Ventures LLC and GoodFriends, all of whom were likely impressed by the product and business growth. Synthetic voices have served a handful of popular use cases but content has not been a big one — so there&#8217;s plenty of room to grow. The company will invest the money in deepening its product offering and growing the team along with it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European SPAC creation is modest compared to what’s been going on in the U.S, but it still represents material growth and a new avenue for European tech startups still hungry for exit opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. SPAC market kept rolling along this week with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">news that Satellogic will go public</a> on the Nasdaq stock exchange thanks to a merger with a blank check company. The Earth-imagery-focused company is standard SPAC fare, with strong capital needs and distant revenues. It was not alone in pursuing the transaction type Tuesday, with news breaking that Nextdoor will also go public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Nextdoor’s projections, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">TechCrunch noted</a>, were more modest and thus more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/spac-charts-are-exercises-in-the-limits-of-hype/">believable than what we’ve seen</a> from many other SPAC-led debuts.</p>
<p>These companies represent the two poles of blank-check-powered public offerings: Some startups taking the SPAC route are more speculative, banking on revenues to come, while others feature more established companies with a history of material revenue growth. It’s easy to find more examples of both varieties. Acorns’ deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/">fits the established trend.</a> Lidar SPACs? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">Less so</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given the breadth of companies pursuing blank-check deals, the SPAC boom isn’t over even if there has been chatter that the party is breaking up. Bessemer partner <a href="https://twitter.com/mcadonofrio">Mary D&#8217;Onofrio</a> told The Exchange, for example, that while the “pace of SPAC IPOs” and combinations have slowed, “there is still $128 billion of SPAC dry powder in the market seeking acquisitions and incentivized to transact.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph">Matt Murphy</a>, a partner at Menlo Ventures, helped explain the SPAC pace deceleration that D&#8217;Onofrio discussed, telling The Exchange that the pace of SPAC deals “has slowed as they’ve gotten more scrutiny and don’t seem quite as ‘easy’ as they once were.”</p>

But what about other regions? Unicorns are hardly unique to the U.S. startup ecosystem. Are we seeing similar SPAC interest in Europe?</p>
<p>The Exchange tried to find out, given that we’ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">huge rounds from the region</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/wise-ipo/update-1-wise-shares-indicated-to-open-at-10-bln-valuation-in-auction-idUSL5N2OJ1HJ">a few IPOs over various types.</a> Is the SPAC game afoot in Europe?</p>
<h2>Hunting European targets</h2>
<p>There’s a huge number of SPACs trading in the United States currently hunting for a deal. And there is historical precedent for U.S.-listed blank-check companies taking on European targets. Global law firm Skadden <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/02/spacs-reshaping-ma-and-ipos">counts 16</a> U.S. SPAC-led transactions with European companies from 2015 through February of this year, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past few weeks, we&#8217;ve been approached on a recurring basis, much like all known French and European scaleups,&#8221; Aircall&#8217;s co-founder Jonathan Anguelov <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/ecosysteme/spac-la-nouvelle-obsession-de-la-french-tech-1301577">told French financial newspaper Les Échos</a> last March (translation: TechCrunch). However, being approached doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that European unicorns are entertaining the offers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate venture capital used to get a bad rap. The money flowed from corporations into startups when times were good, and quickly disappeared when the market turned.</p>
<p>But startups and corporations discovered something over time: They&#8217;re a lot stronger together no matter the market conditions. Most big companies can&#8217;t gain enough insight into what&#8217;s bubbling up in the market without deep ties to founders; meanwhile, founders benefit greatly from having a renowned corporation on the balance sheet. Not only can a big brand give an upstart near-instant credibility, a corporate partner can also open doors and provide startups with a far better understanding about the needs of established companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because the corporate venture relationship has become so key to founders that we&#8217;re thrilled to be welcoming Arvind Purushotham to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage — Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> happening tomorrow, July 8-9. Purushotham is a longtime VC who started his career as a circuit designer with Intel before spending nearly a decade with Menlo Ventures. Then, in 2011, he helped found Citi&#8217;s corporate venture capital group, where he remains the outfit&#8217;s global head of venture investing and sets the group&#8217;s overall strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, having since partnered with all kinds of companies over this last decade with Citi  &#8212;  just some of its checks have gone to Square, DocuSign, Honey, Plaid, Betterment, Jet.com, DataRobot, Tanium, Pindrop and Digit &#8212; Purushotham knows what it takes to drive a business forward and how corporate VCs can help in the mission.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll share what his own team looks for when meeting with a founding team and how Citi specifically identifies, then invests in startups as a way to bring cutting-edge tech to Citi&#8217;s businesses and functions.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll also share what not to do and why, how much to reveal and when, and how to think about a corporate venture partner once that investment is made.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be one of the highlights of our event, which is coming up quickly and is a must-see if your startup or a startup that you&#8217;re advising is looking for insights into how to better approach the key pillars of both marketing and fundraising. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?display=true">Get your ticket today</a> before prices increase tonight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Pentagon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">killed the JEDI cloud program yesterday</a>, it was the end of a long and bitter road for a project that never seemed to have a chance. The question is why it didn&#8217;t work out in the end, and ultimately I think you can blame the DoD&#8217;s stubborn adherence to a single vendor requirement, a condition that never made sense to anyone, even the vendor that ostensibly won the deal.</p>
<p>In March 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/the-high-stakes-battle-for-the-pentagons-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/">the Pentagon announced</a> a mega <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">$10 billion, decade-long cloud contract</a> to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure for the Department of Defense. It was dubbed JEDI, which aside from the Star Wars reference, was short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.</p>
<p>The idea was a 10-year contract with a single vendor that started with an initial two-year option. If all was going well, a five-year option would kick in and finally a three-year option would close things out with earnings of $1 billion a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the total value of the contract had it been completed was quite large, a billion a year for companies the size of Amazon, Oracle or Microsoft is not a ton of money in the scheme of things. It was more about the prestige of winning such a high-profile contract and what it would mean for sales bragging rights. After all, if you passed muster with the DoD, you could probably handle just about anyone&#8217;s sensitive data, right?</p>
<p>Regardless, the idea of a single-vendor contract went against conventional wisdom that the cloud gives you the option of working with the best-in-class vendors. Microsoft, the eventual winner of the ill-fated deal acknowledged that the single vendor approach was flawed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/dod-clarifies-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/">in an interview in April 2018</a>:</p>
<p>Leigh Madden, who heads up Microsoft’s defense effort, says he believes Microsoft can win such a contract, but it isn’t necessarily the best approach for the DoD. “If the DoD goes with a single award path, we are in it to win, but having said that, it’s counter to what we are seeing across the globe where 80% of customers are adopting a multicloud solution,” Madden told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was doomed from the start because of that. Yet even before the requirements were fully known there were complaints that it would favor Amazon,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/cloud-infrastructure-market-keeps-rolling-in-q1-with-almost-40b-in-revenue/"> the market share leader</a> in the cloud infrastructure market. Oracle was particularly vocal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/oracle-s-catz-is-said-to-raise-amazon-contract-fight-with-trump">taking its complaints directly to the former president</a> before the RFP was even published. It would later file a complaint with the Government Accountability Office and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">file a couple of lawsuits</a> alleging that the entire process was unfair and designed to favor Amazon. It lost every time &#8212; and of course, Amazon wasn&#8217;t ultimately the winner.</p>

<p>While there was a lot of drama along the way, in April 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/much-to-oracles-chagrin-pentagon-names-microsoft-and-amazon-as-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-finalists/">the Pentagon named two finalists</a>, and it was probably not too surprising that they were the two cloud infrastructure market leaders: Microsoft and Amazon. Game on.</p>
<p>The former president <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/president-throws-latest-wrench-in-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-selection-process/">interjected himself directly in the process</a> in August that year, when he ordered the Defense Secretary to review the matter over concerns that the process favored Amazon, a complaint which to that point had been refuted several times over by the DoD, the Government Accountability Office and the courts. To further complicate matters, a book by former defense secretary Jim Mattis claimed the president told him to &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/26/trump-mattis-screw-amazon-10-billion-pentagon-cloud-contract-jedi.html">screw Amazon out of the $10 billion contract</a>.&#8221; His goal appeared to be to get back at Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper.</p>
<p>In spite of all these claims that the process favored Amazon, when the winner was finally announced in October 2019, late on a Friday afternoon no less, the winner was not in fact Amazon. Instead,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/"> Microsoft won the deal</a>, or at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/even-after-microsoft-wins-jedi-saga-could-drag-on/">it seemed that way</a>. It wouldn&#8217;t be long before Amazon would dispute the decision in court.</p>

<p>By the time AWS re:Invent hit a couple of months after the announcement, former AWS CEO Andy Jassy was already pushing the idea that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/amazon-wants-to-depose-president-and-secretary-of-defense-as-part-of-jedi-protest/">the president had unduly influenced the process</a>.</p>
<p>“I think that we ended up with a situation where there was political interference. When you have a sitting president, who has shared openly his disdain for a company, and the leader of that company, it makes it really difficult for government agencies, including the DoD, to make objective decisions without fear of reprisal,” Jassy said at that time.</p>
<p>Then came the litigation. In November the company indicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/aws-confirms-reports-it-will-challenge-jedi-contract-award-to-microsoft/">it would be challenging the decision</a> to choose Microsoft charging that it was was driven by politics and not technical merit. In January 2020, Amazon filed a request with the court that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/in-latest-jedi-contract-drama-aws-files-motion-to-stop-work-on-project/">the project should stop</a> until the legal challenges were settled. In February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">a federal judge agreed</a> with Amazon and stopped the project. It would never restart.</p>
<p>In April the DoD completed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/dod-inspector-general-report-finds-everything-was-basically-hunky-dory-with-jedi-cloud-contract-bid/">its own internal investigation</a> of the contract procurement process and found no wrongdoing. As I wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>While controversy has dogged the $10-billion, decade-long JEDI contract since its earliest days, a report by the DoD’s inspector general’s office concluded today that, while there were some funky bits and potential conflicts, overall the contract procurement process was fair and legal and the president did not unduly influence the process in spite of public comments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last September the DoD completed a review of the selection process and it once <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/dod-reaffirms-microsoft-has-won-jedi-cloud-contract-but-amazon-legal-complaints-still-pending/">again concluded that Microsoft was the winner</a>, but it didn&#8217;t really matter as the litigation was still in motion and the project remained stalled.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S0eQ7afnpw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">Judge temporarily halts work on JEDI contract until court can hear AWS protest</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Judge temporarily halts work on JEDI contract until court can hear AWS protest&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/embed/#?secret=S0eQ7afnpw" data-secret="S0eQ7afnpw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The legal wrangling continued into this year, and yesterday the Pentagon finally pulled the plug on the project once and for all, saying it was time to move on as times have changed since 2018 when it announced its vision for JEDI.</p>
<p>The DoD finally came to the conclusion that a single-vendor approach wasn&#8217;t the best way to go, and not because it could never get the project off the ground, but because it makes more sense from a technology and business perspective to work with multiple vendors and not get locked into any particular one.</p>
<p>“JEDI was developed at a time when the Department’s needs were different and both the CSPs&#8217; (cloud service providers) technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature. In light of new initiatives like <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF11493.pdf">JADC2</a> (the Pentagon&#8217;s initiative to build a network of connected sensors) and AI and Data Acceleration (ADA), the evolution of the cloud ecosystem within DoD, and changes in user requirements to leverage multiple cloud environments to execute mission, our landscape has advanced and a new way ahead is warranted to achieve dominance in both traditional and nontraditional warfighting domains,” said John Sherman, acting DoD chief information officer in a statement.</p>
<p>In other words, the DoD would benefit more from adopting a multicloud, multivendor approach like pretty much the rest of the world. That said, the department also indicated it would limit the vendor selection to Microsoft and Amazon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department intends to seek proposals from a limited number of sources, namely the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as available market research indicates that these two vendors are the only Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) capable of meeting the Department’s requirements,&#8221; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not going to sit well with Google, Oracle or IBM, but the department further indicated it would continue to monitor the market to see if other CSPs had the chops to handle their requirements in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, the single vendor requirement contributed greatly to an overly competitive and politically charged atmosphere that resulted in the project never coming to fruition. Now the DoD has to play technology catch-up, having lost three years to the histrionics of the entire JEDI procurement process and that could be the most lamentable part of this long, sordid technology tale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In his first press event since ignominiously leaving office earlier this year, former President Donald Trump announced that he is launching a volley of class action lawsuits against Twitter, Facebook, Google and their CEOs, claiming that the three companies violated his First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well,&#8221; Trump said at the press conference, held at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club.</p>
<p>Following the January 6 attack on the Capitol, social media platforms swiftly revoked then President Trump&#8217;s posting privileges. For years, Trump tested the boundaries of platforms&#8217; policies around misinformation and even violent threats, but his role in the events of that day crossed a line. Trump soon found himself without a megaphone with which to reach his many millions of followers across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trump&#8217;s fate on Twitter is known: the former president faces a lifetime ban there. But on Facebook and YouTube, there&#8217;s a possibility that his accounts could be restored. Facebook is still deliberating that decision after its external policy making body, the Facebook Oversight Board, kicked the issue back to the company. Facebook now needs to determine the length of Trump&#8217;s indefinite suspension, whether permanent or for a fixed period of time.</p>
<p>Trump will be the lead plaintiff in the suits, which are being filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuits seek &#8220;compensatory and punitive damages&#8221; and the restoration of Trump&#8217;s social media accounts. Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the news and Google did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>The lawsuits have already had their intended effect of generating attention, but they aren&#8217;t likely to go anywhere. Trump accuses Facebook, Twitter and Google of violating his First Amendment rights, but the First Amendment pertains to governments censoring free speech, not businesses.</p>
<p>The three companies are also well-guarded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which both protects platforms from legal liability for the content they host and empowers them to make content moderation decisions — including the decision to remove a sitting president from their platforms altogether.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://r2c.dev/">r2c</a>, a startup building a SaaS service around the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/">Semgrep open-source project</a>, announced that it has closed a $27 million Series B. Felicis led the round, which the company said was a pre-emptive deal.</p>
<p>Prior investors firms Redpoint and Sequoia also participated in the fundraising event; r2c last <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/r2c/company_financials">raised a $13 million Series A</a> in October of 2020.</p>
<p>The startup fits into several trends that TechCrunch has explored in recent quarters, including what appears to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">growing number</a> of open-source (OSS) grounded startups raising capital, more rounds coming to exist thanks to investors looking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">to get the jump on inside rounds</a> before they can form.</p>
<p>On the OSS point, r2c works with Semgrep, which the company likens to a &#8220;code-aware grep.&#8221; Still confused? Don&#8217;t worry, this is all a bit technical, but interesting. Grep is a tool for searching through plain-text that has been around for decades. Semgrep is related, but focused on finding things inside of written code.</p>
<p>Given the sheer volume of code that is written daily in the world, you can imagine that there is an ever-rising demand for finding particular bits of text quickly; Semgrep is an evolution of the original project, that was initially built inside of Facebook.</p>
<p>Per r2c CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacevans">Isaac Evans</a>, however, the project failed to attract much awareness. His startup has built what Evans described to TechCrunch has the &#8220;canonical&#8221; Semgrep fork, or version, and has crafted a software service around the code to make it easier for other companies to use.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174593" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174593" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174593 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="152" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg 3360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=2048,1035 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174593" class="wp-caption-text">The r2c team, via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>There are many ways to generate revenue from open-source software. Two popular monetization routes are througuh support services or offers to host particular projects. But, R2c is a doing something a bit different. The startup sells a monthly, per-developer subscription (SaaS) that packages a broad set of security-focused rules across different coding languages, allowing companies to easily check their own software for possible security issues.</p>
<p>Or as Evans succinctly explained it, r2c offers something akin to application security in a box.</p>
<p>Focusing on cybersecurity is a reasonable tack for the company. Given the ever-growing number of breaches that the public endures, helping companies leak less data, and suffer fewer intrusions is big business.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to pay r2c, however. Semgrep is OSS and the rules associated with various languages are available under a LGPL license &#8212; more on that definition <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">here</a>. Developers could build their own version of what the company offers. But, Evans argued, it won&#8217;t be ready to help you pick which rules you may want to apply to your code, something that his company is happy to help with for a fee.</p>
<p>From a wide lens, r2c fits into the developer tools category. It is content to land and expand inside of companies, perhaps allowing it a lower cost of acquiring customers than we see at some SaaS startups. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the company won&#8217;t go to market to sell its service. Per Evans, the startup has historically underinvested in marketing, something that it may now be able to focus more on thanks to its recent financing.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see companies with technically-minded founders initially spend too little on the sales and marketing parts of operating a software business. But our impression after discussing the company&#8217;s plans with Evans is that r2c intends to get that part of its house in order.</p>
<p>Evans told TechCrunch that his company took aboard more cash because it doesn&#8217;t want to build the best search tool for, say, the C programming language. It wants to go broad, fusing what the CEO described as the &#8220;customizability of Semgrep&#8221; and wide language support.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how quickly the company can staff up, bolster its marketing efforts, and take on enterprise clients. Raising a Series C puts the company somewhere past its startup adolescence, so from here on out we can pester the company for concrete growth numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re a frequent TechCrunch reader, you probably already know about mmhmm, the startup with the name you likely either love or hate. It&#8217;s Phil Libin&#8217;s second act after Evernote, and it&#8217;s a startup born of the pandemic maybe more so than any other, providing improved video chat tools, including automatic background removal and advanced presentation features. The company, which is just over a year old, has now raised a total of around $140 million thanks to a fresh injection of $100 million first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/a-company-called-mmhmm-just-raised-100-million">reported by Bloomberg</a> on Tuesday, which is somewhat astounding if you remember using the first early beta versions like me.</p>
<p>Startups with silly names raising lots of money is hardly an exceptional occurrence in tech, but Libin&#8217;s startup earns extra credit for barely having a name at all (it&#8217;s really just a sound).</p>
<p>The company was built on the idea that current video tools really fail to provide users with access to all the potential that modern technology offers, particularly when it comes to presentations. Mmhmm&#8217;s core presenter tools help your meetings look more like professional newscasts than warmed-over digital versions of transparency slideshows and whiteboard scrawls, and the company has steadily been adding features and improving its performance through frequent iterations since its founding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xtp8BYcoZu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/mmhmm-the-video-conferencing-software-kicks-off-summer-with-a-bunch-of-new-features/">mmhmm, the video conferencing software, kicks off summer with a bunch of new features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;mmhmm, the video conferencing software, kicks off summer with a bunch of new features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/mmhmm-the-video-conferencing-software-kicks-off-summer-with-a-bunch-of-new-features/embed/#?secret=xtp8BYcoZu" data-secret="xtp8BYcoZu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As it stands, mmhmm works in tandem with the existing video services that people use for virtual meetings, including Zoom. But Bloomberg says it&#8217;s going to go standalone as well, and introduce a mobile app version. That sounds like a good use of the new funds, which come from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital and more.</p>
<p>Even projecting forward to a post-pandemic world where virtual meetings are less important, they&#8217;re probably still a permanent part of the working world. But mmhmm&#8217;s feature set also seems to almost define the concept of &#8216;feature, not product&#8217; that is presented as a cautionary tale to startups crafting wings of wax and soaring as high as they can in terms of raises and valuation.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie, </strong></p>
<p><strong>I co-founded a startup a few years ago and currently have an O-1A visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My wife wants to return to work, but as you know, she cannot get work authorization on an O-3. I read that if I switch to International Entrepreneur Parole, she can get work authorization. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the process for getting Entrepreneur Parole and for my wife to get a work permit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Supportive Spouse in San Jose</strong></p>
<p>Dear Supportive,</p>
<p>I’m so excited by all the opportunities opening up thanks to the revived <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) program. It would be awesome if your wife could resume her career!</p>
<p>Take a listen to my podcast on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/078-parole-entry-process/">the parole entry process</a>, what you have to do to get it and what to expect when you do, including when your wife can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Tomorrow, I’ll be participating in a <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_IbfeMbSuQpG_smh3ijzfWg">free educational panel hosted by the National Venture Capital Association with representatives of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> that you’re welcome to join as well.</p>
<p>Although this IEP has been around for more than four years, the Department of Homeland Security only recently revived it after the Trump administration tried and failed to get rid of it. Given that the IEP program is so new, I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney when applying for IEP. An immigration attorney can also discuss other options that would allow your wife to work.</p>
<h2>How do I apply for Entrepreneur Parole?</h2>
<p>You must fill out the application for Entrepreneur Parole and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) along with evidence that demonstrates your rapidly growing startup will create jobs and significantly contribute to the U.S. economy. If you want more details on the qualification requirements for IEP, take a look at a previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">Dear Sophie column</a> on that topic or listen to my podcast, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole is back!</a> To get parole for your spouse and children (under the age of 21 and unmarried), you can concurrently file their applications for Advance Parole.</p>
<p>If USCIS approves your application for IEP, you will receive a parole document that is valid for 30 months, supports multiple entries and can be extended once for another 30 months if you and your startup continue to meet the extension criteria. However, USCIS approval alone does not grant you or your family parole.</p>
<h2>Who grants parole?</h2>
<p>A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officer at an airport or other U.S. port of entry will have the final say on whether you and your family are granted parole — a temporary stay in the U.S. — and for how long. There is no equivalent of a “change of status” here.</p>
<p>That means if you and your family are in the U.S., you must first leave the U.S. and then show your parole documents to the CBP officer upon reentering the U.S. The CBP officer has the discretion to approve or deny your entry, so your immigration attorney should prepare you by letting you know the type of questions you may be asked and how to succinctly and honestly answer them.</p>
<p>If you and your wife are returning to the U.S. via airplane or boat, you will need to go to a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain a boarding foil. That foil — also known as a travel foil — will enable you to board an airplane or boat since you won&#8217;t have a visa stamp in your passport under IEP.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Canadian nationals traveling from Canada to a U.S. port of entry can present an approved parole document without obtaining travel documentation. I believe individuals are allowed to enter the land border from Mexico, which some of our clients will be testing. (More updates to come!)</p>
<p>Although IEP allows for an initial stay in the U.S. of up to 30 months, CBP officers could approve your parole into the U.S. for only one year, requiring you to exit and reenter the U.S. again in 12 months. The CBP officer will stamp your passport with your parole expiration date.</p>
<p>To renew parole beyond the initial 30 months for another 30 months, you will have to meet the IEP extension requirements and file a new Entrepreneur Parole application.</p>
<h2>How does my spouse get an EAD?</h2>
<p>Once you and your wife are paroled into the U.S., she can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), otherwise known as a work permit. Your wife cannot begin working until she receives the EAD, and it will only be valid for the length of the parole stay. Given the current USCIS processing delays, the EAD may only be valid for a few months before your wife has to apply for a new EAD.</p>
<p>Depending on your wife’s field of expertise, it may make more sense for her to find a job with an employer willing to sponsor her for a visa or green card. Given the tight labor market in some industry sectors in the U.S., many employers are increasingly willing to invest in international talent.</p>
<p>Or, if you both want to remain in the U.S. permanently, you can also consider self-petitioning for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability</a> or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals with exceptional ability</a>. Your immigration attorney should be able to help you determine which immigration option is right for you and your wife.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you and your wife as you navigate this process to live your dreams!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.unit21.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities with its no-code software, announced today it has raised $34 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round values San Francisco-based Unit21 at $300 million and comes nine months after the startup raised a $13 million Series A that included investments from the founders of Plaid, Chime and Shape Security as well as former Venmo COO Michael Vaughan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICONIQ Capital and existing backers Gradient Ventures (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s AI venture fund)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, A.Capital and South Park Commons participated in the latest funding event. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ormer Affirm product manager Trisha Kothari and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">larence Chio founded Unit21 in 2018 with the goal of giving risk, compliance and fraud teams a way to fight financial crime via a “secure, integrated, no-code platform.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174139" style="width: 348px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174139" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2174139 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="338" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg 3721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unit21</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say they started Unit21 based on the belief that the existing model of “black box” machine learning used for fraud prevention and detection was flawed. Their idea was to develop an alternative system to provide risk and compliance teams with more control over their operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21 describes its core technology as a “flag-and-review” toolset designed to give non-technical operators and <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/us-and-uk-regulators-take-lead-on-aml-fines-for-2019/">anti-money laundering (AML) teams</a> the ability to “easily” write complex statistical models and deploy customized workflows without having to involve their engineering teams. Unit21 says it provides this toolset to companies with the aim of helping them mitigate fraud and money laundering risks through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, transaction monitoring detection and suspicious activity report (SAR) case management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21 has built up an impressive customer base of over 50 enterprise clients, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chime, Intuit, Coinbase, Gusto, Flywire, Wyre and Twitter, among others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company says it has monitored more than $100 billion in activity via its API and dashboard since its 2018 inception. It also says that it has saved more than 20 million users over $100 million in fraud loss/suspicious activity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only revenue grew by “12x” in 2020 compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data is the most important weapon in the fight against fraud and money laundering,” Kothari said. “This funding will support our mission to democratize data and make it more accessible to operations teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use its new capital in part toward expanding its engineering, research and development and go-to-market  teams. As of late June, Unit21 had 53 employees, up from 12 at the same time last year. The startup also plans to evolve its platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for generalized flag and review use cases beyond financial crimes and fraud. It’s also eyeing expansion in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe/Middle East (EMEA) markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Partner John Curtius said Unit21 is transforming organizations’ ability to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyze data to its advantage for risk management and compliance.”</span></p>
<p>The space is a hot one with a number of other fraud-prevention companies raising capital in recent months, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">Sift</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/fraud-prevention-platform-seon-raises-a-12m-series-a-round-led-by-creandum/">Seon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/feedzai-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-ai-tools-to-fight-financial-fraud/">Feedzai</a>. According to<a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/surveys-and-benchmarking/report-fines-against-financial-institutions-hit-104b-in-2020/29869.article"> Compliance Week</a> (citing analysis by Fenergo), f<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">inancial institutions were hit with an estimated $10.4 billion in global fines and penalties related to anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), data privacy, and MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) regulations in 2020, bringing the total to $46.4 billion for those types of breaches since 2008.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.fenergo.com/press-releases/global-financial-institution-fines-for-aml-data-privacy-and-mifid-rise-26-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, spanning up to its release date of Dec. 9, said there have been 198 fines against financial institutions for AML, KYC, data privacy, and MiFID deficiencies, representing a 141% increase since 2019.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://opaque.co/">Opaque</a>, a new startup born out of Berkeley&#8217;s <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISELab</a>, announced a $9.5 million seed round today to build a solution to access and work with sensitive data in the cloud in a secure way, even with multiple organizations involved. Intel Capital led today&#8217;s investment with participation by Race Capital, The House Fund and FactoryHQ.</p>
<p>The company helps customers work with secure data in the cloud while making sure the data they are working on is not being exposed to cloud providers, other research participants or anyone else, says company president Raluca Ada Popa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is we use this very exciting hardware mechanism called Enclave, which [operates] deep down in the processor &#8212; it&#8217;s a physical black box &#8212; and only gets decrypted there. [&#8230;] So even if somebody has administrative privileges in the cloud, they can only see encrypted data,&#8221; she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder Ion Stoica, who was a co-founder at Databricks, says the startup&#8217;s solution helps resolve two conflicting trends. On one hand, businesses increasingly want to make use of data, but at the same time are seeing a growing trend toward privacy. Opaque is designed to resolve this by giving customers access to their data in a safe and fully encrypted way.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=H7qbQvLiw9" data-secret="H7qbQvLiw9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company describes the solution as &#8220;a novel combination of two key technologies layered on top of state-of-the-art cloud security—secure hardware enclaves and cryptographic fortification.&#8221; This enables customers to work with data &#8212; for example to build machine learning models &#8212; without exposing the data to others, yet while generating meaningful results.</p>
<p>Popa says this could be helpful for hospitals working together on cancer research, who want to find better treatment options without exposing a given hospital&#8217;s patient data to other hospitals, or banks looking for money laundering without exposing customer data to other banks, as a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Investors were likely attracted to the pedigree of Popa, a computer security and applied crypto professor at UC Berkeley and Stoica, who is also a Berkeley professor and co-founded Databricks. Both helped found RISELabs at Berkeley where they developed the solution and spun it out as a company.</p>
<p>Mark Rostick, vice president and senior managing director at lead investor Intel Capital says his firm has been working with the founders since the startup&#8217;s earliest days, recognizing the potential of this solution to help companies find complex solutions even when there are multiple organizations involved sharing sensitive data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises struggle to find value in data across silos due to confidentiality and other concerns. Confidential computing unlocks the full potential of data by allowing organizations to extract insights from sensitive data while also seamlessly moving data to the cloud without compromising security or privacy,” Rostick said in a statement</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Opaque bridges the gap between data security and cloud scale and economics, thus enabling inter-organizational and intra-organizational collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> aims to fix the problem with superficial dating apps, where users primarily make decisions based on how someone looks in their photos. Instead of swiping through profiles, SwoonMe&#8217;s idea is to use a combination of avatars and audio to encourage users to connect based on someone&#8217;s personality, not their appearance.</p>
<p>To use the app, you take a selfie which SwoonMe converts into an avatar. This is what others will see when they come to your profile. You then record a voice clip to tell others about yourself and what you&#8217;re looking for in a partner. You&#8217;ll also answer a few questions &#8212; like whether you&#8217;re looking for marriage or something more casual and what your <a href="https://www.5lovelanguages.com/">love language</a> is (e.g. physical touch, gifts, words of affirmation, etc.), among other things.</p>
<p>The result is that when people scroll through SwoonMe, they&#8217;re not making snap decisions based on what they&#8217;re seeing, but are rather making more thoughtful decisions based what they hear. When two people match, the app encourages them to continue to get to know each other using voice messages and soon, icebreaker games &#8212; not texting and photo-sharing. As they communicate, their avatar will slowly unveil their real photo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173606" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173606" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173606" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SwoonMe</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for SwoonMe comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvigupta773/">Tanvi Gupta</a>, a former Facebook product specialist who was involved with a number of high-profile products, including those that shipped in Messenger and in Instagram Direct, such as Messenger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/facebook-messenger-reactions/">reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/facebook-messenger-simple-redesign/">a Messenger redesign</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/chat-heads-comes-to-facebook-messenger-for-android-works-across-apps-even-without-facebook-home/">chat heads</a> on Android, and more. This experience taught her a lot about launching new products built from scratch, and helping them to find product-market fit, she says.</p>
<p>But Gupta decided to build SwoonMe because of her own personal struggles with modern-day dating apps, where men who messaged her immediately wanted to share selfies and meet her without having read anything on her profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dating world always felt super-indexed on looks, given the proliferation of apps like Tinder and Bumble,&#8221; Gupta explains. &#8220;And what I felt was they were not solving my personal need for somebody who wants to connect for a long-term relationship,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Gupta began work on SwoonMe during the pandemic, when the market was hungry for new ways to connect people online &#8212; a trend that had led to the launch of audio apps like Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">and</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">later</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">its</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">many</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">clones</a>. The founder says she was also inspired by Clubhouse, as it demonstrated the potential in audio-based social networking, including how it could be used for more personal connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms like Clubhouse have shown that taking video and looks out of the equation allow people to lean into actual topics,&#8221; Gupta says. &#8220;It creates new levels of intimacy and interaction, and we&#8217;re basically trying to capture this with SwoonMe, but in the dating world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though SwoonMe isn&#8217;t necessarily limited only to people looking for relationships, it may initially appeal to that demographic because it requires a bit more time and focus to listen to soundbites and engage in audio-based messaging. This experience would be more likely to attract someone who is taking dating more seriously, not someone in search of a quick hookup or causal connection.</p>

<p>SwoonMe is not the first social app to use avatars instead of photos, however. Avatar-based social discovery apps have been popular in other markets in Asia and in Brazil, but have yet to see broad, mainstream adoption in the U.S., particularly in the dating market. That may soon change, though, as Tinder parent Match Group this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Seoul-based social app maker Hyperconnect</a> — its biggest acquisition ever at $1.73 billion. AR-powered avatars are a part of the app portfolio that came with the deal.</p>
<p>The startup is also not the first dating app to take the idea of the &#8220;face reveal&#8221; &#8212; a somewhat gimmicky <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-doing-a-face-reveal">concept</a> popularized by online creators &#8212; into the world of dating. There are a number of voice-based apps on the app stores today, which have seen varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>In February, for example, an app called Jigsaw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">raised</a> $3.7 million for its own so-called &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating app that places puzzle pieces over users&#8217; faces which can only be removed after a pre-set amount of in-app engagement. But in Jigsaw&#8217;s case, the puzzle pieces were to be applied over full body photos, and it had banned selfies. That means the app was doing the opposite of what it proposes. Instead of encouraging daters to ignore images, some users were likely making decisions based on what someone&#8217;s <em>body</em> looked like in their photo with their face <em>removed</em>. That&#8217;s even worse. (After expressing my concerns to Jigsaw and declining to cover them, the startup told me it ended its selfie ban and now accepts a wide range of imagery.)</p>
<p>Gupta also feels strongly that women, in particular, deserve a different way to meet people that&#8217;s not about their looks alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a female, one of the main drivers behind founding a company like SwoonMe, which is audio-first and not photos, is because I personally am tired, and have been tired, of being objectified by men&#8230;We&#8217;re living in the 21st century and I am done with that. I want someone to like me because of my personality, because of my voice, because of what I bring into a relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Sure, physical attraction is important, but that is not the only thing,&#8221; Gupta adds.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there&#8217;s demand for a less superficial dating app from men, too. In fact, SwoonMe currently has more male users than female at present. The app, to be clear, is open to all gender identities and sexual orientations as the issues it aims to solve can impact everyone. It also offers an inclusive sign-up flow.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s too soon to report user numbers and growth, Gupta says the app has &#8220;a good number&#8221; of early testers and they&#8217;ve been able to get solid user feedback so far.</p>
<p>The bigger question for SwoonMe is whether or not it can attract people looking for real relationships, as many of those people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-date-without-dating-apps-2018-10">avoid dating apps</a> altogether. It&#8217;s also competing with a growing number of video-first dating apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">like Snack</a>, aimed at Gen Z users who are more comfortable filming themselves thanks to their use of social media platforms like TikTok.</p>
<p>At launch, <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> doesn&#8217;t generate revenue, but plans to add premium features if it reaches scale. Longer-term, the company would like to expand its platform beyond dating to help keep couples connected during their relationship, too.</p>
<p>SwoonMe soft-launched across both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swoonme-voice-first-dating/id1552773407">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dalybyteinc.swoonme">Play Store</a> for beta testing, but is today announcing its official launch. Currently, SwoonMe is targeting the dating markets of San Francisco and L.A., but is open to anyone who wants to try it.</p>
<p>The startup is a small team and currently working to raise $1 million in seed funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tighten your bootstraps and get ready to wring every last ounce of education and opportunity out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>. Our two-day deep dive into the essential skills every early-stage founder needs to build a stronger startup begins tomorrow!</p>
<p>Hold the proverbial phone. You still have time (though not much) to avoid paying more at the “door.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>today, July 7, before 11:59 pm (PT)</strong> and you’ll save $100.</p>
<p>We have a program-packed day tomorrow, and here’s a preview of just some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">the experts</a> on hand and the topics they’ll cover. Check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a> to plan your day, and don’t fret about schedule conflicts. Your pass includes video-on-demand, so you won’t miss a moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Times listed in the agenda will automatically adjust to your geographic location.</p>
<p><strong>How to Line Up Your Growth with Your Goals:</strong> Unlike giant brands, startups need to use their marketing spend wisely and efficiently. Sound Ventures’ Susan Su is a growth marketing expert and will share how to define growth based on your startup’s goals, and how to take a framework-based approach to growth, rather than relying on old playbooks that aren’t relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Product Market Fit is All About Tempo:</strong> Sequoia’s Mike Vernal understands that the most successful companies are not necessarily the ones with a great idea, but the ability to learn from their customers and adapt quickly. Hear this seasoned venture partner explain how customer feedback loops, product iteration tempo and mindset not only affect fundraising, but the overall trajectory of the company.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get Ready to Fundraise: </strong>The process of fundraising doesn’t start with your first meeting. Setting a timeline, preparing your deck, warming up investors and understanding your strengths are key to a successful fundraise, and need to happen well before you start filling up your calendar. Cleo Capital founding partner Sarah Kunst will outline how to get ready to fundraise and answer your most burning questions.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about our other breakout sessions. You’ll hear from folks at SeedInvest, Dell for Entrepreneurs, UserTesting, Movile, Pilot and oVice. Plus, we built time for networking right into the schedule.</p>
<p>Are you ready to take what you know to the next level? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>, day one, starts tomorrow, and we can’t wait to see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscriptions have become a popular way to pay for digital services, like Netflix or Spotify, but they haven&#8217;t yet taken off as a means of reordering your everyday items or other household essentials. Retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=15283820011">Amazon</a>, have tried shifting consumers to a subscription model for these sorts of purchases &#8212; even by offering discounts. Still, consumers have largely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-consumer-internet-subscriptions-focus/consumer-giants-spurn-risks-to-chase-online-subscribers-idUSKCN1PC00H">balked at the idea</a> of forced reordering on a fixed schedule. A startup called <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/">Repeat</a> believes it may have figured out a better solution. Instead of trying to lock consumers into subscriptions, Repeat analyzes consumer purchase behavior to nudge customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder. It then provides them with a personalized shopping cart to make the reordering experience fast and painless.</p>
<p>This service is now being used by 67 companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market, including brands like By Humankind (personal care), Jot (coffee), Vegamour (haircare), Youth to the People (skincare), Osea (skincare), hydrant (rapid hydration packets), Twice (toothpaste), lemon perfect (flavored water), and many others.</p>
<p>Today, Repeat is announcing its $6 million Series A, led by Battery Ventures. Seed investors Mucker Capital and Harlem Capital also invested in the round. With the round&#8217;s close, Battery&#8217;s general partner <a href="https://www.battery.com/people/neeraj-agrawal/">Neeraj Agrawal</a>, whose background is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">enterprise software-as-a-service</a> businesses, is joining Repeat&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>The idea to tackle e-commerce&#8217;s replenishment problem came about after Repeat&#8217;s co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimstiefel/">Kim Stiefel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahwissel/">Sarah Wissel</a> tried launching their own direct-to-consumer apparel brand, UNDR, focused on refreshing the basics &#8212; like socks, tees, and underwear. Having spend their careers in the marketing and ad tech world, they believed they would be able to put their experience to work to grow their new business.</p>
<p>After launching a quarterly subscription for t-shirts, the founders soon discovered not only how hard it was to get a brand-new brand off the ground, but also how getting customers to commit to ongoing purchases was even harder. From their customer feedback, the founders learned that most consumers actually don&#8217;t like the experience of reordering household items. Customers told them it doesn&#8217;t always make sense to reorder products on a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>Unlike Netflix, where you&#8217;re paying for the rights to access a broad catalog on an ongoing basis, there are times when you&#8217;ll use your household products more quickly or more slowly. That means you&#8217;ll sometimes end up receiving items too soon when you&#8217;ve ordered them on subscription. That&#8217;s not ideal; nor is it very eco-friendly. Other times, you may run out before your scheduled delivery is due to arrive. That&#8217;s also a problem.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We should have known that,&#8221; admits Stiefel, now Repeat&#8217;s CEO, after hearing that customers didn&#8217;t like subscriptions. &#8220;We asked ourselves if we actually subscribe to any products, and it turns out, the answer was &#8216;no.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The founders decided to scrap their subscription in favor of a new idea. Instead of forcing consumers to subscribe on a schedule, they would &#8220;nudge&#8221; customers to reorder during what they determined would would be the perfect window, based on past order history.</p>

<p>After experimenting with personalized reminders for their own brand for a year, Stiefel and Wissel decided to pivot their startup so they could offer this service to any e-commerce CPG company.</p>
<p>Today, any brand that sells a replenishable or consumable product can use Repeat to turn their one-time buyer into a repeat customer. To do so, Repeat uses a combination of logic, where it analyzes all the company&#8217;s a la carte purchase behavior to make sense of the general replenishment intervals on a per-SKU basis. It then leverages that logic to nudge customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder by sending an <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/klaviyo-replenishment-flows">email</a> or <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/sms">text</a> with a link to what Repeat calls its &#8220;replenishment cart.&#8221; The customer can choose to snooze the reminder or they can click through to checkout.</p>
<p>This replenishment cart is a special shopping cart that&#8217;s personalized to the individual customer and pre-filled with the product or products they&#8217;re due to repurchase, as well as other suggestions. But unlike a typical checkout experience, the customer can adjust the merchandise the cart contains &#8212; for example, by opting for a different flavor or scent for their product, or opting for a larger size, among other things.</p>
<p>As the customer continues to interact with Repeat&#8217;s reminders and cart, the service gets smarter about understanding that customer&#8217;s unique reordering intervals, so its nudges also get smarter. In time, Repeat envisions offering a universal cart where customers can reorder from across their favorite CPG brands in one place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174542" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174542" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2174542" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Repeat</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of logic that goes into making that cart experience work as well as it does,&#8221; notes Stiefel. &#8220;For example, the cart converts at around 25 percent on average. Some brands are seeing 40, or 45 percent conversion on that cart, and we see that people check out oftentimes in less than 15 seconds on that cart. And I think that&#8217;s really the underlying magic &#8212; that, in combination with the logic, is the underlying magic of Repeat,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the challenge of getting its nudges exactly right. If Repeat hits up customers at the wrong time, it could be perceived as an annoyance and customers might opt out of the notifications.</p>
<p>Repeat currently generates revenue through a monthly SaaS (software-as-a-subscription) fee, and as a percentage of the revenue its cart drives. For brands that drive less than 2,000 a la carte, non-subscription orders per month, Repeat would charge $99 per month plus 5% of the revenue it drives. And for brands that are driving more than 10,000 a la carte, non-subscriptions orders per month, Repeat charges $499 per month, plus 5% of the revenue it drives. The company isn&#8217;t disclosing its own revenue figures, however.</p>
<p>L.A.-based Repeat says it plans to use the new funds to hire across all roles, including in engineering, product, sales, marketing and growth. The startup began the year with just 3 employees, but hopes to be at around 15 to 20 by the end of the year by expanding its team that&#8217;s distributed across the U.S.</p>
<p>The company will also use the capital to work on scaling the business. For example, it recently launched <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/qr-codes">QR codes</a> that allow anyone to be redirected to a Repeat cart &#8212; even first-time shoppers who discover a brand through a friend, and scan the product to order one of their own.</p>
<p>Over time, Repeat believes it can change the way CPG subscriptions work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with subscription today is that it&#8217;s fixed, and time-based and rigid, and not rooted in any kind of real consumption cadence,&#8221; says Stiefel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Repeat focuses on that all a carte reordering experience, and because we&#8217;re looking at repeat behavior across individual product SKUs, we actually know a tremendous amount about consumption behavior across every category of CPG. I think what you&#8217;ll see from us in the future is being able to leverage that data to offer more flexible dynamic subscription experiences,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> decided that it was time to talk about drugs. No, not like <em>drugs for fun, </em>but instead drugs that you might have <em>considered</em> fun, but are now being redirected to help bolster your health.</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s our theme today. As it turns out, there are a number of startups and even nascently public companies that are pursing using drugs that we might consider recreational for serious health purposes. Which is neat, as our habit of decrying any drug that makes you feel better as immoral has likely held us back from learning quite a lot about them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Venture capital investment in psychedelic start-ups, per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a>, rose from sub-$100 million results in 2018 and 2019 to $346 million last year.</li>
<li>Vice clauses, however, can pause a legitimate issue for investors who might want to cut a check in the space.</li>
<li>From the startup angle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/nue-life-health-raises-3-3m-for-its-psychedelics-meets-tech-mental-wellness-platform/">NUE Life Health recently raised $3.3 million</a>, and Osmind is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/osmind-pitches-clinical-management-and-data-analysis-for-mental-health-practices-using-psychedelics/">up to some neat stuff regarding mental health</a>.</li>
<li>From the public markets, Atai Life Sciences, Compass Pathways, and MindMed are the companies worth watching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly this was a fun one to record, even if the topic at hand is actually rather serious. Chat Friday morning!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloverly.com/">Cloverly</a>, an Atlanta-based early stage startup, has developed an API that helps companies measure and then offset their carbon emissions. Today the company announced a $2.1 million seed round.</p>
<p>TechSquare Ventures led the round with participation from SoftBank Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures along with Circadian Ventures, Knoll Ventures, and SaaS Ventures .</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company announced that founder Anthony Oni has stepped back from running the company day-to-day, but will remain on the board as advisor. The company has hired former eBay exec Jason Rubottom as CEO in his place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a Sustainability as a Service company that helps other companies measure and reduce their carbon footprint. Our API measures the carbon emissions from various activities or processes within a business and allows that business or its customers to offset those emissions. And then it provides comprehensive reporting on that,&#8221; Rubottom explained.</p>
<p>Rudy Krehbiel, who runs operations for the company says that the API is designed to be flexible to meet the needs of each company accessing the services, but once developers create an application, it works automatically to measure emissions and purchase the offsets. &#8220;The solution itself is automated. Most of the work happens up front, and once we get integrated it becomes a fully productized and operationalized ongoing measurement and offsetting solution,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate sustainability initiatives may open doors for carbon offset startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/corporate-sustainability-initiatives-may-open-doors-for-carbon-offset-startups/embed/#?secret=sD8xoS9PUL" data-secret="sD8xoS9PUL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As customers build solutions using the tool, they can then offset their carbon usage by buying carbon offsets from the public markets, and this can be automated based on the usage of a given company. Cloverly monitors the offset market to ensure that the sources are credible and are adding new ones as they develop.</p>
<p>The company is working with over 600 brands, which have offset over 55 million pounds of carbon to this point. The API was originally conceived by Oni when he was working at the <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a> and spun out as a startup on Earth Day in 2019.</p>
<p>Oni, who is Black, is moving away from day-to-day operations as he hands the baton to Rubottom, but he recognizes the significance of this funding from a diversity perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Black tech founder of a climate tech company, it&#8217;s incredibly validating to have TechSquare Ventures and Softbank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund as investors. It will take diverse people and teams to find solutions to create a more sustainable future,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Daniel Simon </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alliance-data-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bread-301162702.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold Bread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer purchase finance and payments startup he’d co-founded, to Alliance Data Systems for over $500 million late last year, he quickly set his sights on building another startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, Simon says he observed how much strain was placed on what he described as ‘real-world’ businesses and their employees &#8212; such as truck drivers, plumbers, HVAC installers and last-mile delivery people &#8212; “and how little the last decade of innovation in fintech has done to meet the needs of the vast and vital fleets segment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he teamed up with former Lyft exec Andrew Woolf to found </span><a href="https://coastpay.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that is aiming to meet those needs with the mission of becoming “the financial platform for the future of transportation.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the New York-based company is announcing it has raised $6 million in an “oversubscribed” seed round of funding led by Better Tomorrow Ventures. Avid Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, BoxGroup, Colle, Foundation Capital, Greycroft, and Max Levchin’s SciFi VC &#8212; as well as more than a dozen angels including founders of Plaid, Flexport, Marqeta, Bread, Albert, Addi, Lithic, and other fintech and logistics startups &#8212; also put money in the round.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that operate fleets need to enable their drivers to pay for vehicle-related expenses when they’re on the road, such as maintenance, roadside assistance and gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once a fleet reaches a size of more than just a few vehicles, traditional small business credit cards are no longer sufficient because they lack the line-item level security, visibility, and controls necessary with a mobile workforce, according to Simon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fleet owners need transactions to be authorized, for instance, for buying gas for the company van, not the personal car, and for filling up at the pump, not making other purchases in the gas station convenience store,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, fleets have turned to specialized fleet and fuel credit cards which provide controls like restricting purchases to only fuel products of a particular grade or tracking expenses on a per-vehicle basis. But Simon argues that the companies that sell such cards were founded decades ago with very little innovation since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s goal is to use technology to provide fleet business owners and their employees payments products that are intuitive and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need their employee and vehicle payments integrated into the rest of their operations, and they need fair and transparent financial products that are simple to understand,” Simon said. Bottom line, he wants to bring the “same sort of ease of use and transparency that Bread brought to e-commerce consumers and retailers to a category of business and employee that is often overlooked in tech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s first product, which is set to launch later this year, is a commercial fuel charge card. Drivers will be able use a physical Coast card they keep in their wallet or a shared Coast card in the vehicle, and when they swipe it at a pump at any merchant that takes Visa, Simon says Coast will conduct a “rapid review of a complex set of rules to enforce the fleet business’s policies and flag potentially fraudulent transactions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need for entering data prompted by the pump &#8211; the driver fills up and is on their way,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleet owners and managers can use Coast’s web portal to assign drivers and vehicles, set policies and rules about who can purchase what, how much, how often, and when. They can also get reporting and alerts on their expense policies and potential abuse. At the end of the month, they will be able pay their Coast balance in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, the company plans to add integrations into major accounting platforms as well as into telematics platforms that provide real-time data on vehicle status and location “so it can provide actionable spending insights back to fleet managers.” Over time, Coast also plans to expand into more categories of fleet businesses’ spending as it seeks to become more of a holistic platform for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheel Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures, who took a seat on Coast’s board as part of the financing, says his firm was impressed by both the size of the opportunity and the team at Coast that’s tackling it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is one of those massive unsexy categories with huge incumbents that most people have never heard of but customers &#8212; who are forced to use them &#8212; universally despise. It&#8217;s the perfect recipe for a startup to come in and disrupt it with a much better experience,” Mohnot told TechCrunch via e-mail. “Similar to what Ramp or Brex do for startups, Coast does for fleet operators &#8211; it helps them control their spending so they can focus on growing their business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to detecting events transpiring anywhere in the world, few companies hold a candle to <a href="https://www.dataminr.com">Dataminr</a>. Founded in 2009, the company has raised more than $1 billion over the past 12 years (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/">including $475 million at a $4.1 billion valuation just this past March</a>) to build out a data-gobbling platform that transforms raw inputs into actionable event intelligence.</p>
<p>Those events are sent to a variety of customers — corporate security professionals, supply chain risk analysts, even journalists — for whatever purpose they need in their work. CEO and co-founder Ted Bailey said that the company has made event detection its core skillset. It’s “all been geared to the detection of events,” he said. “What we have never built into our corporate product is an advanced geospatial platform,” that would allow users to visualize risks rather than just getting a push notification or an email.</p>
<p>That’s about to change, as the company announced today its first acquisition in its corporate history with the purchase of UK-based <a href="https://watchkeeper.com">WatchKeeper</a>. WatchKeeper’s platform was designed to help corporate physical security executives visualize how events could affect a company’s assets. For instance, a bank with branches in Florida needs to understand what happens if a hurricane is heading toward the peninsula.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although Bailey said that “it’s a mature product — this is by no means an acquihire.” WatchKeeper, which was founded in 2018, previously raised £1 million from venture capitalists, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/watchkeeper-international/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>“Different organizations have extremely different needs, and these events have extremely different impacts on these corporations given the geographical footprint of their physical assets and their moving assets,” Bailey said. “This is something that we have zeroed in on [at Dataminr] more and more over the past couple of years.”</p>
<p>The startup had been on Dataminr’s radar even prior to the company inception. Hugh Farquhar, the founder and CEO of WatchKeeper, formerly worked at Citibank where Bailey said he built out a platform for contextualizing Dataminr alerts for the bank’s executives. After he left, Farquhar decided to build a similar platform for all companies.</p>
<p>As word got out about WatchKeeper’s product, Bailey saw an opportunity to bring Dataminr closer to the nascent company. “We were aggressively exploring a partnership with them for the last 6-12 months where we were scoping and imagining the possibilities of working together,” he said. “We had already selected them as the key innovator in data visualization, the one that was most tuned to corporate needs,” and eventually the partnership discussion became an acquisition conversation.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper’s entire team will move to Dataminr, and they will remain in the UK. Dataminr opened its European headquarters in the UK a few years ago, and the company has ambitious plans to spend heavily from its last round of capital on international expansion in Europe and in APAC.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper will be integrated into Dataminr Pulse later this year, the company’s product focused on business risk clients. Bailey said that from a data perspective, the acquisition pushes Dataminr into a new direction. “We have never taken that step of using public data outside of just detecting events,” he said. “We have a bunch of ideas on how to go beyond detecting events early,” which has been Dataminr’s main objective, to “real-time contextual data.” In addition, WatchKeeper integrates corporate internal data in a way that Dataminr hasn’t previously explored.</p>
<p>This is Dataminr’s first M&amp;A transaction, and while future transactions could be in the offing, there isn’t a specific strategy to hit a growth target through acquisitions in the future. The company continues to be headed toward an intended IPO, given that it dubbed its March round a “pre-IPO round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ZeroFox, a cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on social media and digital channels, has announced it has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dark-web/">dark web</a> threat intelligence company Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vigilante — not to be confused with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/">controversial crime reporting app</a> — scours the dark web to source intelligence that helps to protect organizations from cyberattacks. The deal, terms of which were not announced, will see ZeroFox take on Vigilante’s global team of operatives and analysts to create “the industry’s most robust” dark web intelligence solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on Vigilante’s decades-old dark web monitoring tools, the joint solution will combine datasets from the two companies to deliver risk intelligence on compromised credentials and botnets, network intelligence on infected and vulnerable hosts, and intelligence on threat actors and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The product, which will have ZeroFox&#8217;s AI processing capabilities baked-in, will also provide botnet exposure monitoring, threat monitoring, and client-specific investigations and incident response on threat actor engagement and asset recovery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The combination of our otherwise inaccessible datasets, our team of researchers and operatives, along with ZeroFox’s scale and artificial intelligence, provides a compelling dark web intelligence service,” said Mike Kirschner, co-founder of Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition, which the firms claim will help better protect organizations at an even greater scale, comes amid a huge rise in criminal activity on the dark web, according to recent research. As a result of pandemic-fueled cybercrime, Risk Based Security said in <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/">its recent annual data breach report</a> that the number of comprised records surpassed 37 billion in 2020, a 141% increase over 2019, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> was up by 100%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The dark web and criminal underground are critical requirements of modern threat intelligence programs,&#8221; said James C. Foster, CEO of ZeroFox. &#8220;Our customers need a clear view of the underground economy, how bots may be attacking them or if their credentials, credit cards, personally identifiable information (PII) and other information could be traded there, as well as understanding emerging tactics, exploits and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Foster said the acquisition of Vigilante increases &#8220;the scale and comprehensiveness&#8221; of its dark web intelligence gathering capabilities, which helps to protect customers&#8217; information.</p>
<p>In February last year, ZeroFox announced it had raised $74 million in a Series D funding round led by Intel Capital, which it planned to use to accelerate its global expansion and product strategy. Prior to this, in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/zerofox-secures-40m-series-c-to-help-manage-social-media-risk/">the startup raised $40 million Series C led by Redline Capital Management and Silver Lake Waterman</a>.</p>
