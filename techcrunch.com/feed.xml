										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its integrations with third-party apps. The company today announced the launch of two new tool sets for app developers, the TikTok Login Kit and Sound Kit, that will allow apps on mobile, web and consoles to authenticate users via their TikTok credentials, build experiences that leverage users&#8217; TikTok videos and share music and sounds back to TikTok from their own apps.</p>
<p>The company already offers tools that allow app developers to share content, including both pictures and videos, back to TikTok. But the new kits &#8212; or, SDKs (software development kits) &#8212; expand upon that functionality to make TikTok not just a destination for sharing, but a more deeply integrated part of the third-party app experience.</p>
<p>For starters, the new Login Kit allows an app&#8217;s users to sign in quickly using their TikTok log-in credentials, similar to other social log-ins offered by Facebook or Snap. Once signed in, users can then access their TikTok videos in the third-party app, potentially fueling entire new app ecosystems with TikTok content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2148156" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148156" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148156 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg 5001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Login-Kit-UI_Snack-.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148156" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>For example, a video dating app called <a href="https://www.thesnackapp.com/">Snack</a> is using the Login Kit to allow users to share their TikTok videos on their dating profiles to help them find new matches. The game recording app <a href="https://medal.tv/">Medal</a> will allow users to share their TikTok videos with their fellow gamers. And Singapore-based <a href="https://www.burpple.com/sg">Burpple</a> lets users share their food and dining reviews with a community.</p>
<p>Other early adopters of the Login Kit include gaming clips app <a href="https://allstar.gg/clips">Allstar</a>, anti-anxiety app <a href="https://www.breathwrk.com/?shortlink=9008545&amp;pid=Tiktok+Profile&amp;c=Tiktok">Breathwrk</a>, social app <a href="https://www.irl.com/">IRL</a>, as well as dating and friend-making apps <a href="https://thelollyapp.com/">Lolly</a>, <a href="https://www.meetme.com/">MeetMe</a>, <a href="https://monet.world/">Monet</a>, <a href="https://swipehouse.co/">Swipehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.emehive.co/">EME Hive</a>. Creator tool provider <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> is also using Login Kit, as is video game <a href="https://www.pubg.com/">PUBG</a>, which is only using the login functionality. A forthcoming NFT platform <a href="https://neonapp.com/">Neon</a> will use Login Kit, too.</p>
<p>When users log in to these apps via their TikTok credentials, they&#8217;ll then be presented with an additional permissions box that asks them if the app in question can read their profile information and access their public videos, which they then have to also agree to in order to take advantage of the additional video sharing options inside the app itself.</p>
<p>For the time being, these are the only permissions that Login Kit asks for &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t give the app access to further information, like who the TikTok user&#8217;s friends are, for example. If TikTok expands beyond these permissions in the future, it says it will be transparent with users about any changes or new additions. For the time being, however, the focus is more on allowing apps to better integrate TikTok content into their own experiences.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148155" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148155" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sound-Kit-UI_Rapchat.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148155" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok/Rapchat</p></div></p>
<p>The other new SDK launching today is the Sound Kit, which allows artists and creators to bring their original sounds and music from a third-party app into TikTok. This kit, which also requires Login Kit to work, will help TikTok seed its sounds database with more original content it doesn&#8217;t have to license from major labels. Instead, whatever licensing rights to the music and other sounds that exist within the original app will still apply to whatever is shared out to TikTok. But by sharing the music more broadly, creators can gain interest from potential fans and even see their sounds used as the backing for new TikTok videos.</p>
<p>Early adopters on this front include mobile multi-track recording studio <a href="https://www.audiobridge.com/">Audiobridge</a>, music creation and collaboration suite <a href="https://www.landr.com/en/">LANDR</a>, hip hop music creation app <a href="https://rapchat.me/">Rapchat</a> and upcoming audio recording and remix app <a href="https://www.yourdio.me/">Yourdio</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok says some of the apps selected as early partners for the SDKs were those that already adopted its Share to TikTok SDK, which launched in 2019. Others, however, were chosen based on a specific set of criteria, including the ability to move quickly to integrate the new features and the strength of their specific use cases. TikTok was looking for a diversity of use cases and those that were particularly novel &#8212; like building out a dating network based on videos, for instance.</p>
<p>More information on the new tools and developer documentation will be added to TikTok&#8217;s developer website, but TikTok says it will be vetting and reviewing developers who request access. And as most of the current developer partners are U.S.-based, with just a few exceptions, the company says it is looking to diversify the list of companies going forward, as this is a global initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;As TikTok becomes increasingly ingrained in culture, more third-party apps across a variety of categories and use cases are looking to tap into our community on their own platforms,&#8221; said Isaac Bess, TikTok&#8217;s Global Head of Distribution Partnerships, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;Through the Sound Kit and Login Kit for TikTok, we&#8217;re providing seamless integration solutions that help developers expand their reach, increase exposure for creators, and empower our community to showcase their content on other platforms,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap on Wednesday announced its plan to soon launch a Creator Marketplace, which will make it easier for businesses to find and partner with Snapchat creators, including lens creators, AR creators and later, prominent Snapchat creators known as Snap Stars. At launch, the marketplace will focus on connecting brands and AR creators for AR ads. It will then expand to support all Snap Creators by 2022.</p>
<p>The company had previously helped connect its creator community with advertisers through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/snapchat-storytellers/">its Snapchat Storytellers program</a>, which first launched into pilot testing in 2018 &#8212; already a late arrival to the space. However, that program&#8217;s focus was similar to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/brand-collabs-manager">Brand Collabs Manager,</a> as it focused on helping businesses find Snap creators who could produce video content.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s new marketplace, meanwhile, has a broader focus in terms of connecting all sorts of creators with the Snap advertising ecosystem. This includes Lens Creators, Developers and Partners, and then later, Snap&#8217;s popular creators with public profiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap says the Creator Marketplace will open to businesses later this month to help them partner with a select group of AR Creators in Snap&#8217;s Lens Network. These creators can help businesses build AR experiences without the need for extensive creative resources, which makes access to <a href="https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/advertising">Snap&#8217;s AR ads</a> more accessible to businesses, including smaller businesses without in-house developer talent.</p>
<p>Lens creators have already found opportunity working for businesses that want to grow their Snapchat presence &#8212; even allowing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/tech/snapchat-lens-creators">some creators to quit their day jobs</a> and just build lens for a living. Snap has been further investing in this area of its business, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/snap-announces-3-5m-fund-directed-toward-ar-lens-creation/">announced</a> in December a $3.5 million fund directed towards AR Lens creation. The company said at the time there were tens of thousands of Lens creators who had collectively made over 1.5 million Lenses to date.</p>
<p>Using Lenses has grown more popular, too, the company had noted, saying that over 180 million people interact with a Snapchat Lens every day — up from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/snapchat-debuts-a-library-of-selfie-filters/"> 70 million daily active users of Lenses</a> when the Lens Explorer section first launched in the app in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Snap says that over 200 million Snapchat users interact with augmented reality on a daily basis, on average, out of its 280 million daily users. The majority (over 90%) of these users are 13-25 year olds. In total, users are posting over 5 billion Snaps per day.</p>
<p>Snap says the Creator Marketplace will remain focused on connecting businesses with AR Lens Creators throughout 2021.</p>
<p>The following year, it will expand to include the community of professional creators and storytellers who understand the current trends and interests of the Snap user base and can help businesses with their ad campaigns. The company will not take a cut of the deals facilitated through the Marketplace, it says.</p>
<p>This would include the creators making content for Snap&#8217;s new TikTok rival, Spotlight, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">launched</a> in November 2020. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">encouraged</a> adoption of the feature by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html"> shelling out $1 million per day</a> to creators of top videos. In March 2021, over 125 million Snapchat users watched Spotlight, it says.</p>

<p>Spotlight isn&#8217;t the only way Snap is challenging TikTok.</p>
<p>The company also on Wednesday announced it&#8217;s snagging two of TikTok&#8217;s biggest stars for its <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snapchat-megan-thee-stallion-charli-dixie-damelio-1234966360/">upcoming Snap Originals lineup</a>: Charli and Dixie D&#8217;Amelio. The siblings, who have gained over 20 million follows on Snapchat this past year, will star in the series &#8220;Charli vs. Dixie.&#8221; Other new Originals will feature names like artist Megan Thee Stallion, actor Ryan Reynolds, twins and influencers Niki and Gabi DeMartino, and YouTube beauty vlogger Manny Mua, among others.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s shows were watched by over 400 million people in 2020, including 93% of the Gen Z population in the U.S., it noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity has been linked with equity and inclusion because diversity is just one part of the equation when it comes to hiring Black employees. How do the companies they work for make people feel welcome and included, rather than isolated? How do Black employees find their way into management, up the corporate ladder to the C Suite and into the boardroom?</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://valence.community/">Valence</a>, a startup dedicated to empowering Black professionals, announced a new program called BONDS, which is designed to help companies train, retain and promote Black employees.</p>
<p>Valence CEO Guy Primus says that the organization has almost 16,000 community members and recognizing that getting hired was just the first step in a long journey, the company wanted to find a more concrete way to help its members. He says that companies tend to focus too much on the hiring pipeline and don&#8217;t give enough attention to what happens after Black employees get hired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People want the numbers to go up, and there&#8217;s [this notion of] recruit, retain, and promote. The problem is that everyone is focussed on the recruiting pipeline, but they&#8217;re not focused on retention and promotion, which ultimately affects recruiting. So it&#8217;s an ecosystem problem, not a pipeline issue,&#8221; Primus explained.</p>
<p>Primus knew that the company needed to do more, and he hired Tracy Williams as vice president of learning and development to build a curriculum specifically designed to help Black professionals thrive.</p>

<p>Williams points out that Black professionals often find themselves isolated at companies without a lot of peers whom they can talk to. She wanted to create a program that could give people that sense of community where they could commiserate over the issues they face with people who understood their experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where an organization may not be able to provide that sense of community for their Black professionals, we&#8217;re able to do that for them and the benefit for those corporations and organizations is that they&#8217;re able to now invest in their Black employees&#8217; development and opportunities, while connecting with their peers on a more personal level and still being trained and developed as potential senior level leaders,&#8221; Williams told me.</p>
<p>She says that this also gives the company a way to hold organizations accountable when it comes to promoting Black employees into management and executive positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have this opportunity not only to provide the community for emerging Black executives, but also on the other side of the marketplace, create a tool of accountability for these organizations who are investing in their employees and ensuring that they are acknowledging their employees&#8217; readiness, and recognizing and promoting them based on their leadership readiness as well,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Among the organizations participating at the launch of this program are Accel, Electrolux, GGV Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Providence Strategic Growth, Roblox, Silicon Valley Bank and Upfront Ventures.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bevy raises $40M Series C with 20% coming from Black investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/bevy-raises-40m-series-c-with-20-coming-from-black-investors/embed/#?secret=rtdMoP43WW" data-secret="rtdMoP43WW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The program itself includes a couple of key components including a curriculum designed around three modules: leading self, leading others and leading within your organization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of the curriculum components across those three modules truly provides content and development for our members that focus on how they are able to represent themselves and navigate the nuances of being an emerging Black executive in their organization, how they&#8217;re able to amplify their leadership readiness, how they&#8217;re able to communicate more effectively in their organizations and externally as well, and the steps that they need to take in order to fully own their career development,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>But Williams wanted to do more than provide training materials for the members, she wanted to provide support for every member of the BONDS program. So the other component of this is a cohort with 10 peers in each one led by a facilitator and a coach who lead the members in deeper discussions about the training materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a safe space to practice what they&#8217;ve learned in the on demand curriculum, but also dive as deep as they need to in order to feel fully ready to promote themselves within their organization,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The program is trying to address a real problem related to Black employees getting the opportunity to grow into management and executive positions. The company pointed out that while Black professionals make up 12% of entry-level corporate jobs, just short of their 13.4% representation in the U.S. population, their numbers fall to 7% of management roles, according to research <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/Race-in-the-workplace-The-Black-experience-in-the-US-private-sector">conducted by McKinsey &amp; Co</a>.</p>
<p>The hope is that by providing a more concrete framework like BONDS, it can lead to closing this gap and helping more Black professionals climb the professional ladder in their organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was going to wait until after Square reported its Q1 results today to dig into the world of fintech earnings and what they might mean for startups, but something got stuck in my craw that matters more than what Jack&#8217;s team may have up its sleeve: How much space is being left in fintech when the major players are growing rapidly in categories where startups are doing their best to make a dent?</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;ll examine the buy now, pay later (BNPL) market, mostly through the lens of PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/v2/Q1-21-PayPal-Investor-Update.pdf">first-quarter results</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>PayPal&#8217;s BNPL results are impressive &#8212; and not just to your humble servant, but to other fintech watchers<a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1390097953369595913?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"> as well</a> &#8212; which begs the question: Can the platform effect that the PayPals of the world bring to bear suffocate a growing slice of the startup market?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There are obvious issues with the thought. The first being that BNPL-focused Affirm recently went public. And Affirm was, until very recently, a startup and later a unicorn. And then there&#8217;s BNPL player AfterPay, which went public a few years back, not to mention Klarna, which could go public sometime soon.</p>
<p>But what we&#8217;re watching is PayPal chase a handful of unicorns-and-later BNPL companies. What about the actual startups in the market? Can they hack it? Let&#8217;s dig into PayPal&#8217;s results, take a peek at what AfterPay&#8217;s own can tell us, and then we&#8217;ll noodle on the startup question. We&#8217;ll come back to all of this after Affirm reports in a few day&#8217;s time.</p>
<h2>Platforms versus startups</h2>
<p>The &#8220;kill-zone&#8221; concept &#8212; that startups should not get too close to what big tech companies do &#8212; has never sat well with me. Mostly because it&#8217;s not true that small companies cannot take on big ones. And because big companies have a really great history of crappifying their products into vulnerability.</p>
<p>A great example of the first count is Zoom, which took on a host of enterprise-ready, platform-supported video chat services and crushed them by simply being not awful. This brings us to our second point: As big tech companies need to keep finding incremental revenue adds from their existing products, they make them worse to find a marginal top line. The biggest tech shops often trade near-term economic growth for long-term market ownership.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re thrilled to announce Caryn Marooney is speaking at our upcoming T<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">echCrunch Early Stage virtual event in July</a>. She spoke with us last year and we had to have her back.</p>
<p>Just look at her resume. She was the co-founder and CEO of The Outcast Agency, one of Silicon Valley’s best-regarded public relations firms. She left her company to serve as VP of Global Communication at Facebook, which she did for eight years, overseeing communication for Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. In 2019 she joined Coatue Management as a general partner, where she went on to invest in Startburst, Supabase, Defined Networks and others.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Marooney is one of the Valley&#8217;s experts on getting people&#8217;s attention &#8212; a skill that&#8217;s critical when running a startup, nonprofit or school bake sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She said it best last year: “People just fundamentally aren’t walking around caring about this new startup — actually, nobody does.” So how do you get people to care? That&#8217;s the trick and why we&#8217;re having her back to speak on this evergreen topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/facebooks-former-pr-chief-explains-why-no-one-is-paying-attention-to-your-startup/">Watch her presentation from 2020 here</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p>
<p>One of the great things about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage</a> is that the show is designed around breakout sessions, with each speaker leading a chat around a specific startup core competency (like fundraising, designing a brand, mastering the art of PR and more). Moreover, there is plenty of time for audience Q&amp;A in each session.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">Pick up your ticket for the event</a>, which goes down July 8 and 9, right here. And if you do it today, you&#8217;ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=carolynpost&amp;display=true">save a cool $100 off</a> of your registration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inspired by his own problems with skin ailments, tech founder Daniel Jensen decided there had to be a better way. So, using an in-house tech platform, his Copenhagen-based startup <a href="https://noie.com/">Nøie</a> developed its own database of skin profiles, to better care for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Nøie has now raised $12m in a Series A funding round led by Talis Capital, with participation from Inventure,  as well as existing investors including Thomas Ryge Mikkelsen, former CMO of Pandora, and Kristian Schrøder Hart-Hansen, former CEO of LEO Pharma’s  Innovation Lab.</p>
<p>Nøie’s customized skincare products target sensitive skin conditions including acne, psoriasis and eczema. Using its own R&amp;D, Nøie says it screens thousands of skincare products on the market, selects what it thinks are the best, and uses an algorithm to assign customers to their &#8216;skin family’. Customers then get recommendations for customized products to suit their skin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Skin+Me is probably the best-known perceived competitor, but this is a prescription provider. Noie is non-prescription.</p>
<p>Jensen said: &#8220;We firmly believe that the biggest competition is the broader skincare industry and the consumer behavior that comes with it. I truly believe that in 2030 we&#8217;ll be surprised that we ever went into a store and picked up a one-size-fits-all product to combat our skincare issues, based on what has the nicest packaging or the best marketing. In a sense, any new company that emerges in this space are peers to us: we&#8217;re all working together to intrinsically change how people choose skincare products. We&#8217;re all demonstrating to people that they can now receive highly-personalized products based on their own skin&#8217;s specific needs.”</p>
<p>Of his own problems to find the right skincare provider, he said: &#8220;It&#8217;s just extremely difficult to find something that works. When you look at technology, online, and all our apps and everything, we got so smart in so many areas, but not when it comes to consumer skin products. I believe that in five or 10 years down the line, you&#8217;ll be laughing that we really used to just go in and pick up products just off the shelf, without knowing what we&#8217;re supposed to be using. I think everything we will be using in the bathroom will be customized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beatrice Aliprandi, principal at Talis Capital, said: &#8220;For too long have both the dermatology sector and the skincare industry relied on the outdated &#8216;one-size-fits-all&#8217; approach to addressing chronic skin conditions. By instead taking a data-driven and community feedback approach, Nøie is building the next generation of skincare by providing complete personalization for its customers at a massive scale, pioneering the next revolution in skincare.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI is fundamental to many products and services today, but its hunger for data and computing cycles is bottomless. <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">Lightmatter</a> plans to leapfrog Moore&#8217;s law with its ultra-fast photonic chips specialized for AI work, and with a new $80M round the company is poised to take its light-powered computing to market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/">We first covered Lightmatter in 2018</a>, when the founders were fresh out of MIT and had raised $11M to prove that their idea of photonic computing was as valuable as they claimed. They spent the next three years and change building and refining the tech — and running into all the hurdles that hardware startups and technical founders tend to find.</p>
<p>For a full breakdown of what the company&#8217;s tech does, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/">read that feature</a> — the essentials haven&#8217;t changed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dEvauhgfo6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/">Lightmatter aims to reinvent AI-specific chips with photonic computing and $11M in funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lightmatter aims to reinvent AI-specific chips with photonic computing and $11M in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/lightmatter-aims-to-reinvent-ai-specific-chips-with-photonic-computing-and-11m-in-funding/embed/#?secret=dEvauhgfo6" data-secret="dEvauhgfo6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a nutshell, Lightmatter&#8217;s chips perform certain complex calculations fundamental to machine learning in a flash — literally. Instead of using charge, logic gates, and transistors to record and manipulate data, the chips use photonic circuits that perform the calculations by manipulating the path of light. It&#8217;s been possible for years, but until recently getting it to work at scale, and for a practical, indeed a highly valuable purpose has not.</p>
<h2>Prototype to product</h2>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t entirely clear in 2018 when Lightmatter was getting off the ground whether this tech would be something they could sell to replace more traditional compute clusters like the thousands of custom units companies like Google and Amazon use to train their AIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew in principle the tech should be great, but there were a lot of details we needed to figure out,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Nick Harris told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;Lots of hard theoretical computer science and chip design challenges we needed to overcome&#8230; and COVID was a beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>With suppliers out of commission and many in the industry pausing partnerships, delaying projects, and other things, the pandemic put Lightmatter months behind schedule, but they came out the other side stronger. Harris said that the challenges of building a chip company from the ground up were substantial, if not unexpected.</p>

<p>&#8220;In general what we&#8217;re doing is pretty crazy,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;We&#8217;re building computers from nothing. We design the chip, the chip package, the card the chip package sits on, the system the cards go in, and the software that runs on it&#8230;. we&#8217;ve had to build a company that straddles all this expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>That company has grown from its handful of founders to more than 70 employees in Mountain View and Boston, and the growth will continue as it brings its new product to market.</p>
<p>Where a few years ago Lightmatter&#8217;s product was more of a well-informed twinkle in the eye, now it has taken a more solid form in the Envise, which they call a &#8216;general purpose photonic AI accelerator.&#8221; It&#8217;s a server unit designed to fit into normal datacenter racks but equipped with multiple photonic computing units, which can perform neural network inference processes at mind-boggling speeds. (It&#8217;s limited to certain types of calculations, namely linear algebra for now, and not complex logic, but this type of math happens to be a major component of machine learning processes.)</p>
<p>Harris was reticent to provide exact numbers on performance improvements, but more because those improvements are increasing than that they&#8217;re not impressive enough. The website suggests it&#8217;s 5x faster than an NVIDIA A100 unit on a large transformer model like BERT, while using about 15 percent of the energy. That makes the platform doubly attractive to deep-pocketed AI giants like Google and Amazon, which constantly require both more computing power and who pay through the nose for the energy required to use it. Either better performance or lower energy cost would be great — both together is irresistible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Lightmatter&#8217;s initial plan to test these units with its most likely customers by the end of 2021, refining it and bringing it up to production levels so it can be sold widely. But Harris emphasized this was essentially the Model T of their new approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re right, we just invented the next transistor,&#8221; he said, and for the purposes of large-scale computing, the claim is not without merit. You&#8217;re not going to have a miniature photonic computer in your hand any time soon, but in datacenters, where as much as 10 percent of the world&#8217;s power is predicted to go by 2030, &#8220;they really have unlimited appetite.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The color of math</h2>

<p>There are two main ways by which Lightmatter plans to improve the capabilities of its photonic computers. The first, and most insane sounding, is processing in different colors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so wild when you think about how these computers actually work. Transistors, which have been at the heart of computing for decades, use electricity to perform logic operations, opening and closing gates and so on. At a macro scale you can have different frequencies of electricity that can be manipulated like waveforms, but at this smaller scale it doesn&#8217;t work like that. You just have one form of currency, electrons, and gates are either open or closed.</p>
<p>In Lightmatter&#8217;s devices, however, light passes through waveguides that perform the calculations as it goes, simplifying (in some ways) and speeding up the process. And light, as we all learned in science class, comes in a variety of wavelengths — all of which can be <em>used independently and simultaneously on the same hardware.</em></p>
<p>The same optical magic that lets a signal sent from a blue laser be processed at the speed of light works for a red or a green laser with minimal modification. And if the light waves don&#8217;t interfere with one another, they can travel through the same optical components at the same time without losing any coherence.</p>
<p>That means that if a Lightmatter chip can do, say, a million calculations a second using a red laser source, adding another color doubles that to two million, adding another makes three — with very little in the way of modification needed. The chief obstacle is getting lasers that are up to the task, Harris said. Being able to take roughly the same hardware and near-instantly double, triple, or 20x the performance makes for a nice roadmap.</p>
<p>It also leads to the second challenge the company is working on clearing away, namely <em>interconnect</em>. Any supercomputer is composed of many small individual computers, thousands and thousands of them, working in perfect synchrony. In order for them to do so, they need to communicate constantly to make sure each core knows what other cores are doing, and otherwise coordinate the immensely complex computing problems supercomputing is designed to take on. (Intel talks about this &#8220;concurrency&#8221; problem building an exa-scale supercomputer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/intel-and-argonne-national-lab-on-exascale-and-their-new-aurora-supercomputer/">here</a>.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Intel and Argonne National Lab on &#8216;exascale&#8217; and their new Aurora supercomputer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/intel-and-argonne-national-lab-on-exascale-and-their-new-aurora-supercomputer/embed/#?secret=UZiZS5dsHh" data-secret="UZiZS5dsHh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve learned along the way is, how do you get these chips to talk to each other when they get to the point where they&#8217;re so fast that they&#8217;re just sitting there waiting most of the time?&#8221; said Harris. The Lightmatter chips are doing work so quickly that they can&#8217;t rely on traditional computing cores to coordinate between them.</p>
<p>A photonic problem, it seems, requires a photonic solution: a wafer-scale interconnect board that uses waveguides instead of fiber optics to transfer data between the different cores. Fiber connections aren&#8217;t exactly slow, of course, but they aren&#8217;t infinitely fast, and the fibers themselves are actually fairly bulky at the scales chips are designed, limiting the number of channels you can have between cores.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the optics, the waveguides, into the chip itself; we can fit 40 waveguides into the space of a single optical fiber,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;That means you have way more lanes operating in parallel — it gets you to absurdly high interconnect speeds.&#8221; (Chip and server fiends can find that specs <a href="https://lightmatter.co/products/passage/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The optical interconnect board is called Passage, and will be part of a future generation of its Envise products — but as with the color calculation, it&#8217;s for a future generation. 5-10x performance at a fraction of the power will have to satisfy their potential customers for the present.</p>
<h2>Putting that $80M to work</h2>
<p>Those customers, initially the &#8220;hyper-scale&#8221; data handlers that already own datacenters and supercomputers that they&#8217;re maxing out, will be getting the first test chips later this year. That&#8217;s where the B round is primarily going, Harris said: &#8220;We&#8217;re funding our early access program.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means both building hardware to ship (very expensive per unit before economies of scale kick in, not to mention the present difficulties with suppliers) and building the go-to-market team. Servicing, support, and the immense amount of software that goes along with something like this — there&#8217;s a lot of hiring going on.</p>
<p>The round itself was led by Viking Global Investors, with participation from HP Enterprise, Lockheed Martin, SIP Global Partners, and previous investors GV, Matrix Partners and Spark Capital. It brings their total raised to about $113 million; There was the initial $11M A round, then GV hopping on with a $22M A-1, then this $80M.</p>
<p>Although there are other companies pursuing photonic computing and its potential applications in neural networks especially, Harris didn&#8217;t seem to feel that they were nipping at Lightmatter&#8217;s heels. Few if any seem close to shipping a product, and at any rate this is a market that is in the middle of its hockey stick moment. He pointed to an OpenAI study indicating that the demand for AI-related computing is increasing far faster than existing technology can provide it, except with ever larger datacenters.</p>
<p>The next decade will bring economic and political pressure to rein in that power consumption, just as we&#8217;ve seen with the cryptocurrency world, and Lightmatter is poised and ready to provide an efficient, powerful alternative to the usual GPU-based fare.</p>
<p>As Harris suggested hopefully earlier, what his company has made is potentially transformative in the industry and if so there&#8217;s no hurry — if there&#8217;s a gold rush, they&#8217;ve already staked their claim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m going to be honest with you: It was kind of a slow week for robotics news. Honestly, that’s the first time I can say that since I started doing this thing weekly (happy 10 weeks to us, by the way). Of course, this stuff always ebbs and flows to a certain extent &#8212; even during what’s been a particularly active stretch in robotics investments.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, the $56 million Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/path-robotics-raises-56m-series-b-for-automated-welding/"> for Path Robotics</a> is the big news of the week. And, indeed, it’s a sizeable round for the Columbus, Ohio-based company. It’s certainly cool seeing a big win for robots in the Midwest &#8212; particularly ones that fit pretty nicely into the manufacturing mold.</p>
<p>The company specializes in welding robotics &#8212; one in a long list of manufacturing jobs with a shortage of available workers. The company cites the American Welding Society, which puts the shortage potentially as high as 400,000 by the year 2024. Interest is also being driven by the pandemic, as more companies are looking for ways to move some of the process back to U.S. shores.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Speaking of manufacturing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/symbio-is-working-with-toyota-and-nissan-to-increase-robotic-assembly-efficiency/">I spoke to a company</a> called Symbio Robotics, way back in February. The big news then was that the Bay Area-based startup with partnering with Nissan and Toyota. Now it adds yet another massive automotive name to the list <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005302/en/Symbio-Robotics---The-Tech-Behind-Ford-Motor-Company%E2%80%99s-AI-enabled-Assembly-Line">with the addition of Ford</a>. The U.S. car giant has been making a lot of investments in robotics across the board in recent years.</p>
<p>“As the mobility landscape continues to rapidly change there is an increasing demand for much faster product life cycles,” Ford’s Advanced Controls and Digital Factory Manager Harry Kekedjian said in a release. “Using the Symbio technology, we’ve observed a 15% improvement in cycle time and greater than 50% reduction in adapting to new products over the previous manufacturing method.”</p>

<p>We haven’t written a ton about Miso Robotics lately &#8212; at least not since the company announced a partnership with Harold and Kumar’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/white-castle-rolls-out-more-robots-from-miso-robotics-to-cook-in-its-kitchens/">old haunt back in October</a>.

<p>The company runs two studios, one focused on casual and one on &#8216;hyper-casual&#8217; games.</p>
<p>Co-founded by CEO Hakan Bas, the former Co-Founder, and COO at Peak Games, Ace Games has had some success on the US iOS Store with its hyper-casual title, ‘Mix and Drink.’</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Bas said: “Ace’s main focus is actually the casual ‘hybrid puzzle’ game that we have been working on for a while now. However, our hyper-casual studio assists the main studio in many aspects like training talent, coming up with creative game mechanics and marketing ideas, generating cash, and creating user base.” Ace’s casual title is to be released late-summer this year and the global launch is expected in early 2022.</p>
<p>Peak Games, Gram Games and Rollic Games were all acquired by Zynga, showing that Turkey is capable of producing decent exits for gaming startups.</p>
<p>VCs such as Index, Balderton, Makers and Griffin have all made M&amp;A  deals with Dream Games, Bigger Games and Spyke Games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For every crypto-skeptic that see NFTs as yet another hype bubble, there&#8217;s an acolyte who sees NFTs as the key to unlocking the future of the creative web.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitski.com/">Bitski</a>, an SF-based startup that builds custom NFT storefronts for brands and creators, is banking on the latter and they have new investors betting the same. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $19 million in a Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. The firm joins a host of creators and celebrities including Jay Z, MrBeast, Serena Willliams and 3LAU in backing the startup.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The NFT space has gotten awfully crowded lately, riding a wave of investor hype and billions of dollars worth of transactions in the past several months. While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">high-dollar artwork sold by artists like Beeple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">exclusive crypto communities like CryptoPunks</a> have been hotbeds of activity, founders like those behind Bitski believe that these blockchain-backed digital goods are going to inspire a massive transformation in how artists, influencers and brands monetize their online popularity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bitski is aiming to allow mainstream brands and celebrities to bypass the crypto complexity of early marketplaces, hoping to give customers like early partner Adidas an on-ramp to the NFT world that&#8217;s more approachable to consumers who understand digital items but might not have fully bought into crypto. The startup sells creators a variety of subscription plans to power custom NFT storefronts that they can sell through as their own channel rather than pushing users to wide-ranging marketplaces. </span></p>
<p>There are plenty of arguments among builders and users of NFT platforms surrounding which elements of a service should be blockchain-based and which should default to more time-honed e-commerce flows. Bitski often errs on the side of user familiarity, allowing credit card purchases on the platform, &#8220;forgot your password&#8221; functionality and user wallets hosted on Bitski&#8217;s own server hardware. They&#8217;re controversial onboarding choices that won&#8217;t satisfy crypto purists and decentralization advocates but will likely help new users get acquainted with NFTs quickly.</p>
<p>With the company&#8217;s Series A closed, Bitski has raised some $23.4 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic of compensation has historically been a delicate one that has left many people &#8212; especially startup employees &#8212; wondering just what drives what can feel like random decisions around pay and equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, software engineers (and housemates) Miles Hobby and Geoffrey Tisserand set about trying to solve the problem for companies by developing a data-driven platform that aims to help companies structure their compensation plans and transparently communicate them to candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now today, the startup behind that platform, Figure, announced it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by CRV. Bling Capital, Better Tomorrow Ventures and Garage Capital also participated in the financing, along with angel investors such as AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant, Jason Calacanis, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and other executives based in Silicon Valley.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has amassed a client list that includes other startups such as fintechs Brex and NerdWallet and AI-powered fitness company Tempo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Hobby and Tisserand’s mission is to improve workflows and transparency around pay, particularly equity. The pair had both worked at startups themselves (Uber and Instacart, respectively) and ended up leaving money on the table when they left those companies because no one had properly explained to them what their equity, which changed at every valuation, meant.  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148277" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148277" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148277 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-Co-Founders-and-Co-CEOs-Miles-Hobby-and-Geoffrey-Tisserand-1.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148277" class="wp-caption-text">Figure co-founders and co-CEOs Miles Hobby and Geoffrey Tisserand. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Figure</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, one of their goals was to create a solution that would provide a user-friendly explanation of what a person’s equity stake really means, from tax implications to whether or not they have to buy the stock and/or hold onto it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve gone through the job search process many times before and there’s all these complex legal documents to understand why you’re getting 10,000 stock options, but obviously we knew the vast majority of people have no idea how that works,” Tisserand told TechCrunch. “We saw an opportunity there to help companies actually convey the value to their candidates while also making them aware of the potential risks of owning something that’s so illiquid.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148280" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148280" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2148280 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png" alt="" width="624" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Figure-screen-grab.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148280" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Figure</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another goal of Figure’s is to help create a more fair and balanced process about decisions around pay and equity so that there’s less inequality out there. Pointedly, it aims to remove some of the biases that exist around those decisions by systematizing the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw a void in this kind of context around equity&#8230;and knew that there had to be a better way for companies to structure, manage and explain their compensation plans,” Hobby said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Hobby and Tisserand, Figure is designed to help stop instances of implicit bias.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Compensation should be based on the work that you’re doing, and not gender or ethnic background,” Tisserand told TechCrunch. “We’re trying to give that context and remove biases. So, we’re trying to help at two different stages –– to surface inequities that already exist and make sure there are no anomalies, and then to help stop them before they can exist.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure also aims to give companies the tools to educate candidates and employees on their total compensation — including equity, salary, benefits and bonuses — in a “straightforward and user-friendly” way. For example, it can create custom offer letters that interactively detail a candidate’s compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is for Figure to become an operating system for compensation, where a company can encode their compensation philosophy into our system, and we help them determine their job architecture, compensation bands and offer numbers while monitoring their compensation health to provide adjustment suggestions when needed,” Hobby said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-hire, Figure’s compensation management system “helps keep everything running smoothly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Khan, general partner of enterprise software at CRV, is joining Figure’s board as part of the funding. The decision to back the startup was in part personal, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d been investing in software for eight years and was alarmed that no one was building anything around pay equity when it comes to how we’re paid, why we’re paid what we’re paid and on how to build equity long term,” Khan told TechCrunch. “Unfortunately, discussions around compensation and equity still happen behind closed doors and this extends into workflow around compensation &#8212; equally broken &#8212; with manual leveling, old data and large pay inequities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its product offerings and scale its organization.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As ESG reporting goes up the agenda for large companies, it’s also increasingly doing so for smaller companies as well. But right now, tracking things like your company’s CO2 emissions is mainly the preserve of large corporations. Now a startup hopes to address this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.diginex-solutions.com/">Diginex Solutions</a> has a self-guided tool which claims to generate ESG reports six times faster than competitors and comes in at a relatively affordable $99 per month.</p>
<p>The blockchain-enabled reporting tool also generates reports, giving companies the ability to demonstrate their ESG creds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DiginexESG is certified by the GRI, an international independent standards organization and now operates in the US, UK, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chile. It is currently raising venture backing largely from strategic corporate investors.</p>
<p>Competitors include Turnkey Group, NASDAQ Onereport, Enablon (raised $15M) and World-favour.</p>
<p>Mark Blick, CEO at Diginex Solutions said, “The current landscape of ESG reporting is challenging for many organizations &#8211; particularly SMEs &#8211; requiring huge consultancy fees, time and resources that distracts from day-to-day activity. The DiginexESG platform quite simply takes away those challenges and does all the heavy lifting for them. It’s like Docusign, Dropbox, TurboTax or Slack hardcoded for ESG reporting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicles rely on many sensors to perceive the world around them, and while cameras and lidar get a lot of the attention, good old radar is an important piece of the puzzle — though it has some fundamental limitations. <a href="https://www.oculii.com/">Oculii</a>, which just raised a $55M round, aims to minimize those limitations and make radar more capable with a smart software layer for existing devices — and sell its own as well.</p>
<p>Radar&#8217;s advantages lie in its superior range, and in the fact that its radio frequency beams can pass through things like raindrops, snow, and fog — making it crucial for perceiving the environment during inclement weather. Lidar and ordinary visible light cameras can be totally flummoxed by these common events, so it&#8217;s necessary to have a backup.</p>
<p>But radar&#8217;s major disadvantage is that, due to the wavelengths and how the antennas work, it can&#8217;t image things in detail the way lidar can. You tend to get very precisely located blobs rather than detailed shapes. It still provides invaluable capabilities in a suite of sensors, but if anyone could add a bit of extra fidelity to its scans, it would be that much better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Oculii does — take an ordinary radar and supercharge it. The company claims a 100x improvement to spatial resolution accomplished by handing over control of the system to its software. Co-founder and CEO Steven Hong explained in an email that a standard radar might have, for a 120 degree field of view, a 10 degree spatial resolution, so it can tell where something is with a precision of a few degrees on either side, and little or no ability to tell the object&#8217;s elevation.</p>
<p>Some are better, some worse, but for the purposes of this example that amounts to an effectively 12&#215;1 resolution. Not great!</p>
<p>Handing over control to the Oculii system, however, which intelligently adjusts the transmissions based on what it&#8217;s already perceiving, could raise that to a 0.5° horizonal x 1° vertical resolution, giving it an effective resolution of perhaps 120&#215;10. (Again, these numbers are purely for explanatory purposes and aren&#8217;t inherent to the system.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a huge improvement and results in the ability to see that something is, for example, two objects near each other and not one large one, or that an object is smaller than another near it, or — with additional computation — that it is moving one way or the other at such and such a speed relative to the radar unit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video demonstration of one of their own devices, showing considerably more detail than one would expect:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/503276130" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Exactly how this is done is part of Oculii&#8217;s proprietary magic, and Hong did not elaborate much on how exactly the system works. &#8220;Oculii’s sensor uses AI to adaptively generate an &#8216;intelligent&#8217; waveform that adapts to the environment and embed information across time that can be leveraged to improve the resolution significantly,&#8221; he said. (Integrating information over time is what gives it the &#8220;4D&#8221; moniker, by the way.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little sizzle reel that gives a very general idea:</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/505229486" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Autonomous vehicle manufacturers have not yet hit on any canonical set of sensors that AVs should have, but something like Oculii could give radar a more prominent place — its limitations sometimes mean it is relegated to emergency braking detection at the front or some such situation. With more detail and more data, radar could play a larger role in AV decisionmaking systems.</p>
<p>The company is definitely making deals — it&#8217;s working with Tier-1s and OEMs, one of which (Hella) is an investor, which gives a sense of confidence in Oculii&#8217;s approach. It&#8217;s also working with radar makers and has some commercial contracts looking at a 2024-2025 timeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148310" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148310" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2148310" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg" alt="CG render of Oculii's two radar units." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EAGLE-vs-FALCON2.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2148310" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Oculii</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also getting into making its own all-in-one radar units, doing the hardware-software synergy thing. It claims these are the world&#8217;s highest resolution radars, and I don&#8217;t see any competitors out there contradicting this — the simple fact is radars don&#8217;t compete much on &#8220;resolution,&#8221; but more on the precision of their rangefinding and speed detection.</p>
<p>One exception might be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/">Echodyne</a>, which uses a metamaterial radar surface to direct a customizable radar beam anywhere in its field of view, examining objects in detail or scanning the whole area quickly. But even then its &#8220;resolution&#8221; isn&#8217;t so easy to estimate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>At any rate the company&#8217;s new Eagle and Falcon radars might be tempting to manufacturers working on putting together cutting-edge sensing suites for their autonomous experiments or production driver-assist systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that with radar tipped as a major component of autonomous vehicles, robots, aircraft and other devices, it&#8217;s worth investing seriously in the space. The $55M B round certainly demonstrates that well enough. It was, as Oculii&#8217;s press release lists it, &#8220;co-led by Catapult Ventures and Conductive Ventures, with participation from Taiwania Capital, Susquehanna Investment Group (SIG), HELLA Ventures, PHI-Zoyi Capital, R7 Partners, VectoIQ, ACVC Partners, Mesh Ventures, Schox Ventures, and Signature Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money will allow for the expected scaling and hiring, and as Hong added, &#8220;continued investment of the technology to deliver higher resolution, longer range, more compact and cheaper sensors that will accelerate an autonomous future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rechargepayments.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of subscription management software for e-commerce, announced today that it has raised $227 million in a Series B growth round at a $2.1 billion valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit Partners, ICONIQ Growth and Bain Capital Ventures provided the capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Santa Monica, California-based ReCharge was bootstrapped for several years before raising $50 million in a previously undisclosed Series A from Summit Partners in January of 2020. And, it’s currently cash flow positive, according to company execs. With this round, ReCharge has raised a total of $277 million in funding.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the company&#8217;s SaaS platform has evolved from a subscription billing/payments platform to include a broader set of offerings aimed at helping e-commerce businesses boost revenues and cut operating costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, ReCharge&#8217;s cloud-based software is designed to give e-commerce merchants a way to offer and manage subscriptions for physical products. It also aims to help these brands, primarily direct to consumer companies, grow by providing them with ways to “easily” add subscription offerings to their business with the goal of turning one-time purchasers “into loyal, repeat customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has some impressive growth metrics, no doubt in part driven by the COVID-19 pandemic’s push to all things digital. ReCharge’s ARR grew 146% in 2020, while revenue grew over 136% over the same period, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Oisin O’Connor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although he declined to reveal hard numbers. The startup has 15,000 customers and 20 million subscribers across 180 countries on its platform. Customers include Harry’s, Oatly, Fiji Water, Billie and Native. But even prior to the pandemic, it had doubled its processing volume each year for the past five years and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">processed over $5.3 billion in transactions since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge also has 328 employees, up from 140 in January of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw many brick and mortar stores, such as Oatly, offer their products through subscriptions as a result of the pandemic in 2020,” O’Connor told TechCrunch. “Certain categories such as food &amp; beverage and pet foods were some of the fastest growing segments in total subscriber count, with 100% and 147% increases, respectively, as non-discretionary spending shifted online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was surprised to see that growth also extend beyond the most obvious categories. For example, ReCharge saw beauty care products subscribers grow by 120% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, we saw a 91% subscriber growth in 2020 across the board in all categories of subscriptions,” O’Connor told TechCrunch. “We believe there is a combination of factors at play: the pandemic, the rise of physical subscriptions and the rise of direct-to-consumer buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCharge plans to use its fresh capital to accelerate hiring in both R&amp;D (engineering and product) and go-to-market functions such as sales, marketing and customer success. It plans to continue its expansion into other e-commerce platforms such as BigCommerce, Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Magento, and outside of North America into other geographic markets, starting with Europe. ReCharge also plans to “broaden” its acquisition scope so that it can “accelerate” its time-to-market in certain domains, according to O’Connor, and of course build upon its products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoonkee Sull, partner at ICONIQ Growth, said his firm has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">watching the rapid rise of subscription commerce for several years “as more merchants have looked for ways to deepen relationships with loyal customers and consumers increasingly have sought out more convenient and flexible ways to buy from their favorite brands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, ICONIQ is betting on its belief that ReCharge “will continue to take significant share in a fast-growing market,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sull believes the ReCharge team identified the subscription e-commerce opportunity early on and addresses the numerous nuanced needs of the market with “a fully-featured product that uniquely enables both the smallest merchants and largest brands to easily adopt and scale with their platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Collins, managing director at Summit Partners, was impressed that the company saw so much growth without external capital for years, due to its “efficiency and discipline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ReCharge team identified a true </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product-market fit and built a product that customers love &#8212; which has fueled strong organic growth as the business has scaled,” Collins added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Desktop Metal today announced the launch of wood 3D printing tool, Forust. Founded in 2019, the company specializes in 3D printing for interior design. The company’s “non-destructive” printing methods have managed to largely fly under the radar, with minimal press coverage until now &#8212; making them a pretty ideal acquisition candidate.</p>
<p>In fact, the gross assets acquisition actually occurred back in October 2020, according to a filing, which pegs it at a price at $2.5 million, including $2 million in cash considerations. Since then, it seems, the two have been working together ahead of an official launch.</p>
<p>In a press release issued today, Desktop Metal is positioning Forust as the name of the new manufacturing process now in the company’s portfolio. The technology utilizes cellulose dust and lignin, byproducts from the wood and paper industries, respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As part of Desktop Metal, Forust is empowering architects, designers, and manufacturers to leverage design-forward technology to rethink how wood waste streams are used &#8212; whether you’re looking to manufacture one, one thousand or one million pieces,” Forust co-founder and CEO Andrew Jeffery tells TechCrunch. “Forust has the ability to bring 3D-printed, sustainable wood designs to life for businesses and consumers to create beautiful, sturdy wood products to support various industries, such as interior design, furniture and consumer home goods.”</p>
<p>Starting today, the companies will offer samples and designs online. The list of products includes architectural accents, pieces of furniture and home products like bowls and flower pots.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148445" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148445" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2148445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Forust_Auto-ShiftKnob.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148445" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Desktop Metal</p></div></p>
<p>“Applications for Forust’s wood parts are really limitless,” said Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop, says in a press release. “There are many applications where polymers and plastics are used today where you can now cost-effectively replace with sustainably manufactured wood parts &#8212; luxurious high-end components in interiors, consumer electronics, instruments, aviation, boats, home goods and eventually in flooring and exterior roofing applications.”</p>
<p>In addition to Forust, the same filing reveals that the company also purchased the &#8220;single acquired technology asset&#8221; of Figur Machine Tools, a sheet metal printing company, for $3.5 million. In August, Desktop Metal announced it was going public via a SPAC that valued it at $2.5 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking isn’t simple for at least <a href="https://identifythesigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ASHA_Identify-the-Signs_Fact-Sheet-Final.pdf">40 million Americans</a>, so a new Austin-based startup is scaling a solution. <a href="https://www.expressable.io/">Expressable</a> is a digital speech therapy company that connects patients to speech language pathologists (SLP) via telehealth services and asynchronous support, and it has raised a new $4.5 million seed round.</p>
<p>The early-stage startup is launching with an explicit focus on serving the approximately five million children in the United States that have a communication disorder. What might start as an occasional stutter could turn into a communication disorder over time &#8211; so the startup is looking to intervene early to get kids on a clearer path.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019 by married co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-barbara-7735bb61/">Nicholas Barbara</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanne-sherred/">Leanne Sherred</a>, Expressable has served thousands of families to date. Today, the duo announced its seed funding, co-led by Lerer Hippeau and NextView Ventures, with participation from Amplifyher Ventures. The money will be used to expand its provider network, go in-network, and focus on its edtech service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>
<p>Put simply, Expressable connects children to speech-language pathologists on a recurring basis. The therapy is done live via<a href="https://zoom.us/healthcare"> Zoom for Healthcare</a> with licensed professionals that Expresssable employs full-time. Clients are matched with a therapist in their area of need, from public speaking to vocal cord paralysis. Parents are able to reach their children’s SLP through secure SMS for coordination, questions, and rescheduling throughout the week.</p>
<p>On top of real-time support, the virtual speech therapy provider has a suite of asynchronous services. The company is building an e-learning platform with homework assignments and lessons, prescribed by the therapist and provided via SMS, for parents to do with their children to reinforce the speech care plans.</p>
<p>The activities are meant to be bite-sized &#8211; used when driving to the grocery store or cooking dinner or playing in the backyard &#8211; and tailored for interaction with children. The lessons can be as simple as creating opportunities for a kid to ask for juice, or to practice two-word utterances with an imitation game.</p>

<p>This unique edtech bit of Expressable leans heavily on parent involvement in the therapy process. Parental help has been shown to increase positive outcomes, but notably it could also leave low-income, working class families out of the mix. Its price, on average, is $59 per week, and that’s currently only out of pocket rather than subsidized by insurance.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of content for speech language pathologists by speech language pathologists, but not a lot of content by [SLPs] for parents, written in a way that is consumable,” Barbara said. “It just felt like a huge opportunity and market gap.”</p>
<p>Part of Expressable’s value is that it’s better than the status quo, which surprisingly often actually amounts to nothing. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, about 8 to 9 percent of children have a speech sound disorder in the country &#8212; but only half actually get treatment. What might start as an occasional stutter could turn into a communication disorder over time &#8211; so Expressable wants to intervene early to get kids on the right path.</p>
<p>“Public schools are the number-one provider for pediatric speech but they are unfortunately notoriously underfunded,” said Sherred. Children who are lucky enough to be eligible for school services are often provided them in a group setting, she continued, which lengthens the amount of time it takes to make progress.</p>
<p>Sherred witnessed the “incredibly frustrating cycle” created by gaps in school intervention first-hand as a SLP. She has spent the majority of her career in in-home health, where she would work in homes and daycares directly with children.</p>
<p>The majority of Expressable’s user base are children, but about 35% are adults, signaling how speech issues can continue past childhood.</p>
<p>Meagan Loyst, who sourced the Expressabble deal for Lerer Hippeau, is one example. Lloyst was diagnosed with a speech and voice condition in late 2020 and needed to find remote SLP therapy, which introduced her to the challenges of finding a high-quality specialized SLP.</p>
<p>“Before Expressable, there was no consumer-facing brand out there solving these pain points for individuals with communications disorders,” Loyst said. “It&#8217;s evident that they&#8217;re already hiring the best SLPs out there, bringing parents and education into the process to focus on better outcomes for children, and doing so in a cost-effective and convenient way through virtual care.”</p>
<h2><strong>Telehealth with a twist</strong></h2>
<p>While telehealth usage remains above pre-pandemic levels, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/01/telehealth-visits-decline-covid19-hospitals/">visits are on the decline.</a> One challenge for any digital telehealth startup, Expressable included, is how to make a convincing pitch for moving caretaking fully-virtual in a post-pandemic context.</p>
<p>The Expressable co-founders pointed toward consistency, both internally and externally, as a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>First, speech therapy is a recurring service that many patients use once a week, every month, for years. “A lot of other telemedicine plays are these quick, convenient, and direct primary care,” Barbara said. “[We are] a longer tail of treatment plan that requires a close relationship between provider and patient.”</p>
<p>Second, unlike many telehealth startups, Expressable has hired its specialists full-time as W-2 employees. It’s a strategic choice to help ensure to its clients that their SLP of choice is a long-term relationship. The startup has 50 W-2 SLPs currently.</p>

<p>“We have built a career path for SLPs and a value proposition to speech language pathologists where they can work from home, set their own hours [get] paid above the national average, and then receive benefits that may not be obviously not common if you&#8217;re working in a contractor position.”</p>
<p>Not relying on the traditional contractor model might be a differentiation, but it’s also a challenge. The startup will have to rapidly (and efficiently) hire SLPs for the variety of speaking conditions out there &#8211; and in order to expand into new markets, it has to go through the arduous legal process of local licensing requirements, instead of just going to a white-label solution that helps staff similar companies while offloading individual practitioner certification.</p>
<p>While it has ambitions to become a national practice, Expressable currently operates in 15 states, and employs SLPs that are licensed in all the states that it operates in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s widely known that video streaming boomed during the pandemic, as millions of people were faced by boredom during lockdowns. But an unintended consequence of this was the growing environmental impact of millions of video streams which meant server farms needing to draw increasing amounts of power from the grid. Indeed, there were even calls for people to cycle down to Standard Definition, as HD streaming has a greater impact. But it turns out that if you optimize the video, you can reduce the bitrate required, reducing the data and energy needed.</p>
<p>Oddly enough this is also the pitch of the famed satirical show, Silicon Valley, where fictional startup PiedPiper invents a new creates an app that contains a revolutionary data compression algorithm for video.</p>
<p>But this scenario may about to become fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.isize.co/">iSIZE</a>, UK startup which applies deep learning to optimize video streaming and delivery, has $6.3 million in a funding round led by Octopus Ventures, with participation from existing investors including TD Veen and Patrick Pichette, Chairman of Twitter and ex-CFO of Google. The company has now raised a total of $8.2 million.</p>
<p>iSIZE’s BitSave technology optimizes video streaming quality while reducing bitrate requirements, &#8220;allowing for a significant reduction in data and energy consumption&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is trained to ‘see with the human eye’ in order to n=make the video still look high quality, but reduce the bitrate needed. It integrates with all video encoding standards (including AVC, HEVC, and AV1) without needing changes to the streaming process. In other words, the links of Netflix, etc would, says the company, be able to install the iSize solution relatively easily.</p>
<p>Founded by Sergio Grce and Dr. Yiannis Andreopoulos, the team combines R&amp;D in machine learning, neural networks, and video signal processing, and is a graduate of the Creative Destruction Lab Oxford 2019-2020 program.</p>
<p>Sergio Grce, Founder and CEO of iSIZE, commented: “Today there are more people streaming more video than ever before. Our customers recognize both the commercial opportunity and their social responsibility to optimize their video delivery pipelines with our pioneering technology.”</p>
<p>On a call to me, he added: &#8220;The processing optimizes for human perception and tries to reverse engineer human perception of the receiver in a manner similar to psycho visual perception. So that saves bitrate and the content looks the same or better on the client device. We are doing something similar for video as what the MP3 did for music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon King, Partner and deep tech investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “The technology iSIZE has created is pioneering and is already being used by some of the world’s largest companies to reduce the costs and energy used in streaming. Consumer demand for high-quality video is only going to increase as our devices are upgraded, so it’s vital that we find new ways to reduce the environmental impact.”</p>
<p>iSIZE&#8217;s competitors include Wave 1 and Deep Render.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let&#8217;s remind ourselves of how good PiedPiper was at video compression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech investments in emerging markets have been in full swing over the past couple of years and their ecosystems have thrived as a result.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these markets like Africa, Latin America, and India, have comprehensive reports by publications and firms on trends and investments in their individual regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s hardly a report to compare and contrast trends and investments between these regions and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such a task is Herculean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, a <a href="https://bfaglobal.com/catalyst-fund/briter-catalyst-fund-state-of-the-fintech-industry-report/?utm_source=briter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=fintech_report">report</a> released today by data research organization </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and global inclusive tech accelerator </span><a href="https://bfaglobal.com/project/catalyst-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is punching above its weight to offer a holistic representation to the darling sector of these three markets: fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report &#8220;State of Fintech in Emerging Markets Report&#8221; has three objectives &#8212; to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the investment, product, and inclusivity trends across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team surveyed over 177 startups and 33 investors across Africa, Latin America, and India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though this sample size used is minuscule, the key findings are quite impressive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s dive in.</span></p>
<h2>Fintechs have raised $23B across the regions since 2017</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no stopping emerging markets&#8217; favorite. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sector has continued to receive the largest share of investments year-on-year for the past five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 300 million unbanked African adults account for 17% of the world&#8217;s unbanked population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s not difficult to see why in 2019, the continent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> five mega deals in Branch, Tala, World Remit, Interswitch, and OPay that amounted to a total of over $775 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this dropped last year to $362 million, companies like Flutterwave, TymeBank, Kuda have raised sizeable rounds during this period</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is home to a growing base of digital users, enabling regulation and reforms, and vibrant small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Africa, the percentage of unbanked people is high at 70%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs in the region have seized the opportunity and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been rewarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with mega-rounds that companies like NuBank, Neon, Konfio, and Clip have enjoyed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fintech startups have raised $10 billion in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019 alone, Indian fintech startups raised a record of $4.8 billion, per the report. Then last year, the sector brought in $3 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, they have totaled $11.6 billion with notable big names like CRED, Razorpay, Groww, BharatPe, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Africa&#8217;s average seed rounds stand at $1M, India and Latin America average $4M</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, early-stage deals in Africa have been increasing over the past five years totaling over $1.6 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Their average size, especially for seed rounds, has grown from $750,000 in 2017 to $1 million in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For  Latin America, the average seed deal in the last five years was around $5.7 million while India did approximately $4.6 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The report says the data for the latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was skewed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of CRED&#8217;s $30 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148378" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148378" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148378" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="336" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png 2165w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=768,380 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=1536,760 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=2048,1013 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Artboard-7@4x.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148378" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Briter Bridges &amp; Catalyst Fund</p></div></p>
<h2>Latin America is IPO-hungry, India breeds unicorns while Africa is just getting started with M&amp;A</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Stripe&#8217;s acquisition of Paystack was the highlight of Africa&#8217;s M&amp;As because of its size and the homegrown status of the Nigerian fintech startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other larger rounds that made the headlines include the $500 million acquisition of Wave by WorldRemit (which happens to be the largest from the continent) and the DPO Group buyout by Network International for $288 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the African fintech market that has noticed mega acquisition deals and many undisclosed seven-figure deals, the Latin American fintech market is a sucker for IPOs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, fintechs in the region have several $100 million rounds (Nubank, PagSeguro,  Creditas, BancoInter and Neon) and M&amp;A activity is sparse. But a number of them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have gone public recently including Arco Educacao, Stone Pagamentos, and Pagseguro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, India has more than 25 billion-dollar companies and keeps adding yearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month, the country recorded more than eight. These unicorns range from established companies like Paytm and new ones like CRED.</span></p>
<h2>Payments, credit, and neobanks lead fintech activity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report shows that payments companies are the crème de la crème for fintech investment across the three regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within that subset, B2B payments reign supreme. The next two funded fintech categories are credit and digital banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, payments startups have seen more investments than credit and neobanks. Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, Wave, Paystack, DPO come to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America most funded fintechs are neobanks. And it is the only region with all three product categories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded at $2-3 billion each. Some of these companies include NuBank, Creditas, and dLocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India&#8217;s top-funded fintech startups are in payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has notable representation in credit and neobanks, some of which have raised nine-figure rounds like Niyo, Lendingkart, and InCred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Investors are enthused<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>about the future of insurance, payments, and digital banks</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the handful of investors surveyed in the report on their view on future trends in fintech products 5 years from now, most of them chose insurance, payments, and digital banking models</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment platforms and embedded models are also areas of interest. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were less keen on agriculture and remittances while wealth tech platforms and neobanks were also ranked lower </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">priority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How is it that digital banking and neo-banking are at two ends of the spectrum of investor choice? I can&#8217;t say for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parts of the report talk about underserved consumers in these regions and how fintech startups are serving them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also discusses whether these fintech startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promote financial inclusion and what features and products would get them to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this, the glaring fact, which is no news, is that Africa is lagging years behind Latin America and India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking with Briter Bridges director Dario Giuliani, he pointed out that he&#8217;d lean on five years for the continent to get to where Latin America and India are at the moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that what makes India a better market at this stage is because it isn&#8217;t a continent like the other markets and operations are uniform across board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is easier to manage one country than 54 countries in Africa and 20 in Latin America,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch. &#8220;In Africa, we use the label &#8216;Africa,&#8217; but we&#8217;re very much talking about 4-6 countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin America is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia who are seeing massive companies rise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. India is one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key detail the report mentions is that most fintechs across emerging markets are crossing over to different sectors like crop insurance, credit lines for distributors and vendors, KYC, e-commerce payment gateways, medical finance, and insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Guiliani says he expects this to continue.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic has been good for anything it&#8217;s been good for the therapy business and for startups targeting mental health, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">VCs kept very busy signing checks</a>. To wit, here&#8217;s another one: Madrid-based <a href="https://ifeelonline.com/en/">ifeel</a> has bagged €5.5 million (~$6.6M) in Series A funding, led by Nauta Capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded back in 2017 &#8212; initially as a consumer-focused therapy platform &#8212; but last year it pivoted to a hybrid business model, tapping into demand from businesses to offer staff emotional support during the public health crisis. So it&#8217;s available both to individuals via monthly subscription or as part of employer’s or insurance provider’s cover</p>
<p>It says that pandemic pivot has resulted in 1,000% growth in its b2b business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies it&#8217;s signed up to offer its platform to their staff include AXA Partners, Glovo and Gympass.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a total of 400K users on the platform (b2c and b2b),&#8221; says co-founder Amir Kaplan. &#8220;We have 100,000 eligible covered who have access to ifeel as a benefit (through our insurance and wellness partners or direct with ifeel).</p>
<p>&#8220;The 100K grew 10x from September 2020 and is the largest trend we are experiencing these days. Employees of 100 companies use ifeel on a weekly basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>ifeel&#8217;s platform delivers both live therapy sessions with licensed psychologists but also provides users with self-care tool such as daily mood trackers, recommended exercises and activities to expand the support available.</p>
<p>&#8220;By combining self-care and guided therapies, <span class="il">ifeel</span> maximises engagement and retention of its users &#8212; with 90% reporting improved emotional and mental well-being after using <span class="il">ifeel</span>,&#8221; it claims.</p>
<p>The startup is using AI technology in the self-care portion of its platform &#8212; to recommend &#8220;the most relevant&#8221; content or exercise to its users, per Kaplan. But he also says it&#8217;s looking at using the tech to assist the therapist practice by developing dedicated tools inside the platform.</p>
<p>ifeel has an international founding team, hailing from three countries (Israel, Italy and Mexico), and says its main markets so far are Spain, France, Brazil and Mexico. While its b2b and insurance network coverage extends to 20 countries and four languages (English, Spanish, French and Portuguese).</p>
<p>With so much competition in the mental health tools space &#8212; from mindfulness apps, to internet-delivered CBT programs, to therapy platforms &#8212; how does ifeel see itself standing out?</p>
<p>Kaplan suggests it has an advantage of being &#8220;global from day one&#8221;, and also flags a &#8220;strong technology integration focus&#8221; which he says has allowed it to plug into insurance companies and wellness players &#8212; to become a &#8220;main service provider&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very early we partnered with global leading companies and we support them in many countries (compared to specific country players like in Germany and UK,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The platform approach is different from &#8216;online therapy&#8217; companies or &#8216;mindfulness apps&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want our users to manage their emotional well being on our platform no matter the need. In this way we create millions of engagement events that are customized to the user’s needs and allow users over time to use different parts of our platform in different life situations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">survey</a> European founders and investors in cities <em>outside</em> the larger European capitals.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will ask entrepreneurs in these cities to talk about their ecosystems, in their own words.</p>
<p><strong>This is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put <strong>Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen</strong> on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>If you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out the survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We are particularly interested in hearing from women founders and investors.</p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in Europe&#8217;s biggest capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or DM on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>
