										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cent.co/">Cent</a> was founded in 2017 as an ad-free creator network that allows users to offer each other crypto rewards for good posts and comments &#8212; it&#8217;s like gifting awards on Reddit, but with Ethereum. But in late 2020, Cent&#8217;s small, San Fransisco-based team created <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables</a>, an NFT market for tweets, and by March, the small blockchain startup was thrown a serendipitous curveball.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just wrapped up for the day, and I was about to go eat dinner, and all these people started texting me,&#8221; remembers CEO Cameron Hejazi. Then, he realized that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had minted Twitter&#8217;s first ever Tweet through Cent&#8217;s Valuables application. &#8220;I was basically like, mildly shivering for the rest of the night. The whole team, we were like, &#8216;Okay, battle stations, prepare to get hacked!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey ended up <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/twitter-ceo-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-sells-for-2point9-million.html">selling his NFT</a> for $2.9 million, and he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1374071729467707394">donated</a> the proceeds to Give Directly&#8217;s Africa Response fund for COVID-19 relief. But for Cent, it was as if the small company had just been handed a free marketing campaign. Now, about five months later, Cent is announcing a $3 million round of seed funding with investors like Galaxy Interactive, former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, Will.I.Am, and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables</a>, anyone on the internet can place an offer on any tweet, which then makes it possible for someone else to make a counter-offer. If the author of the tweet accepts an offer (logging into Valuables requires you to validate your Twitter account), then Cent will mint the tweet on the blockchain and create a 1-of-1 NFT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The NFT itself contains the text of the tweet, the username of the creator, the time it was minted, and the creator&#8217;s digital signature. The NFT also includes a link to the tweet, though the linked content lives outside the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185667" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185667" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/centdorseytweet.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.cent.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cent <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing proprietary about minting tweets as NFTs &#8212; another company could do the same thing that Cent is doing. Even Twitter itself has recently dabbled in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">giving away free NFT art</a>, though it hasn&#8217;t tried to sell actual tweets as NFTs like Cent. Still, Hejazi sees Dorsey&#8217;s use of Cent like an endorsement &#8212; he thinks it would be difficult for Twitter to shut them down, since Dorsey made $2.9 million on the platform himself. After all, Dorsey chose Cent instead of taking a screenshot of his first tweet, minting the .JPG as an NFT, and posting it on a larger NFT platform, like OpenSea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spoken with people at Twitter. I&#8217;m positive that we have a healthy relationship going,&#8221; Hejazi said (Twitter declined to comment on or confirm whether that&#8217;s true). &#8220;We thought about applying this approach to other social platforms, like Instagram and TikTok, but we hypothesized that this is particularly suited for Twitter, because it&#8217;s a conversation platform, and it&#8217;s where all of the crypto people are actually living.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Cent&#8217;s seed funding Hejazi hopes to continue building the platform. The company&#8217;s goal is to enable anyone creative to make an income through the use of NFTs &#8212; that means developing tools to make it simpler for its users to mint NFTs, but also, building out its existing creator-focused social network. The content people post on Cent is usually creative work, like art and writing, rather than short posts &#8212; it&#8217;s closer to DeviantArt than it is to Reddit. These are lofty goals for a $3 million seed funding round, but there are aspects of Cent&#8217;s <a href="https://beta.cent.co/~discover/">Beta</a> platform that make it promising.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s already value in what we post on social media. It&#8217;s just being proxied through ad dollars, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be the case that there&#8217;s so much wealth concentration in a single entity. We can work toward a system that decentralizes that wealth,&#8221; said Hejazi. &#8220;These networks as they exist have monopolies on distribution &#8212; you can&#8217;t take your Twitter audience, download it as a .CSV, and send them all an email.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185671" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185671" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2185671" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png 2868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=1536,754 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=2048,1005 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-04-at-1.14.35-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185671" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of Cent&#8217;s social platform.</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to independent distribution lists, Hejazi wants to move away from the ad-supported internet. He references <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">Substack</a> as an example of a company where the creator has control of their list, and at the same time, the platform can remain ad-free, since the money that propels it comes from the users who pay to subscribe to newsletters (and also, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/substack-confirms-65m-raise-promises-to-rapidly-expand-its-financial-backing-of-newly-independent-writers/">venture capital</a> helps).</p>
<p>But Cent does something different by allowing users to essentially invest in creators who they think have the potential to take off on their platform.</p>
<p>Users can &#8220;seed&#8221; a post, which is how you subscribe to a creator participating <a href="https://www.cent.co/#Beta">on the creatives side of Cent&#8217;s platform</a>. As the seeder, you pay a set fee of at least one dollar per month. There&#8217;s an incentive to support up-and-coming creators on the platform, because seeders get a portion of the creators&#8217; future profit &#8212; it&#8217;s like making a bet on them that they will continue to make great content in the future. Five percent of profits go toward Cent, but the remaining 95% is split 50/50 between the creator and all of their past seeders. Participating on this platform would allow creators to network and show support for one another, but doesn&#8217;t prevent them from more directly monetizing their work on other creator platforms, like Patreon.</p>
<p>In addition to seeding posts, users can also &#8220;spot&#8221; other people&#8217;s posts &#8212; Cent&#8217;s version of a &#8220;like&#8221; button. Each &#8220;spot&#8221; is the equivalent of one cent from the user&#8217;s crypto wallet. Cent&#8217;s argument is that getting 1,000 likes on a post on other platforms yields nothing but a vague sensation of social clout. But on Cent, if a user gets 1,000 &#8220;spots,&#8221; that&#8217;s $10. Still, a project like this can only work if enough people use the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started Cent, we chose cryptocurrencies because we loved the idea of someone being able to earn money with nothing more than their creativity and a crypto address,&#8221; Hejazi said. &#8220;Over time, we&#8217;ve found it to be limiting as a payment type &#8212; very few people actually own it and have it ready to spend. We&#8217;re working on ways to make payments to creators using Cent easier, and are exploring both crypto-native and non-crypto options.&#8221;</p>
<p>This mindset echoes other NFT startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/yat-thinks-emoji-identities-can-be-a-thing-and-it-has-20m-in-sales-to-back-it-up/">Yat</a>, which allows payments via credit card as part of its &#8220;progressive decentralization&#8221; model. So much of these companies&#8217; success depends on public buy-in toward an eventual decentralized, blockchain-based internet. But until then, companies like Cent will continue to experiment in reimagining how creatives can get paid online.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the pandemic, especially when we were in lock down, just about every retailer had to build its online presence and do it quickly. As people move to shop online in larger numbers, being able to personalize that experience has become more crucial. That made the pandemic a pivotal moment for <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, an e-commerce personalization platform, and today the company announced a $125 million Series E on a $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Existing investor Georgian led the round with participation from other existing investors FirstMark and Norwest along with new investor Silver Lake Waterman. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $225 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Up until fairly recently, Bluecore CEO and co-founder Fayez Mohamood says that retail outreach was mostly about driving traffic to brick and mortar stores or to the company website, but as more business gets conducted online, it has changed how brands have to interact with their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in that shift, and Bluecore is a retail-specific, multi-channel personalization platform, and we combine basically three types of data. First is customer identity. Second is shopper behavior. And then thirdly and most importantly, the product catalog of a retailer, and using that we drive personalized experiences on various channels,&#8221; Mohamood explained.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2013, and has been able to evolve the notion of personalization since then in a significant way. Mohamood says the pandemic really pushed things into the digital realm where his company&#8217;s strength lies and that&#8217;s one of the primary reasons they are taking on this funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personalization has always been important, but I think the value retailers can derive from it has dramatically accelerated as digital became a bigger and bigger portion of everybody&#8217;s revenue stream. And over the last year, that became even more critical,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Boost ROI with intent data and personalized multichannel marketing campaigns&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/boost-roi-with-intent-data-and-personalized-multichannel-marketing-campaigns/embed/#?secret=hz5vTELACZ" data-secret="hz5vTELACZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As the company&#8217;s growth has accelerated so has the hiring. In May 2020 Bluecore had 236 employees, today it has over 300 and it&#8217;s shooting to be over 400 by the end of the year. He says that as he grows the company, diversity and inclusion is a crucial component to have the employee base reflect the diversity of the customers they serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;It starts with the executive team, so I&#8217;m extremely proud of the fact that on our executive team close to half our team is female. We have a committee that is represented by the core employees that is a diversity, equity and inclusion committee where we have thoughts and ideas and most most importantly actions on how we can build a better diverse, inclusive workplace. And that translates it into OKRs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As a Series E company with a billion dollar valuation, Mohamood can see becoming a public company at some point, but it is not an immediate goal as he pursues growth over profitability. &#8220;The way we think about it is we have this brand that&#8217;s going to help us invest in our product capabilities, our leadership capabilities, and our go-to-market capabilities to build something that has the ability to [be a public company some day]. Having said that, we&#8217;re pursuing growth and if that&#8217;s the goal, we find that staying private helps us do that,&#8221; he said. And with $125 million of runway, the company plenty of freedom to take its time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more people dust off their luggage and passports after stowing them away during the global pandemic, <a href="https://elude.co/">Elude</a> aims to show travelers a new way to take spontaneous trips.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based startup launched its travel discovery mobile app Thursday, a budget-first search engine that shows people how far their money will take them. The platform’s personalized onboarding experience customizes trip packages and offers future travel suggestions based on those preferences.</p>
<p>The idea for the company came three years ago from Alex Simon, CEO, and Frankie Scerbo, CMO, who met in college and bonded over their love of traveling and would do so together any time they had a long weekend. One New Year’s they tried planning a trip, but everything was too expensive. Not being able to find something on their budget, they came up with the idea for Elude.</p>
<p>Rather than searching by destination, Elude gathers information like budget, time frame and trip preferences (think beach versus mountains), then presents users with flight and hotel results for destinations they may never have thought existed or could be traveled to on their budgets.</p>
<p>The company taps into the same flight and hotel databases that all online travel companies use that store hundreds of thousands of flights and hotels and only suggests hotels with 3.5 stars and above.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185849" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Elude_PressKit_12.gif" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185849" class="wp-caption-text">Elude app</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders have now raised $2.1 million in seed funding led by a group of investors including Mucker Capital, Unicorn Ventures, Upfront Scout Fund, StartupO, Grayson Capital and Flight VC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Erik Rannala, co-founder and managing partner at Mucker Capital, initially invested in Elude, it was before the global pandemic. However, he sees travel getting back to normal, though with flights now more expensive than before, more people are looking for travel deals, something that wasn’t being addressed until Elude came along.</p>
<p>Travel is “a massive category,” with most people in either “look mode” or “book mode,” with the money only being made in book mode, Rannala said. By taking a budget-first approach, Elude is bridging people from look mode to book mode more quickly.</p>
<p>“The way they have done it is to help people discover something new based on their budget that is available to book right now,” he added. “It’s a unique way to solve the problem and to give people a good deal.”</p>
<p>With millenials spending over<a href="https://www.thewanderingrv.com/millennials-travel-statistics/"> $200 billion annually</a> on travel, Elude’s goal is to reduce the hours of scrolling in search of a trip and more time actively booking vacations. Whereas competitors may show flights only or hotels only, Elude produces flight and hotel packages.</p>
<p>“In just a few clicks, we can show you, for example, that you could go to Barcelona for the same price as Miami,” Scerbo told TechCrunch. “If you knew that kind of information, you would take a better trip. This opens doors to taking a trip every few months instead of the one or two trips a year most people take.”</p>
<p>Prior to today, Elude was in private beta mode where the company had amassed some 40,000 people on the waitlist. Simon said.</p>
<p>Elude plans to use the funding to advance technology, marketing function, operations and customer support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608507/google-leaks-unannounced-nest-camera-doorbell-online-store">leak</a> didn’t leave much to the imagination. And today’s big Nest reveal confirms pretty much everything we saw — which is precisely what happens when Google’s the one doing the leaking. Still, this morning’s announcement marks one of the biggest refreshes to Google’s home security line in recent memory, with updates to various configurations of Nest’s security cam and doorbell.</p>
<p>Depending on how you count, Google’s announcing up to four devices today. The list includes: the Google Nest Cam battery, Google Nest Doorbell ($180, each), the $280 Google Nest Cam with floodlight and the $100 Google Nest Cam.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185884" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185884" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185884" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=1536,1229 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=2048,1638 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-cam-Wired-Sand-with-maple-wood-base-5x4-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The Nest Cams feature a design that looks a bit like they stepped out of some Pixar movie. The $100 basic Nest Cam is a second-gen wired device, designed for indoor-use only. The $180 model, meanwhile, adds battery power and waterproofing, making it suitable for either indoor or outdoor use.</p>
<p>The company says it should get around three months of battery life on a charge, assuming your home has an average of nine to 12 recorded “events” a day. The numbers obviously fluctuate a fair bit, depending on how much action your house sees on a typical day. The AI/ML is trained to record specific activities, triggered by things like people, animals or package deliveries, depending on the setting.</p>

<p>“Building a camera that uses ML to recognize objects requires showing the ML model millions of images first,” Google writes in<a href="http://blog.google/new-google-nest-latest-cams-and-doorbells-are-here"> a blog post</a>. &#8220;Our new Nest Cameras and Doorbells have been trained on 40 million images to accommodate lots of different environments and lighting conditions. Thanks to a cutting edge TPU chip, our new cameras run an ML model up to 7.5 times per second, so reliability and accuracy are even better. 3. Works in any home: Nest Cam and Doorbell’s wire-free design.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2185882" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185882" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nest-Doorbell-battery-Snow-lifestyle-A-5x4-1.jpeg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185882" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>I quite like the new streamlined design for the doorbell. Being battery powered means you can install it without having to futz with wiring. Without direct access to a hardwired chime, you can configure to ring through connected Google devices like Nest speakers and smart displays. Unlike the wired Nest Hello (which Google is keeping on the market), the new doorbell doesn’t offer continuous recording, owing to battery constraints. It should give you around three months of use, on average.</p>
<p>The new nest devices are up for preorder today in 18 countries and will go on sale August 24.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://statsig.com">Statsig</a> is taking the A/B testing applications that drive Facebook’s growth and putting similar functionalities into the hands of any product team so that they, too, can make faster, data-informed decisions on building products customers want.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company on Thursday announced $10.4 million in Series A funding, led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from Madrona Venture Group and a group of individual investors, including Robinhood CPO Aparna Chennapragada, Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, DoorDash exec Gokul Rajaram, Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi and a16z general partner Sriram Krishnan.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Vijaye Raji started the company with seven other former Facebook colleagues in February, but the idea for the company started more than a year ago.</p>
<p>He told TechCrunch that while working at Facebook, A/B testing applications, like Gatekeeper, Quick Experiments and Deltoid, were successfully built internally. The Statsig team saw an opportunity to rebuild these features from scratch outside of Facebook so that other companies that have products to build — but no time to build their own quick testing capabilities — can be just as successful.</p>
<p>Statsig’s platform enables product developers to run quick product experiments and analyze how users respond to new features and functionalities. Tools like Pulse, Experiments+ and AutoTune allow for hundreds of experiments every week, while business metrics guide product teams to build and ship the right products to their customers.</p>
<p>Raji intends to use the new funding to hire folks in the area of design, product, data science, sales and marketing. The team is already up to 14 since February.</p>
<p>“We already have a set of customers asking for features, and that is a good problem, but now we want to scale and build them out,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Statsig has no subscription or upfront fees and is already serving millions of end-users every month for customers like Clutter, Common Room and Take App. The company will always offer a free tier so customers can try out features, but also offers a Pro tier for 5 cents per event so that when the customer grows, so does Statsig.</p>
<p>Raji sees adoption of Statsig coming from a few different places: developers and engineers that are downloading it and using it to serve a few million people a month, and then through referrals. In fact, the adoption the company is getting is “bottom up,” which is what Statsig wants, he said. Now the company is talking to bigger customers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of competitors for this product, including incumbents in the market, according to Raji, but they mostly focus on features, while Statsig provides insights and ties metrics back to features. In addition, the company has automated analysis where other products require manual set up and analysis.</p>
<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal worked at Facebook prior to joining the venture capital firm and had worked with Raji, calling him “a top 1% engineer” that he was happy to work with.</p>
<p>Having sat on many company boards, he has found that many companies spend a long time talking about sales and marketing, but very little on product because there is not an easy way to get precise numbers for planning purposes, just a discussion about what they did and plan to do.</p>
<p>What Vernal said he likes about Statsig is that the company is bringing that measurement aspect to the table so that companies don’t have to hack together a poorer version.</p>
<p>“What Statsig can do, uniquely, is not only set up an experiment and tell if someone likes green or blue buttons, but to answer questions like what the impact this is of the experiment on new user growth, retention and monitorization,” he added. “That they can also answer holistic questions and understand the impact on any single feature on every metric is really novel and not possible before the maturation of the data stack.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Emily Elyse Miller, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eatofflimits.com/">OffLimits</a>, launching during a global pandemic was “interesting to navigate,” but in the end, worked out.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, ‘fun cereal’ is associated with being unhealthy, and I wanted people to have fun with their food again, but in a healthy way,” Miller told TechCrunch. “There are a few startups in the space tackling the healthy side of cereal, but I wanted to take on the culture of breakfast.”</p>
<p>She split her time between fashion and food, attending the Fashion Institute of Technology before getting into the trends and forecasting space. It was there that she started writing about food and design, traveling all over the world. She said she “became obsessed with morning rituals” and worked with chefs to open their doors for breakfast. She even <a href="https://emilyelysemiller.com/">wrote a book on breakfast</a>.</p>
<p>Miller launched OffLimits in 2020 out of <a href="http://science-inc.com/">Science Inc.</a>’s startup studio. OffLimits uses whole ingredients, and its flavors are organic, vegan, gluten-free and lightly-sweetened with organic cane sugar. Since its launch, OffLimits’ two cereals Dash (turns your milk into cold brew coffee) and Zombie (Pandan-flavored, similar to vanilla) were picked up in stores like Intelligentsia and are available online. The cereals retail for $8.50 per box.</p>
<p>She is now announcing a $2.3 million round of funding that encompasses friends and family, pre-seed and seed financing. The backing comes from Science Inc., Crosslink, Canaan, DBC Creative CEO Dana Cowin, Surface Magazine CEO Marc Lotenberg, TikTok executive Nick Tran and NTWRK president Moksha Fitzgibbons.</p>
<p>Miller said the breakfast market was valued at $16 billion in the U.S. and $30 billion globally. Building a cereal brand is capital-intensive and difficult to produce, so the new funding will go toward scaling into retail, hiring new talent and building up inventory.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, new brands like OffLimits have popped up, offering legacy brands a chance to pivot to new audiences, but largely they have not, she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There is definitely room to grow and with the Gen Z mindset of questioning legacy brands, we want to support what is new,” Miller said. “We are one of the few that are all plant-based, which was both a disturbing and surprising fact to find out. It was really important that OffLimits had an extremely clean panel. We want something all chefs can be excited about.”</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company released new flavors, including Spark (strawberry flavor with antioxidants) and Flex, which has a cinnamon flavor and is targeted toward a health and workout-oriented audience. To commemorate the company’s first year in business, it is offering a “birthday pack” so that customers can try all four flavors. Miller heard from customers that they like mixing cereal flavors, so the pack will encourage personalization. There is also an edible glitter product launching in September that Miller said “turns the cereal bowl into a disco party.”</p>
<p>Products sold out twice already and the company is now on its third production, with plans to offer mini boxes, where the milk can be poured directly in, and optimizing the supply chain for future growth.</p>
<p>Aside from the flavors, Miller wanted a focus on the boxes themselves and the mascots for each one. The cereal mascots all have profiles on the website and include a female pink bunny for Dash and a zombie that eats cereal all day.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to impart anything on the characters, and want to keep them open to be molded into different things,” Miller added. “We want to appeal to counter-cultures in whatever sense that is.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indoor growing industry is starting to scale. Farms that utilize hydroponics (grow produce without soil, usually in large warehouses) and traditional greenhouses have started to become integral parts of our food supply chain, mainly for leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and arugula.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vertical hydroponic farming is often seen as a sustainable alternative to traditional growing. It uses 95% less water, has less impact on soil and the urban farms can be placed in food deserts or close to grocers to cut down on transportation costs. But the </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/indoor-soilless-farming-phase-i-examining-the-industry-and-impacts-of-controlled-environment-agriculture"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-energy usage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for lighting the indoor farms has often thwarted cutting down on carbon emissions from agriculture.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry leader </span><a href="https://www.aerofarms.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AeroFarms</span></a> <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/aerofarms-to-go-public-with-merger-valued-at-12-billion-with-spac-spring-valley-acquisition-2021-03-26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s going public sometime this year. </span><a href="https://www.plenty.ag/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SF-based vertical farm company, </span><a href="https://www.plenty.ag/article/plenty-expands-into-17-new-safeway-stores-across-northern-california"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into 17 Safeways across Northern California. </span><a href="https://www.gothamgreens.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gotham Greens,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the East Coast urban farming business, is pushing past the COVID-19 recession and building indoor farms in geographies like </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasyu/2020/05/20/gotham-greens-opens-new-greenhouse-in-colorado-as-local-businesses-slowly-reopen-after-covid-19-pause/?sh=5792b7954faa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2021/03/01/gotham-greens-greenhouse-uc-davis.html?cx_testId=40&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_39&amp;cx_artPos=0&amp;s=print"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Overall, the global vertical farming market is expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-vertical-farming-market-to-reach-5-8-billion-by-2026--301323466.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.8 billion by 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a compound annual growth rate of 14%. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Canadian-based startup </span><a href="https://us.justvertical.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is working to add home gardeners to the indoor growing movement. Its two products, the Aeva and the Eve, are marketed as elegant pieces of furniture that can grow between eight and 10 pounds of food a month using hydroponic technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The products use a wooden cabinet as the base, and the growing mechanism extends upward about five feet. The Aeva and the Eve can grow leafy greens, zucchini, strawberries, herbs, peppers and cucumbers. The company is currently expanding into flowers and it even grew hops for microbreweries. Beyond selling the hardware, Just Vertical offers a subscription model for its seeds and peat moss pods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s meant for anyone that can’t grow either all year round or doesn’t have the capability without a backyard or a balcony,” co-founder Kevin Jakiela said. “We didn&#8217;t want to be just another countertop version.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those countertop competitors include </span><a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click and Grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.aerogarden.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aerogardens</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which are mainly used for herbs. But larger competitors do exist, like </span><a href="https://www.towergarden.com/shop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tower Garden </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://zipgrow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZipGrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Just Vertical is trying to be both décor and garden in a way these other versions are not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jakiela, the company’s biggest markets are condos and homes, followed by restaurants, schools, cafes and bars. The company is also picking up interest in office space as décor rather than just truly food-focused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be an amenity in condominiums or houses &#8212; part of the pre-builds. Kind of like where you could choose your type of dishwasher and washing machine &#8212; we want to be the next microwave equivalent,” Jakiela said. “Also get into large retailers like IKEA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has sold 1,500 units and has seed investment from District Ventures, the fund from Arlene Dickinson (a “shark” on Canada’s version of Shark Tank called Dragon’s Den). The company is currently aiming for a Series A this September. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2185754,2185753,2185752"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical’s high price point, between $600 and $1,000, makes it unlikely it will really make a difference for families that struggle with food security or even a huge impact on environmental concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jakiela acknowledged that right now the target consumer is “a Whole Foods shopper.” But the website still touts data citing the environmental benefits of the products, including more than 112,000,000 miles of food transport saved and over 2,000,000 liters of water saved due to people growing their own food. But Jakiela hopes that, as the company scales, it can really start to make a social and business impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be able to go away from the hobbyist and go for more impact,” he said. “Like a restaurant where they can truly offset some of their costs by using an Aeva, we want to be more front-facing in grocery stores. Build out our retail and distributed network, targeting the social piece of things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Vertical decided that starting on the high-end consumer side would help them prove market fit and be able to go to grocery stores with proven success to really make an impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very difficult, especially as a startup, to go knocking on any grocery store’s door and say ‘hey, we have an idea for you,” he said. “They say ‘get out of here, come back with sales, come back with validation’ or you’re in a loop of an eight to 12-month process with no guarantees. There’s a lot of hoops to go through. [Grocers] don’t want to be first. But they don’t want to be last at the same time.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/checkmarx/">Checkmarx</a>, an Israeli provider of static application security testing (AST), has acquired open-source supply chain security startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dustico">Dustico</a> for an undisclosed sum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Dustico provides a dynamic source-code analysis platform that employs machine learning to detect malicious attacks and backdoors in software supply chains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition will see Checkmarx combine its AST capabilities with Dustico’s behavioral analysis technology to give customers a consolidated view into the risk and reputation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/">open-source</a> packages, and as a result, a more comprehensive approach to preventing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/">supply chain attacks</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The deal comes amid a sharp rise in supply chain attacks, in which threat actors slip malicious code into a trusted piece of software or hardware. Last December, it was revealed that Russian hackers had breached software firm SolarWinds to plant malicious code in its IT management tool Orion. This allowed the hackers — later identified as Russia&#8217;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) — to access as many as 18,000 networks that used the Orion software.</p>
<p>Dustico’s technology, which is similar to that offered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sonatype/">Sonatype</a>, analyses open source packages using a three-pronged approach. First, it factors in trust, providing visibility into the credibility of package providers and individual contributors in the open-source community, and then it examines the health of packages to determine their level of maintenance. Finally, Dustico’s advanced behavioral analysis engine inspects the package and looks for malicious attacks hiding within including backdoors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, multi-stage attacks, and trojans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This insight, coupled with vulnerability results from Checkmarx’s AST solutions, aims to give organizations and developers greater insights for managing the risks associated with open-source and the supply chains dependent on them, according to the two companies.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to welcome Dustico and its team to Checkmarx as the Israeli tech ecosystem continues to push the boundaries of cybersecurity innovation and talent,” said Emmanuel Benzaquen, CEO of Checkmarx.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Blending Dustico’s differentiated approach to open-source analysis with Checkmarx’s security testing capabilities will bring disruptive value to our customers as they manage the challenges with securing software supply chains.”</p>
<p>The acquisition of Dustico comes after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/insight-partners-sells-security-firm-checkmarx-to-hellman-friedman-for-1-15b/">Checkmarx was bought by private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman</a> at a valuation of $1.15 billion in March 2020. Prior to this, in 2015, the company was sold to Insight Partners with an $84 million investment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's platform enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telehealth company Lucid Lane raised $16 million in Series A funding to continue developing its platform that enables real-time intervention for people with medication dependence and substance-use disorders.</p>
<p>Adnan Asar, co-founder and CEO of Lucid Lane, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/">started the company five years ago</a> after watching his wife struggle to stop taking medication she was prescribed following an illness.</p>
<p>There are 40 million people prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines each year, many like Asar’s wife, after surgery or in conjunction with cancer treatment to address acute and chronic pain as well as co-occurring mental health challenges, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>However, though the medications work well, out of the number of people prescribed, about 15 million people will continue to use the medication after the prescription runs out. This leads to ballooning healthcare costs with the healthcare system spending $150 billion annually to take care of this population, Asar said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lucid Lane has developed a service to get patients off of pain meds and avoid dependence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/lucid-lane-has-developed-a-service-to-get-patients-off-of-pain-meds-and-avoid-addiction/embed/#?secret=rB9s6ve1NB" data-secret="rB9s6ve1NB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lucid Lane’s latest services are aimed toward avoidance of becoming a persistent medication user or addict. They include comprehensive medication taper management for those dependent on opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol and nicotine, and a medication assisted treatment designed for patients diagnosed with opioid and alcohol substance disorders. The evidence-based treatments are available in more than 25 states.</p>
<p>Its technology utilizes web and mobile-based applications to provide remote patient monitoring and connection to dedicated therapists on a daily basis. A newly developed analytics engine collects health signals from patients to measure symptoms like anxiety, depression, pain levels and withdrawal effects so that the platform and therapists can personalize their treatments. If needed, the engine will connect patients instantly with an on-call counselor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over 90% of Lucid Lane patients who start medication tapering safely taper off, while members who are persistent opioid or benzodiazepine users tapered by 50% in six months after they started the process, which is better than Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Asar said. Patients also reported improvements in pain, emotional well-being and quality of life.</p>
<p>The Series A funding comes one year after the Los Altos-based company secured $4 million in a seed round. Accel Partners led the Series A and was joined by Battery Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures and strategic angel investors. As part of the investment, Eric Wolford, venture partner at Accel, joined the Lucid Lane board of directors.</p>
<p>Asar wasn’t planning for the Series A until later this year, but as the healthcare world was changing around him, venture capital firms began knocking on his door asking when he was raising the next round.</p>
<p>“I met Eric through Battery Ventures, and we had tremendous alignment with passion and mission and it seemed a great fit,” Asar said.</p>
<p>Wolford said he recognized how big of a problem opioid addiction was, that it was a worthy cause, and the size of the market opportunity. “There is something beyond the returns that is compelling, the extent of the problem and the awareness that exists already,” he added.</p>
<p>He also felt that Asar and his team knew the healthcare system and how to introduce technology into it. He mentioned that the industry is complicated to interface with due the complex nature of payers, providers, patients and regulations from state to state. He said that Lucid Lane was embracing the system and working with it.</p>
<p>Wolford was also attracted to the personalized nature of the company’s approach and that it can become the standard of care, taking the pressure off of doctors who want to do right by their patients, but want to prescribe less medication so they don’t become dependent.</p>
<p>“It’s a pressure release value so doctors are appropriately prescribing drugs, are accommodating patients and also providing an intervention to avoid the bad that may start,” he added. “Personalization is what doesn’t exist in healthcare right now, and will help get a person to a state of wholeness and encouragement while also progressing them when they are ready.”</p>
<p>Indeed, things are moving quickly for Lucid Lane. As with the healthcare industry itself, the global pandemic helped adoption of the company’s telehealth platform surge as remote care became more mandatory than a discretionary feature. In addition, Asar said it would have normally taken two years for the company to get into Medicare, but with the government’s updated regulations around telehealth, Lucid Lane is now nationwide with Medicare.</p>
<p>The company has a team of more than 40 therapists across 30 states and will be using the new funding to drive its commercial growth, including building up its sales, business development and product development teams. In addition to a leadership team with experience across the technology spectrum, Lucid Lane also announced that Beau Norgeot, former Anthem clinical AI executive, is joining the company as its chief data officer.</p>
<p>The company is also engaged in peer-reviewed, evidence-based, clinical trials at academic institutions, including Stanford University, the United States Veteran Affairs System and The University of Texas Health System.</p>
<p>“We are the only company addressing the whole spectrum of dependent patients and addicted patients,” Asar said. “Doctors don’t have the time or capability to do this, so we work with them to set a goal for patients to improve their quality of life and reduce their pain.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Latin America<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/"> attracts record-breaking venture capital totals,</a> education technology startups in the region are given new opportunities to grow. In the past week, Coderhouse, a live cohort-based learning platform, and Crehana, an on-demand skills development service for the enterprise, both announced financing rounds.</p>
<p>The back-to-back raises are a reminder that edtech’s relevance in LatAm isn’t just growing in classrooms, but also within organizations across LatAm. It&#8217;s a sign that both consumers and employers believe in the importance of reskilling in today&#8217;s new, ever-changing future of work.</p>
<h2>Broad but better</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://www.coderhouse.com/">Coderhouse</a>, founded in 2014 by Christian Patiño, is a platform for LatAm professionals to take live, online cohort-based courses in topics such as data, coding, design and marketing.</span></p>
<p>Patiño explained how the original online education platforms, also known as MOOCs, are “super accessible,” with low completion rates. The response to this then became boot camps, which he deems are “way more effective” but inaccessible due to low acceptance rates and high costs. With both sides of the spectrum in mind, he wants Coderhouse to sit somewhere in the middle, combining the affordability of MOOCs (massive open online course providers) and the engagement of bootcamps.</p>
<p>At $100 per course, Coderhouse offers small-group classes led by instructors and teacher assistants, with curriculum designed through partnerships with top companies.</p>
<p>The company announced this week that it has raised a $13.5 million Series A round led by Monashees, along with Reach Capital, David Velez from Nubank, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, Hugo Barra (former head of VR at Facebook) and the founders of Loggi, Rappi, Wildlife Studios, Méliuz, MadeiraMadeira, Cornershop, Bitso, Casai, Clara, RunaHR and Belvo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Coderhouse’s first venture capital check after bootstrapping for years. Since 2019, Coderhouse has grown revenue 10x year over year, and has reached a $12 million run-rate. Now, with formal backing, the founders are focused on growing that total by offering more services in Latin America. Patiño said that 80% of their revenue comes from Argentina, and the capital resources will help them grow their 21,000 student base to other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The startup serves a variety of students, including people who are looking for new jobs, people who want to get promoted within their current companies and entrepreneurs and freelancers who want to master a business-imperative skill such as marketing or copywriting. The broadness in early adopters could make it hard for the company to provide outcomes at scale &#8212; someone looking to be promoted has very different needs than someone who is looking for a new job &#8212; but for now, it’s helping the early-stage company find its voice.</p>
<p>The round was the first LatAm investment for Reach Capital, a U.S.-based edtech firm. Partner Esteban Sosnik explained how Coderhouse’s strategy is a response to LatAm’s talent bottleneck, as digital momentum in the region continues and roles change. He believes the broadness of Coderhouse’s offering makes it “tough to define one definition for outcomes.”</p>
<p>Sosnik thinks that graduation rates are a good proxy for impact and student satisfaction. So far, 90% of users who pay for Coderhouse graduate from their course, and of that cohort, 80% of students claim that salaries increase post-graduation. Down the road, he could see Coderhouse offering more data on the long-term economic impact of how taking a course can impact job trajectory two to four years down the line.</p>

<p>The company has no filters that limit students from taking courses, so it maintains quality by rigorous vetting of teachers. The founder estimates that only 8% of teachers are accepted to teach on Coderhouse’s platform, resulting in nearly 2,000 active teachers with the company today.</p>
<p>A challenge for the startup will be scaling its teacher assistant [TA] to student ratio. Right now, there are 20 students to one TA, and Patiño wants to introduce more peer-to-peer work and grading to limit how labor intensive a class is for instructors.</p>
<p>As Coderhouse figures out how to be an affordable bootcamp for aspiring and current employees, Crehana is finding its stride in going straight to the companies that employ them.</p>
<h2><strong>Centralize it all</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.crehana.com/">Crehana</a> is a one-stop shop for employers to retrain their employees. Where it goes niche in clientele focus, it goes broad in services: It wants to do the “entire value chain” of learning, from assessing skill gaps to offering content to address weak spots to tracking progress. Right now, there are more than 400 instructors/mentors that teach over 700 courses across 100,000 techniques and competencies needed for jobs.</p>
<p>Crehana announced today that it has raised a $70 million Series B just months after a $13 million Series A extension round. Per CEO Diego Olcese, the round will lead to “aggressively scaling” an offering that now accounts for half of Crehana’s revenue: Crehana for Business.</p>

<p>Crehana for Business is an enterprise solution packaged for a specific company looking to up-skill a portion of their staff. Crehana will continue to offer individual seats on its learning platform, but Crehana for Business illustrates what Olcese sees as the future: the centralization of education as a focus within companies.</p>
<p>“We’re building this so companies can understand the end-to-end process of employee development in the company, from the onboarding process to when an employee gets promoted in their job,” he said. “We are centralizing that management for HR teams.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185919" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185919" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2185919" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg" alt="" width="566" height="849" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diego1-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185919" class="wp-caption-text">Diego Olcese, founder of Crehana. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Crehana</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a big bet, one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/udemys-new-president-discusses-the-reskilling-companys-future/">Udemy has been working on for years. </a>The San Francisco-based platform launched an enterprise product that now has over 7,000 customers, hitting near $200 million in annual recurring revenue. Crehana didn’t disclose specifics around revenue, but did say that it had 10x year over year growth in Crehana for Business, with the overall business hitting 4x year over year growth; both metrics are between 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Olcese said that Crehana’s biggest difference from Udemy is in how it handles content. Crehana produces, designs and publishes all content on its site, and selects which teachers will instruct on which topics. Comparatively, Udemy has a <a href="https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003469994-Teaching-on-Udemy-FAQ">more open marketplace</a> that allows anyone to start teaching after their identity is verified.</p>
<p>Crehana’s hands-on content strategy makes sense, but is hard to scale; and content isn’t competitive forever. This tension is why the company thinks its future looks more like Crehana for Business, which uses content as part of a broader infrastructure on how employees are skilled, instead of looking like a content provider.</p>
<p>As it works toward becoming an education infrastructure layer, Crehana is experimenting with technology that would allow companies to create their own content that isn’t just localized to geography, but is tuned into personalities, management structures and more.</p>
<p>As for if it ever wants to become a company that would help Nubank, a LatAm fintech darling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">valued at $30 billion</a>, create its own mini-university to train and up-skill employees, the founder was clear: “It’ll be better than a university,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>The Venn diagram in between them both </strong></h2>
<p>Generally speaking, Crehana and Coderhouse’s pair of financings show that investors see LatAm’s digital transformation having a fundamental, long-tail impact on edtech adoption within regional companies. The question then becomes, which is the best way to serve a newly hungry group of learners, and what is the easiest answer for employers&#8217; biggest stresses: unqualified candidates.</p>
<p>The two companies differ in strategy. Coderhouse, for example, believes in delivering education en masse and through affordable chunks. By using cohort-based methodology, the startup helps consumers work on specific skills that can help in a variety of different scenarios, from promotions to finding new jobs. Meanwhile, Crehana believes that going in-house with institutions could be the sweet spot needed to make true change. It is focusing on localized content as an initial moat, but long-term it thinks that employers need a simple way to track employees as they learn, retain and engage with new skills. The company may look more like a learning infrastructure than a content provider.</p>
<p>While the strategies look different in sales, both build off of current strides in edtech, not limited to but including the ability to learn online, the understanding that lifelong learning is a key competitive advantage for professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time when people get loans, it’s for big life purchases such as a house or a car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not every big purchase is a necessity. Some are more for fun, and the financing options for those types of buys &#8212; such as motorcycles and ATVs &#8212; are more limited. Today, </span><a href="http://www.octane.co."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane Lending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that embarked seven years ago on remedying that, announced it has raised $52 million in a Series D round of funding that values the company at over $900 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which offers &#8220;instant&#8221; financing for large recreational purchases, boasts impressive financials in a startup world whose inhabitants are mostly unprofitable. For one, Octane is both net income and operating cash flow positive, and expects to originate more than $1 billion in the next 12 months. It has been doubling revenue annually, and CEO and co-founder Jason Guss projects that the company will see “over $100 million in revenue” this year. Its valuation is now “more than double” what it was at the time of its July 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25 million raise, according to Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Investment Company Inc., a member of the Progressive Insurance group, led its latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Valar Ventures, Upper90, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, Third Prime and Parkwood, as well as new investors Gaingels and ALIVE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest round, New York-based Octane has now raised more than $192 million in total equity funding since its 2014 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane launched with the goal of “making lending better in overlooked markets,” according to Guss. Specifically, Octane initially set out to build a lender marketplace to streamline retail financing in the powersports category. Put more simply, it wanted to help people who want to buy things like motorcycles, snowmobiles, jet skis and ATVs get the financing they need to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that the buying journey in powersports markets was broken beyond just financing,” Guss told TechCrunch. “We elevated our goal to build an end-to-end buying solution including editorial content, consumer pre-qualification tools, instant full-spectrum financing and digital deal closing.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2185843" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185843" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2185843 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="578" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=768,652 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=680,578 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image001-1.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because lending is involved in about 80% of powersports purchases and about 80% of lending happens in the dealership, Octane focused first on building a lending platform for dealerships and consumers. Then in 2016, it launched Roadrunner Financial, a wholly owned-and-operated lender, so that it could offer full spectrum lending, “expand access to credit and speed up transactions through digitization and automation.” Today, the company is partnered with 3,800 dealers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an anchor in dealerships, Octane then expanded its scope. Last year, it acquired </span><a href="https://www.cycleworld.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cycle World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.utvdriver.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UTV Driver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with five other brands from Bonnier with a goal “to inspire and inform powersports enthusiasts across the nation.” Also last year, it launched Octane Pre-qual, which enables consumers to instantly prequalify for financing on OEM and dealership websites with a soft credit pull. With that offering, Octane aims to help direct consumers to a dealership, close their loan and complete their purchase in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are growing dramatically because we make transactions faster and simpler to close for consumers and dealerships,” Guss said. “We are the only platform to offer end-to-end purchasing benefits in the markets we play in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Octane plans to use its new capital to expand to adjacent “other passion purchase” markets and continue to launch customer engagement tools as well as buying solutions for consumers shopping for powersports vehicles online. It also wants to continue to add dealership, OEM and brand partners, which today include BRP, Suzuki and Triumph Motorcycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We define a passion purchase as a major discretionary purchase that brings people joy,” Guss said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most innovation and investment is focused on large, marquee markets such as small business, auto and homes.” As people spent less toward travel and eating out once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the powersports market got a boost, growing double digits last year, noted Guss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our core customer base was not significantly impacted by COVID economically so consumer demand and loan performance remained strong,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Quigg, chief strategy officer at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive Insurance, believes that technology and consumers’ needs continue to evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane’s point-of-sale loan origination platform provides benefits to consumers and dealerships in a specialty segment of the lending market,” he said. “We like to partner with innovative, forward-thinking companies and believe that our investment in Octane aligns very well with this strategy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octane describes itself as a remote-first workplace that has offices in New York and Dallas. It has grown its team by 50% in the last year, from 213 to 336 employees.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sentilink.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an identity verification technology startup, has raised $70 million in a Series B funding round led by Craft Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felicis Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and NYCA also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $85 million since its 2017 inception. The company declined to reveal at what valuation the money was raised, saying only it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“at a very high multiple” of its 2019 $15 million Series A led by a16z.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftali Harris and Max Blumenfeld founded SentiLink in mid-2017 after their experience working as data scientists at Affirm, where they built out the company&#8217;s risk function. At one point during their tenure at the installment loan provider, they came across a “peculiar” fraud case, where 12 identities applied for loans using the same name and date of birth but 12 different Social Security numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair was surprised to discover that all 12 of the identities had real credit reports with 750+ credit scores despite not being real people. It was then they realized how big a problem identity verification was and how poorly it was done, and founded SentiLink with Affirm CEO and founder Max Levchin&#8217;s blessing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based SentiLink aims to help banks, lenders and financial institutions detect fraud at the point of application through a real-time API. Specifically, those APIs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detect fake and stolen identities for new account</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, before a bank issues a new credit card, it will send the application information to SentiLink. SentiLink&#8217;s models and technology assess the credit card application for various fraud risks, including identity theft and synthetic fraud. If SentiLink detects the application as high risk, the bank will ask for more information or reject the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink works with more than 100 financial institutions, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">three of the top 10 banks in the U.S. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has verified several hundred million applications to date, and saw its revenue grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by “5x” over the last year, according to Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Craft Ventures co-founder and general partner David Sacks said SentiLink’s growth trajectory is “one of the fastest” he’s ever seen.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their traction with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">companies from new startups to major U.S. banks is impressive,” he added. “All of this stems from the team’s deep understanding of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fraud and identity. I learned about fraud attacks I didn&#8217;t even think were possible from talking</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with Naftali and Max.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris said the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a few </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">months away from profitability before its Series B but decided the opportunity was “too big to grow slowly.” So it opted to put off profitability so it could expand more “aggressively.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the slew of companies in the space out there, it can be hard to differentiate what makes one unique compared to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Harris, the biggest differentiation in SentiLink’s approach is how much it emphasizes “deep understanding of fraud and identity in our models.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a team of fraud investigators that manually review applications every day looking for fraud, and we use their insights and discoveries in our fraud models and technology,” he told TechCrunch. “This deep understanding is so important to us that every Friday the entire company spends an hour reviewing fraud cases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink, Harris added, focuses on &#8220;deeply&#8221; understanding fraud and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">identity, and then using technology to productionalize these insights.  Those discoveries include</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the deterioration of phone/name match data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">uncovering &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">same name&#8221; fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This deep understanding is so important that SentiLink employs</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a team of risk analysts whose full time job is to investigate new kinds of fraud and discover</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">what the fraudsters are doing,” the company says.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SentiLink, like so many other startups, saw an increase in business during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The various government assistance programs were rife with fraud. This had a cascading effect throughout financial services, where fraudsters that had successfully stolen government money attempted to launder it into the financial system,” Harris said. “As a result we&#8217;ve been very busy, particularly with checking and savings accounts that until now have had relatively little fraud.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to build out its product suite and do some hiring. Today it has 25 employees, with five accepted offers, and expects to end the year with a headcount of 45-50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identity verification has so many aspects to it and approaches, and so we plan to significantly expand our product suite beyond the scoring API that we&#8217;ve started with,” Harris told TechCrunch. “Part of this will include continuing to invest heavily in our product team, part of this will involve partnering with other companies, and it may also include acquisitions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of September, for example, the company plans to launch a KYC (“Know Your Customer”) solution.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Marg, a principal at Craft, said Harris and Blumenfeld’s ex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perience at Affirm “was a clear sign they were experts on this subject.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We love it when founders have an earned secret or insight around a massive problem that outsiders don’t understand, and SentiLink is a perfect example of this,” he said. “Their fast growth only validated that the problem they were solving for customers was urgent and painful.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, chartering vessels and processing ocean freight can be challenging. The sector is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inefficient and fragmented. Merchants also struggle to access finance to perform cross-border trade in the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of digital freight companies are tackling this problem, like Nigerian-based <a href="https://mvx.trade/">MVX</a>. The company today is announcing its $1.3 million seed round to bolster its efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tlmembereo">Tonye Membere-Otaji</a> thought about the idea for MVX in 2016. Having worked in the maritime industry (running his family business and in a professional capacity building apps and websites for companies), Membere-Otaji </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was intrigued by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how no online marketplace for vessels existed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I decided to figure out how to solve that problem of finding vessels because there were too many intermediaries, which made processes difficult,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a few issues relating to not having the right team to build out the product stalled the company&#8217;s progress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Membere-Otaji finally launched the company with CTO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/oluwatobi-amusan-2b379853">Tobi Amusan</a> after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/05/27/nigerian-maritime-logistics-platform-mvxchange-closes-pre-seed-funding-round/">securing a $100,000 pre-seed investment from Oui Capital</a>, a pan-African VC firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MVXchange at first. Its business model revolved around providing a support vessel booking platform that matched vessel chartering requests made by operators with available Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in March 2020, the company made a sharp pivot and tweaked its model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Membere-Otaji cites uncertainty of oil prices and the pandemic as reasons behind the decision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t see ourselves doing vessel chartering for the long term because the demand for fossil fuels will definitely reduce over the next few decades. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to do something scalable, something that was impactful, and something that we could be proud of in the next 20 years,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What followed was the launch of MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform, helping cargo owners find deals on moving containers across Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This April, the company launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, both offerings are now </span><a href="https://mvx-hq.medium.com/mvx-the-new-face-of-convenient-trade-in-africa-dd353c481f7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mvx-hq.medium.com/mvx-the-new-face-of-convenient-trade-in-africa-dd353c481f7"> into one</a>: MVX.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, MVX wants to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online. The startup has expanded beyond Nigeria and claims that merchants from the West African country,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as Kenya, South Africa, Ghana and Rwanda, can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX charges a commission for the services provided, including trucking, warehousing, shipping, and cargo stuffing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it easy and convenient for businesses. Instead of trying to do everything themselves, which can be chaotic and cause </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">distraction from their core businesses, we handle everything because we have all these service providers in one platform. So as shippers work with us, MVX works with like seven to 10 other service providers,&#8221; said Membere-Otaji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for cross-border logistics services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hit revenues of $32 billion by 2025. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the market to reach its full potential. That has been the case, and investors are noticing too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Ghana&#8217;s Jetstream <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">offers a similar service and raised $3 million</a> two months ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SEND is another example; <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/send">YC backs the startup</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what stands out for MVX, according to Membere-Otaji, is that the company also sees itself as a trade finance company.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PqTrMEAXdB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">Ghana&#8217;s Jetstream lands $3M to build the digital infrastructure for Africa&#8217;s trade corridors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ghana&#8217;s Jetstream lands $3M to build the digital infrastructure for Africa&#8217;s trade corridors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/embed/#?secret=PqTrMEAXdB" data-secret="PqTrMEAXdB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept brings together the best of both worlds of fintech and trade. So the way it works is that with merchants looking to move shipments from Africa to the U.S. or China, some lack adequate capital to pay for freight or supply. With MVX, they can proceed to request credit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX passes it over to its financial partners, who lend to the consumers if they meet the minimum requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next, MVX takes care of the shipment and delivers it abroad. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the transaction </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the merchant pays back, with all partners taking commissions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our job </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to empower trade in Africa, and freight is a means to that. From every step involved in that process, from providing trade and finance to warehousing to payments processing, we want to play in all that space. There aren&#8217;t a lot of companies with that trading finance element doing that like us. And also, we see a huge potential in the offline market. Right now, the reason why we have this problem is that transactions are offline. Our strategy in capturing offline markets is also key.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pan-African freight company has already recorded more than 300 shipments this year but plans to end with 1,500. Per revenue and traction, the CEO claims the company has surpassed its 2020 numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX raised money for its seed round from Africa-focused firms Kepple Africa, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa, and Capital Oak. Some angel investors in the U.S., Japan, Nigeria, and South Africa also participated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year-old startup will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its operations, hire staff and improve its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVX is also talking to investors to raise more money, most likely debt, for its trade financing product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>In a statement, Satoshi Shinada, general partner at Kepple Africa, said, &#8220;The trade sector in Africa is one that we believe is ripe for disruption. MVX is building a game-changing technology and platform to revolutionize how businesses in Africa move shipment and trade around the world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data science platform <a href="https://www.dataiku.com/">Dataiku</a> announced today it has raised a $400 million Series E, bringing its valuation to $4.6 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from returning investors like ICONIQ Growth, CapitalG, FirstMark Capital, Battery Ventures, Snowflake Ventures and Dawn Capital.</p>
<p>New investors included Insight Partners, Eurazeo, Lightrock and Olivier Pomel, the chief executive of Datadog.</p>
<p>Dataiku’s last round of funding was a $100 million Series D in 2020.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Dataiku is used by data scientists, but also designed for business analysts and other people with less technical backgrounds. The platform lets companies design and deploy AI and analytics apps, turn raw data into advanced analytics and design machine learning models. It’s been used for a wide array of use cases, including fraud detection, customer churn prevention and supply chain optimization.</p>
<p>The company now has about 450 enterprise clients, including Unilever, Merck, GE, Ubisoft and NXP.</p>

<p>In June, Dataiku launched a fully managed version of the platform called Dataiku Online, which means the company takes care of setup and infrastructure. Co-founder and CEO Florian Douetteau told TechCrunch at the time Dataiku Online is focused on getting more startups and SMBs onto the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Tiger Global partner John Curtius said, “We’ve seen that executing an AI strategy in which data is part of day-to-day operations can have large-scale impact for organizations across sectors and sizes, and Dataiku is well-positioned to continue to help the enterprise realize this potential value given both the strength of their technology and the team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industry veteran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/">Jitendra Gupta&#8217;s neobank for consumers in India</a> &#8212; Jupiter &#8212; has raised $45 million in a new financing round as the Bangalore and Mumbai-based startup gears up for its platform&#8217;s public launch in about a month.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series B, was co-led by Brazil-based Nubank, Global Founders Capital, Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners India. Mirae Assets Venture also joined the round and existing investors including Addition Ventures, Tanglin VC, 3one4 Capital, Greyhound and Beenext also participated.</p>
<p>The new round values the two-year-old Indian startup, which has raised $70 million to date, at over $300 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://jupiter.money">Jupiter</a> has built a neobank for consumers in India. The startup, which launched its eponymous platform in beta in June, is attempting to bring &#8220;delight&#8221; to the banking experience.</p>
<p>“We believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,” said Gupta &#8212; who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to Naspers’ PayU) and served as managing director of PayU &#8212; in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186055" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186055" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186055" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="668" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=1536,1001 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jupiter-neobank-india-jiten-gupta.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186055" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jupiter</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has developed a number of products including a savings account bundled with features that aim to simplify money management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform, which positions itself as a &#8220;100% digital bank,&#8221; also offers the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a standard developed by a coalition of banks in India that has become the most popular way people in the country transact online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nubank and Jupiter share the mission of making banking the best experience possible for our customers, putting an end to all the bureaucracy and the pain in the current system. The Indian and Brazilian markets have many similarities and through this investment, we aim to support Jupiter in their growth path. We see a lot of potential and are excited about joining them so early on their journey,” said David Vélez, founder and chief executive of Nubank, in a statement. The Brazilian giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">raised $750 million in June this year</a> at a valuation of $30 billion.)</p>
<p>In an interaction Thursday, Gupta said the startup, which employs over 120 people, is currently working to on-board the 100,000 people who have signed up to its waiting list. In about a month, he said, Jupiter will launch to the public.</p>
<p>Scores of startups in India are attempting to improve the banking experience in India today. Whether <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/slice-raises-6m-to-help-young-indians-pay-digitally-and-build-credit-score/">you are a teenager</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/fampay-a-fintech-aimed-at-teens-in-india-raises-38-million/">just out of college</a>, or a working professional, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/jai-kisan-a-fintech-startup-aimed-at-rural-india-raises-30-million/">don’t have a credit score</a>, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan. But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort.</p>
<p>“If you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It’s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>Scores of investors have been in talks with Gupta in recent quarters to invest in the round, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Gupta said earlier that he is not looking to raise a ton of capital for his new venture.</p>
<p>“Neobanks such as Jupiter are exactly what India needs: someone who can deliver simple, extensive and high-quality digital banking in a cost-efficient way,&#8221; said Ashish Dave, chief executive of Mirae Asset Venture Investments&#8217; India business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a customer experience so good that it feels like making privileged banking available to folks who dread branch visits and long waiting times. Banking needs to meet customers where they are, and serve them in the most intuitive manner possible. Jiten and his stellar tech team have built just that, on top of the existing banking stack,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ever considerate of its users, Facebook has determined that its privacy settings needed a bit of a shuffle to keep things clear and easy to find. To that end they&#8217;ve taken the &#8220;privacy settings&#8221; settings and scattered them mischievously among the other categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. Instead of having settings spread across nearly 20 different screens, they’re now accessible from a single place,&#8221; writes Facebook in a blog post announcing the changes.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-data-privacy/">that&#8217;s from 2018</a>, when they <em>centralized</em> privacy settings to make them easier to find. <em>This</em> is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/">the one from today</a> about decentralizing them into a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>&#8220;Settings are now grouped into six broad categories, each containing several related settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies … We’ve unbundled the Privacy Settings category and moved the settings previously contained within it into other categories.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185957" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/salt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185957" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2185957" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/salt.gif" alt="Facebook unbundling its privacy settings (but the image is actually a guy sprinkling salt in the wind)" width="452" height="454" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2185957" class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Facebook unbundling its privacy settings into new categories.</p></div></p>
<p>Under which of those categories do you think privacy settings belong? Facebook &#8220;renamed them to more closely match people’s mental models,&#8221; so it should be obvious. Just use your mental model.</p>
<p>If your answer is &#8220;all of them, conceivably,&#8221; congratulations, you got it! Now if you want to update your privacy settings, all you need to do is visit all of these new categories and subcategories individually. Any one of them might have a crucial toggle inside — it&#8217;s like a treasure hunt!</p>

Which do you prefer?<strong> Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>We joke, but Facebook did also make the &#8220;Privacy Checkup&#8221; item much more prominent in this update. This &#8220;guided review&#8221; may give the company opportunities to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/study-calls-out-dark-patterns-in-facebook-and-google-that-push-users-towards-less-privacy/">employ dark patterns</a> that lure users away from less desirable (for the company) privacy choices, but does certainly go through many of the more important settings and let people change them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We’re confident this new settings page will make it easier for people to visit their settings, find what they came for, and make the changes they want,&#8221; Facebook writes. We&#8217;ll all find out one way or another later today when the redesign rolls out for iOS, Android, mobile web and FB Lite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed his support Wednesday for a ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would keep gig economy workers classified as independent contractors, fulfilling a promise he made nearly a year ago to push for laws that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">preserve its business model</a>.</p>
<p>“In the state of Massachusetts, we think the right answer is our IC+ model, which is independent contractor with benefits,” Khosrowshahi said during the earnings call with investors. “Our drivers love it. Prop 22 has proven to be incredibly popular with California drivers.”</p>
<p>His comments come a day after a coalition of app-based ride-hailing and on-demand delivery companies, which includes Uber, Doordash, Lyft and Instacart, filed a petition for the ballot initiative that would classify app-based ride-hail and delivery workers as independent contractors and provide them with benefits such as healthcare stipends for drivers who work at least 15 hours per week. The coalition claimed that the provision would allow drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour in 2023 before tips. The ballot measure, if it passes legal muster and receives enough signatures, would be included in the November 2022 election.</p>
<p>Proposition 22, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">ballot measure that kept gig workers in the state classified as independent contractors</a>. passed in California in November last year. It also exempts gig companies like Uber from AB-5, the bill that entitles gig workers to self-classify as employees with usual labor protections that don&#8217;t apply to independent contractors, like minimum wage, sick leave, unemployment and workers&#8217; compensation benefits.</p>
<p>Gig companies, which largely have yet to become profitable, spent $205 million in marketing for this ballot measure and made no secret about plans to do the same thing in other states. Which brings us back to Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said during the earnings call that the vast majority of drivers prefer the IC+ model over full-time employment. The Coalition to Protect Workers’ Rights disagreed, arguing that <a href="https://noprop22ma.com/402-2/">the ballot language has loopholes</a> that would create a subminimum wage for app-based workers and that few would qualify for the healthcare support promised. It also noted that the measure would remove anti-discrimination protections, eliminates workers’ compensation rules and allows companies to cheat the state unemployment system of hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uber has been using independence as a red herring for years,&#8221; Shona Clarkson, organizer for Gig Workers Rising, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We know that drivers do not actually have independence while driving for Uber. There is no independence in working 70+ hours a week, not being able to set your own rates, not being able to see where a ride is going and having no real control at work. The benefits promised under Prop 22 were a sham that have not materialized. As a network of over 10,000 gig workers in the state of California, we have not seen Uber drivers able to access any meaningful benefits since the implementation of Prop 22.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khosrowshahi said Californians voted in favor of Prop 22 because they had driver support, and he sees no reason why Massachusetts should be any different.</p>
<p>&#8220;We absolutely prefer a legislative outcome in Massachusetts, but if we can&#8217;t get there we&#8217;ll take it to the vote and based on what happened in California, we&#8217;re quite confident,&#8221; he said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Though 2021 is far from over, it’s already witnessed a record level of venture capital activity in the technology sector. With larger round sizes announced daily, founders may have their pick of term sheets — but they need to think critically and strategically about which firms to add to their cap table.</p>
<p>So far this year, we’ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">$292.4 billion</a> in venture financing across the globe, of which $138.9 billion was raised in the United States. Specific to tech companies, the capital is only accelerating: In Q2, founders raised 157% more capital compared to the same period last year, according to the latest data from CB Insights.</p>
<p>It’s not just that more companies are raising money <del>—</del> they are doing so at a higher valuation. Median seed and Series A stage valuations today stand at $12 million and $42 million, respectively, up 20% to 30% from 2020. This can be partly attributed to growing exits/M&amp;A activity in the technology sector, a record number of IPOs and a general bullishness around technology, as well as low interest rates and liquidity in the market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			Good VCs who are aligned with a startup’s vision create more value than the dollars they bring to the table.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At a time when we are witnessing record VC activity, founders would be well served to go back to the basics and focus on the principles of fundraising when determining who sits on their cap table. Here are a few pointers for founders in that direction:</p>
<h2>1. Value &gt; valuation</h2>
<p>Good VCs who are aligned with a startup’s vision create more value than the dollars they bring to the table. Typically, such value is created across a few distinct functions &#8212; product, sales, domain expertise, business development and recruiting, to name a few &#8212; based on the background of the partners of the fund and the composition of their limited partners (investors in the venture fund).</p>
<p>Further, the right VC can serve as an authentic, objective sounding board for CEOs, which can be an asset to have as a startup navigates uncertainty and the typical challenges that come with scaling a young company. As founders assess multiple term sheets, it’s worth thinking through whether they should optimize for VCs who offer the highest valuation, or for ones who bring the most value to the table.</p>
<h2>2. A two-way street</h2>
<p>Running an efficient fundraising process, in part, entails holding VCs accountable to their own diligence requests. While it is unfortunately common for VCs to request a lot of data upfront, startups should share information after assessing intent and appetite on the investors’ part.</p>
<p>For every additional data request, founders are well within their rights (and should) check with their potential investors on where the process stands and get indicative timelines for moving forward with next steps. Mark Suster <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-you-should-never-have-a-data-room-the-most-counter-intuitive-fund-raising-advice-youll-ever-9380172366ea">said</a> it best: “Data rooms are where fundraising processes go to die.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 4, 2021. It’s been hectic: Robinhood’s stock lost its mind. Facebook made another chunk of the internet mad. And a new unicorn wants to go public? It’s been a great day for tech news.</p>
<p>But before we get on with it, we’re excited to announce that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! This Week in Apps by Sarah Perez launches this Saturday morning, August 7, and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness. Be sure to sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">Robinhood’s stock does insane things:</a> </strong>Robinhood users were involved in the GameStop and AMC trading frenzies earlier this year. So perhaps it was inevitable that Robinhood’s own stock would get caught in a similar updraft. That’s what happened today, with shares of the newly public fintech company soaring far, far above its IPO price. So much for the Robinhood public offering being underwhelming!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/human-interest-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-plans-for-an-ipo/">Human Interest is now a unicorn, wants to go public:</a></strong> With a fresh $100 million round constructed of bricks of cash from both TPG and SoftBank, Human Interest’s SMB 401(k) service is now worth $1 billion. Per our own Mary Ann, it’s “targeting a traditional IPO sometime in 2023, with execs saying the target is to have ‘$200 million+ in run-rate revenue before going public.’” More of this sort of clear planning, please.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/neobanks-moves-toward-profitability-could-be-the-path-to-public-markets/">Neobanks’ improving economics could hint at future IPOs:</a></strong> Checking in on the recent financial performance of a few neobanks, TechCrunch discovers quite a lot to like in the numbers. There are some laggards, but the huge, global venture capital bet on the fintech banking model appears to be set to pay off.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/the-stripe-for-b2b-payments-reserve-trust-raises-30-5m-in-qed-led-round/"><strong>Denver’s Reserve Trust reloads for business payments:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It takes a bit of explaining, but moving money around the world is hard without a partner bank. Reserve Trust wants to help companies move their funds directly, sans banking partners. And it just raised $30.5 million to do so. The issues of accepting and moving money online are huge problem spaces, evidence of which you can see in this section of Daily Crunch most days, it feels.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/"><strong>ispace is going to the moon:</strong></a> Japanese space tech company ispace has raised a fresh $46 million Series C to help it undertake a number of lunar missions in the coming years. Three missions in three years, it turns out. The new capital is to support its second and third launches which should come &#8212; take off? &#8212; in 2023 and 2024.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/fullstory-raises-103m-at-a-1-8b-valuation-to-combat-rage-clicks-on-websites-and-apps/">FullStory raises $103M to make digital UIs suck less:</a> </strong>By tracking where users click in confusion, anger or frustration, FullStory wants to help companies improve their various digital interfaces. If you hate how some apps are built (and who doesn’t), FullStory could be good news. The Atlanta-based company is now worth $1.8 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><strong>More money to buy up e-commerce brands:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The global push to raise capital, buy e-commerce brands and unify them under a single aegis is a huge area of venture capital investment. Today’s round is Suma Brands, which now has $150 million to execute acquisitions. The new capital is mostly debt, it turns out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/dubai-based-buy-now-pay-later-platform-tabby-raises-50m-at-300m-valuation/"><strong>tabby raises $50M Series B for Middle Eastern BNPL work:</strong></a> We have a new buy now, pay later round for you today. This time it’s tabby, which is based in Dubai and has a focus on its local region. Global Founders Capital and STV led the funding round, which also included a host of other venture capital firms like Mubadala Investment Capital and Raed Ventures.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/work-bench-will-continue-supporting-early-stage-enterprise-startups-with-new-100m-fund/"><strong>Work-Bench closes $100M new fund:</strong></a><strong> </strong>New York-based Work-Bench has raised a new fund to invest in enterprise SaaS companies. In a world of megafunds and billion-dollar deals, the firm is staying smaller than it probably could have grown. (It also dropped <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/the-state-of-enterprise-tech-in-nyc-1h-2021-funding-report">some research on the New York tech scene</a> that I’m chewing on.)</li>

<h2>What Square’s acquisition of Afterpay means for startups</h2>
<p>In his first column since returning to TechCrunch, reporter Ryan Lawler considered the potential ripples Square&#8217;s purchase of Afterpay may send across the pond of buy now, pay later startups.</p>
<p>For commentary and perspective, he interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Rosen, founder and general partner, Commerce Ventures</li>
<li>Jake Gibson, founding partner, Better Tomorrow Ventures</li>
<li>TX Zhuo, partner, Fika Ventures</li>
<li>Matthew Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>The investors he spoke to agreed that deferring payments helps drive e-commerce, &#8220;but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups,&#8221; reports Ryan.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the board&#8217;s role in an early-stage startup?</p>
<p>Startup founders frequently ask me about the role of a board of directors. A board can be a crucial asset in an early-stage startup.</p>
<p>Here’s a framework for how it can help drive success at your company: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance, or “SPIFS.”</p>
<h2>What is a board of directors, anyway?</h2>
<p>The board of directors helps with governance of the company. U.S. law requires that any company have one, though does not require how big it should be. By generic definition, the board of directors consists of elected individuals that represent shareholders. It is the governing body that provides company oversight and helps set business policy and strategy.</p>
<p>On a more practical level and in a startup environment, the board can aid in creating a successful business strategy, putting together the right management team, developing branding, building good financial habits, and avoiding legal and compliance issues. The needs and composition of the board will change depending on the startup’s stage, management and financing history (e.g., if there are preferred shareholders, investors that require a board seat and more).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Investors often ask founders about their board: It says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors often ask founders about their board for two reasons. First, it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged. The founder can typically choose who is on their board (through careful selection of investors and advisers) and negotiate a board structure they prefer.</p>
<p>Typically, a healthy board will have a good balance between common shareholders, preferred shareholders and <a href="https://tylerjewell.substack.com/p/independent-board-member-guide">independents</a>. It also helps investors and analysts understand who will ask critical questions and give important advice to the company’s executive management, especially when the going gets tough (it inevitably does!).</p>
<h2>What exactly can a board help you do?</h2>
<p>After 20 years as a venture capitalist and board member, I boiled down the value of a board into five main pieces under the acronym SPIFS: Strategy, People, Image, Finance and Systems for compliance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2185878" style="width: 2718px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2185878" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2185878 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png" alt="SPIFS matrix that describes the role a board of directors plays in an early stage startup" width="2708" height="1524" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png 2708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DTC_GAdkin_Graphic.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2708px) 100vw, 2708px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2185878" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dell Technologies Capital</p></div></p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Setting business strategy is one of the main ways that the board helps founders, especially if it’s their first time running a business. It is a valuable sounding board for validating that you have taken a sober account of the market and have the right plan to develop your product and acquire customers.</p>
<p>The board should ask these questions when guiding founders through setting strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I win?</li>
<li>What problem am I solving?</li>
