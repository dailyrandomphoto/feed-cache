										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things have been more fascinating and frustrating to witness in 2021 than the rise of million-dollar NFT profile pic projects. The collections of 10,000 procedurally-generated JPGs earning market caps of hundreds of millions at the hands of seemingly naked speculation have bewildered skeptics and enriched acolytes.</p>
<p>The promise for most of these projects has that given enough money and community support, a culture and brand can emerge from the ether. Such has been the pitch of Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC), which has become the break-out NFT project of the year as more users have raced to buy the pictures of monkeys and sent floor prices soaring to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Part of that value has been centered on the belief that BAYC can become a cultural touchstone, and the group took a big step towards that goal today announcing that they&#8217;ve partnered with blockchain gaming unicorn Animoca Brands to release a Bored Apes-themed game next year.</p>
<p>The game has an admittedly steep challenge ahead of it, building a mainstream game around a community with a prohibitively expensive barrier to entry. Weighing the exclusivity of the core NFT project with the democratization of assets needed to build up a substantial user base is a balance that has yet to be achieved, or even attempted, at scale.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s press release announcing the title had scant details to share other than that the game will feature so-called &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; mechanics and is targeting a Q2 2022 release date. Yuga Labs, the developer behind BAYC, has previously detailed that they are working on a token tied to the project.</p>
<p>In October, Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands raised $65 million at a $2.2 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security teams around the globe are scrambling to fix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/">Log4Shell</a>, a critical security flaw in Log4j, an open source logging software that&#8217;s found practically everywhere from online games to enterprise software and cloud datacenters. Its ubiquity has put the internet on high alert as attackers ramp up their efforts to target vulnerable systems.</p>
<p>Log4Shell is a zero-day vulnerability — named as such since affected organizations have zero days to patch their systems — that allows attackers to remotely run code on vulnerable servers running Log4j, which developers use to keep a record of what&#8217;s happening inside an application as it runs. The vulnerability is tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228</a> and was given the maximum 10.0 severity rating, meaning attackers can remotely take full control of a vulnerable system over the internet without any interaction from the victim — and it doesn’t require much skill to pull it off.</p>
<p>Initial reports said exploitation of Log4Shell first began last Thursday, with Minecraft outed as Log4Shell&#8217;s first big-name victim. But security researchers at Cisco Talos and Cloudflare say they found evidence that Log4Shell was first exploited two weeks earlier. Talos said it first observed attacker activity related to the flaw on December 2, while Cloudflare said it observed a successful exploit a day earlier on December 1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Earliest evidence we’ve found so far of #Log4j exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC,” Matthew Prince, Cloudflare co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073">tweeted</a>. “That suggests it was in the wild at least 9 days before [it was] publicly disclosed. However, don’t see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure.”</p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s affected?</h2>
<p>Since the news of Log4Shell first broke, the growing number of victims suggests thousands of big-name companies and services are likely affected by the flaw. According to <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface">a GitHub list that’s being regularly updated</a>, Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Google, IBM, Tesla, Twitter, and Steam are among the organizations impacted. Separately, VMware released an <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisory</a> to warn customers that many of its products are affected, and Cisco has <a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd">confirmed</a> that some of its products are impacted by the flaw.</p>
<p>Many of these companies have been quick to act. Cloudflare tells TechCrunch that it has updated systems to prevent attacks and saw no evidence of exploitation, Microsoft said it had issued a software update for Minecraft users, and Valve has confirmed that it &#8220;immediately reviewed&#8221; its services and concluded that there are no risks to Steam associated.</p>
<p>Apple — whose iCloud service was vulnerable — <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/12/12/last-week-on-my-mac-when-the-internet-caught-fire/comment-page-1/">reportedly patched</a> its cloud service, but did not respond to our request for comment. Researchers found that iCloud&#8217;s web interface was vulnerable on December 9 and December 10, but that the exploit no longer worked on December 11.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation, which maintains the Log4j software, released an emergency security patch, as well as mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately. There are also a number of third-party mitigations available; Huntress Labs has created a <a href="https://log4shell.huntress.com/">free Log4Shell scanner</a> that companies can use to assess their own systems, and Cybereason has released a Log4Shell “vaccine&#8221; that is<a href="https://github.com/Cybereason/Logout4Shell"> available on GitHub</a> on free.</p>
<h2>How bad is the flaw?</h2>
<p>As the number of companies and services impacted by Log4Shell grows, as does the number of attacks exploiting the vulnerability. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">blog post</a> over the weekend, Microsoft said it has “observed activities including installing coin miners, Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement, and exfiltrating data from compromised systems.”</p>
<p>Security firm Kryptos Logic also said on Sunday that it detected more than 10,000 different IP addresses probing the internet, which is 100-times the number of systems that were probing for Log4Shell on Friday.</p>
<p>Cado Security has also seen an increase in active exploitation. Speaking to TechCrunch, the company said that on December 11, there were a number of Mirai botnet activities exploiting Log4Shell, as well as Mushtik activity from a number of IP ranges. The company said it believes that, based on the typical chain of events for exploits, “there is a very strong likelihood of targeted ransomware attacks stemming from Log4Shell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the wide-ranging nature of Log4Shell, and the likelihood that ransomware will follow, this is likely the calm before the storm. Patching or mitigating the vulnerability should be at the top of every security team&#8217;s priority list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.unique.ch">Unique</a>, a video calls platform that uses AI to teach sales teams how to improve their pitches, has closed a $6 million Seed round from a bunch of Angel investors. These include Phillip Stauffer, U.S based founder and general partner of Fyrfly Venture Partners, and Daniel Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Unique uses AI to analyse customer conversations. The video recordings of these then help sales people work out what parts of their pitch work best.</p>
<p>It can do this in 12 languages, including tough ones like Swiss German. The upside, says the company, is that this can reduce the time to train salespeople and improve their performance. It will also capture key moments of the sales video call that are securely shared in a “Deal Room” in one place that buyers can refer back to and share with their own teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was founded by by serial entrepreneurs Manuel Grenacher and Andreas Hauri, following their own experiences of building and guiding a sales team at Coresystems, a B2B SaaS startup they previously sold to SAP. <br />
 <br />
Grenacher said: “With remote and hybrid working here to stay, sales teams are often far away from their customers, prospects, and from their own colleagues and team leaders. This makes it difficult for them to connect with customers and to learn from their team, to get feedback and to ramp up. We are building Unique to reinvent the sales process, using AI to analyse conversations to light up key moments of insight and connection to help sales teams and customers build deeper, more productive relationships.”</p>
<p>Philipp Stauffer, investor: “The intersection of the sales force automation and the conversational intelligence markets will see itself catapulted ahead both in terms of buying priority at Fortune500 companies as well as growth rates. The value creation opportunity to enhance sales outcomes is simply massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unique competes with the likes of Gong.io and People.AI, (both unicorns). Where the startup may have an edge, however is with its ‘Deal Room’ approach, plus the fact it’s built in Europe and therefore complies with strict GDPR privacy regulations, plus its and EU localization. It may also eat into Zooms market as well, if sales teams start using it more than the latter.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) <a href="https://www.uokik.gov.pl/news.php?news_id=18092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> that it&#8217;s opened an investigation into changes to how Apple&#8217;s mobile platform operates in relation to the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature that requires app developers to ask iOS users for permission to track them for ad-targeting.</p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant announced ATT back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">summer last year</a> &#8212; launching it, after some delay and ongoing advertiser objections, with iOS 14.5 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice, this means that Apple has significantly reduced the ability of third-party apps to obtain personal data on iOS in order to send personalised ads,&#8221; the UOKiK writes in a press announcement of the probe. &#8220;However, this does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads. At the same time, doubts have arisen as to whether the rules established by Apple were not designed to promote their own advertising service, Apple Search Ads, which could be a violation of competition principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The actions of digital giants are a challenge for antitrust authorities all around the world,&#8221; added Tomasz Chróstny, the president of UOKiK, in a statement<em>. &#8220;</em>During the course of our investigation, we want to examine whether Apple&#8217;s actions may be aimed at eliminating competitors in the market for personalised advertising services, the objective being to better sell their own service. We will investigate whether this is a case of exclusionary abuse of market power.&#8221;</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog already took at look at ATT, following advertiser complaints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">earlier this year</a>, France&#8217;s <em>Autorité de la concurrence </em>declined to block Apple&#8217;s launch of ATT &#8212; saying, back in March, that it did not consider the introduction of the feature to be an abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p>Although the <em>Autorité</em> said it would continue investigating the policy change &#8212; specifically saying it wanted to check whether Apple was applying less restrictive rules for its own apps vs third party developers&#8217; ads (which appears to be a key part of the concern driving UOKiK&#8217;s probe).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/embed/#?secret=gznIL5MQxK" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cupertino has been accused of hypocrisy by advertisers who pointed to earlier defaults on iOS opting users into Apple&#8217;s own tracking-based ads vs the new requirement that third parties must ask for permission.</p>
<p>Back in October, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/074b881f-a931-4986-888e-2ac53e286b9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> also reported that the switch had created what it described as &#8220;a windfall&#8221; for Apple, suggesting the company&#8217;s advertising business has more than tripled its market share in the six months after it introduced the changes that obstructed rivals from targeting ads at users. (Although it&#8217;s worth noting that Apple&#8217;s Search Ads comprise only a tiny fraction of the entire mobile ad market so 3x of a tiny amount is still very small beer.)</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: In iOS 15, Apple quietly changed its earlier default that had opted iOS users into receiving its own personalized ads, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9to5Mac</a> reported in September &#8212; when it started prompting users for their consent to its ad targeting, bringing it more in line with its policy mandate that third parties must request user permission to track.</p>
<p>Although &#8212; again important to note &#8212; iOS users have always been able to switch off tracking for Apple&#8217;s ads via their device settings, unlike some third party apps (like Facebook) that offer users no choice over ad tracking at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting element of the Polish investigation is &#8212; therefore &#8212; not the question of whether Apple is playing fair but its observation that ATT &#8220;does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads&#8221;. Although the probe sounds more narrowly focused on whether or not Apple is self-preferencing. (We&#8217;ve reached out to the UOKiK with questions about its investigation and will update this report if the regulator responds.)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.lockdownprivacy.com/2021/09/22/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> of ATT&#8217;s &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; at stopping third party tracking, carried out by an ad blocker called Lockdown Privacy and published this fall, questioned whether the feature creates merely &#8220;an illusion of privacy&#8221;, given the researchers found no difference in the total number of active third-party trackers; and what they described as &#8220;a minimal impact&#8221; on the total number of third-party tracking connection attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We further confirmed that detailed personal or device data was being sent to trackers in almost all cases,&#8221; the study also concluded.</p>
<p>Whether increased transparency should lead to a reduction of tracking scripts &#8212; and therefore whether that&#8217;s a good way to measure ATT&#8217;s &#8220;efficiency&#8221; &#8212; is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>Another is how the market may be shifting in response to platform flexes like ATT &#8212; or, well, <em>pretending</em> to shift.</p>
<p>Last week, another report in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> suggested Apple might have reached what the newspaper described as a &#8220;quiet truce&#8221; with advertisers &#8212; claiming it was loosely interpreting the ATT policy to continue to allow third parties to collect reams of personal data, so long as the data they gobbled up is &#8220;anonymised and aggregated rather than tied to specific user profiles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thing is, the adtech industry has a long history of making bogus claims of anonymization. While an unholy host of faceless adtech entities have spawned and proliferated in the space by trading and &#8216;syncing&#8217; user data with each other &#8212; to undermine people&#8217;s privacy and erode their ability to protect themselves from tracking exactly by re-identifying individuals (via their devices, ad IDs, cookie data etc etc) so they can continue the lucrative business of building profiles to target individuals with ads.</p>
<p>So whether suggestions by a handful of major advertisers cited in the FT article &#8212; including Snap and Facebook &#8212; that they&#8217;re shifting their ad targeting efforts to &#8216;cohort&#8217;-based advertising would survive careful scrutiny of what actually gets done with any in-flows of &#8220;aggregated&#8221; iOS user data remains to be seen. (And may indeed require regulatory oversight &#8212; such as through legislative proposals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Europe&#8217;s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act</a> &#8212; actually doing the due diligence.)</p>
<p>Ad giant Google has also &#8212; in recent years &#8212; been pressing for the industry to switch to cohort-based targeting &#8212; which it claims is better for privacy, even as its suggested &#8220;federated learning of cohorts&#8221; (aka FloCs) tech would do nothing to prevent vulnerable groups being selected for targeted manipulation. (Indeed, some critics of Google&#8217;s proposal suggest it will actually make predatory targeting worse.)</p>
<p>In the UK, Google&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan has attracted close regulatory interest.</p>
<p>It is currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">overseen by the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog</a> &#8212; which has said it wants to ensure that the market-shifting changes are implemented in a way that&#8217;s both fair to advertisers and Google competitors <em>and also</em> not terrible for user privacy (although oversight of the latter piece is handed off to the UK&#8217;s ICO, which has a reputation for roundly failing to enforce against any of the adtech industry&#8217;s myriad privacy breaches, so&#8230; ).</p>
<p>All of this is to say that the (power) balancing act is real. But also that regional regulation is far more muscular on the antitrust side than it has <em>ever been</em> in standing up for privacy and data protection &#8212; which risks an unbalanced outcome where adtech vs privacy is concerned. So the stakes for users remain eye-wateringly high.</p>
<p>The European Union, meanwhile, has been a bit of a bystander on this front.</p>
<p>It has its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">active antitrust case ongoing against Apple</a> &#8212; related to rules it applies to its App Store. However the Commission&#8217;s complaint is narrowly focused on the music streaming market, so only on concerns that Apple is potentially distorting competition in that specific segment.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">has its eye on Apple Pay</a> too &#8212; but, so far, the Commission hasn&#8217;t taken action in relation to ATT &#8212; which leaves national competition regulators across the bloc, such as Poland&#8217;s UOKiK and France&#8217;s <em>Autorité de la concurrence</em> free to pursue probes if they believe concern is merited.</p>
<p>The Commission did finally open a formal probe of Google&#8217;s adtech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">this summer</a> &#8212; which includes scrutiny of its Sandbox proposal. But it&#8217;s fair to say the EU&#8217;s executive has lagged behind on adtech scrutiny and interventions. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">As have gatekeeping national data protection regulators</a>.)</p>
<p>So a lack of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">joined up thinking</a> at a national level &#8212; between Europe&#8217;s competition enforcers and privacy regulators &#8212; could risk putting chilling limits on even the (limited) pro-privacy changes that a powerful platform-operating company like Apple can bring in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Our Notus algorithm identified you as the most impactful journalist for our audience.”</p>
<p>As a slight narcissist &#8212; as all writers are &#8212; I saw this line in a cold email and had two immediate thoughts: first, is the founder just saying this because they want me to write about their funding round, and second, how in the world did my name come up?</p>
<p>So, I hopped on the phone with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuliya Bel</a>, the co-founder of <a href="https://getnotus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notus</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ask any marketing folk and they’ll tell you about the term “earned growth,” otherwise known as the exposure that companies get naturally through other media, whether it be a podcast shout-out or heck, even a mention in this article. With that background, Bel and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stormtv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Storm</a>&#8216;s vision &#8212; to make companies be better at speaking to their target audience through external media &#8212; made a lot of sense. </span></p>
<p>For their fundraising announcement, Bel said that Notus first decided what the goal outcome was: tell the story of the company to data engineers and designers for eventual recruitment purposes. Then, the company began identifying different startups they think have done a good job at building networks and gaining media attention. Finally, it looked for reporters that have the most impact and are most relevant to those audiences.</p>
<p>While Bel wouldn&#8217;t share more on how she defines impact and relevance, I think it prioritizes how certain, public-facing people speak and engage on topics via Twitter (the company’s goal is to be cross-platform eventually). She said that Notus eventually found my name because I co-host <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/equity-podcast/">Equity</a>, a thrice-weekly podcast about tech and startup news.</p>
<p>This process still didn’t feel entirely clear, so I asked for more information about Notus’s algorithm. All Bel shared is that the startup analyzes an audience by looking at the interactions of their audience members, through retweets, mentions, likes, replies and more on Twitter. The algorithm then produces “a list of trending voices” for brands to explore and filter. Within the private beta, Notus has analyzed 182 million Tweets and 129 million interactions for its insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entrepreneur explained how one of Notus’ partners, who is well known in tech and venture capital, is trying to expand awareness of them to different demographics. “They start by picking a company or a person that already has market penetration with the target audiences they want to get in front of, and then use Notus to analyze the audiences and understand the creators and voices that they engage with,” she explained.</p>
<p>It’s not all about reaching out to fintech folks on Twitter with the most followers. The co-founder said the startup also amplifies folks “who may not have the largest audience, but they’re fanatically evangelizing this product&#8230;those are the people that you want to empower to continue to post more things but also give them more ways to create more content,” she said. “For example, giving them an exclusive look as they grow the company public; or having a VIP experience for power users.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s biggest challenge long-term will be around proving outcomes. Bel explained how brands &#8220;can&#8217;t create a cult-like following by buying ads.&#8221; But can they by paying a third-party platform, like Notus, to show them who is worth making a connection with? Some may think that the future needs to be organic, while others could see how more data can lead to compounded influence.</p>
<p>As you figure out where you stand, Notus has already convinced a slew of investors to pour money into the ambitious vision. The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla.</p>
<p>Ohanian spoke in a statement about the importance of software, even with a goal as amorphous as influence.</p>
<p>“As the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented, so Notus is the only way a brand can understand, reach and grow their audience,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://studyfree.com/">StudyFree</a> — which connects students with international educational opportunities via a community-driven B2C SaaS model — has raised a $3 million seed investment round led by I2BF Global Ventures, TMT Investments, and TechStars. Also participating was PandaDoc CEO Mikita Mikado and Google&#8217;s ex-director of product Andrey Doronichev. StudyFree has now received a total of $3.6 million in funding. The new funds will be used to attract new members to the community, expand into new markets, marketing, and platform development.</p>
<p>Founded in November 2018, StudyFree helps students and alumni to enroll in universities and graduate schools internationally, by listing scholarships and grants. It claims that international students using its platform have now received scholarships and grants worth $10.3M to study in universities across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It offers more than 300,000 programs for various degrees with scholarships, with a user base of 90,000 students.</p>
<p>Dasha Kroshkina, CEO and founder of StudyFree said: “As someone who was born in a small town, but managed to study internationally, I know more than most how important it is for everyone in the world to have this opportunity. We estimate the international overseas education market is 15 million students per year.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>StudyFree&#8217;s main competitors is <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a> (a unicorn) and traditional consulting agencies, but unlike the latter, StudyFree leverages its independent community of students with study abroad experience who act as mentors and assist new users with enrollment. These alumni, who have a strong desire to &#8216;give back&#8217;, can host community events and network with these new students. The service then generates revenue through a subscription model.</p>
<p>Mikita Mikado, CEO of PandaDoc said: “StudyFree has become a leading expert in international university admissions with a proven 98% success rate for its students over the last 3 years. It’s changed the adviser market, not only by digitizing the advising process throughout the application process, but also by making human capital and community the foundation of its product.”</p>
<p>Kroshkina is the first female founder to win the Seedstars global competition in its 7-year history. StudyFree was also selected by TechStars New York City Accelerator and Berkeley SKYDECK, in addition to attracting investment from TechStars twice. Previous investors included Acrobator VC, the fund launched by Bas Godska and Joachim Laqueur to invest in Western and Eastern Europe, and Chris Adelsbach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While OpenSea has already seemed to win the lion&#8217;s share of NFT marketplace traffic, competing storefronts are still striving to find their niche and prepare for a future where NFTs mean more than tradable JPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fractal.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractal</a>, a new NFT marketplace co-founded by serial entrepreneur Justin Kan, is looking to capture that opportunity on a rising network, the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The platform is being built around opportunities in gaming and so-called play-to-earn titles, allowing users to shop for avatars and digital goods. The platform has been focusing on bulking up support for existing crypto games ahead of launch, but Kan and the Fractal team are hoping to turn the platform into a sort of Kickstarter for blockchain games, allowing users to buy exclusive NFTs in pre-sales that help fund the creation of the games themselves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kan and the rest of the team hope to launch the Fractal platform publicly in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Like many other networks in the crypto space, it&#8217;s been a good year for Solana, though the blockchain&#8217;s backers have had a better year than most as they&#8217;ve watched the value of the currency tied to the network balloon from kess than $2 to over $250 this year (though the currency has seen a substantial correction in recent months). The network is a bet on a future where the Ethereum network&#8217;s modularity and slow-moving central foundation fail to keep up with the needs of the web3 user base. Proponents see the low-fee high-bandwidth structure as an ideal place to build NFT projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that Solana is the future of gaming,&#8221; Kan tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Kan previously co-founded Twitch, which famously exited to Amazon. Since shuttering his last startup, Atrium, Kan has been focusing on his entrepreneurship-focused YouTube channel and podcast as well as the incubator/investment fund<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/with-goat-capital-justin-kan-and-robin-chan-want-to-keep-founding-alongside-the-right-teams/"> Goat Capital</a>, which he&#8217;s been building with partner Robin Chan. Fractal is a product of this incubator and an effort Kan is hoping to put some of his founder star power behind by joining as co-founder and president. Chan will also be taking the role of head of Business Development alongside Fractal&#8217;s other co-founders, CTO Mike Angell and CPO David Wurtz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fractal is, in part, a bet on the importance curation will play in a blockchain future where fees and listing friction are eliminated by more consumer-friendly blockchains and scaling solutions. To date, Ethereum&#8217;s expensive listing costs have been one of the few things stopping spammers from flooding existing marketplaces with thousands of low-effort NFTs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $19.7 billion acquisition of speech-to-text specialist Nuance by Microsoft, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">earlier this year</a>, has attracted the attention of the U.K.&#8217;s active antitrust watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-corporation-slash-nuance-communications-inc-merger-inquiry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> it&#8217;s taking a first look to assess whether there are reasons to be concerned about the proposed deal.</p>
<p>A decision on whether the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will open a phase 1 investigation will follow in due course.</p>
<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no stated time frame for the regulator to take a decision on that &#8212; but a consultation period in which the CMA is inviting interested parties to comment runs until January 10, 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antitrust oversight of proposed acquisitions can stretch to many months &#8212; and can, at the least, lead to major delays to clearing transactions.</p>

<p>In a statement on the development, the CMA said it is &#8220;considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time Microsoft announced the Nuance acquisition, back in April, the software giant said it was buying the speech-to-text firm in order to strengthen its presence in the healthcare vertical &#8212; where Nuance has developed a number of clinician-support products (such as tech for documenting telehealth visits; a speech recognition tool for clinical documentation; and AI-powered radiology reporting, among other software tools).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s antitrust regulator may decide the planned acquisition merits further scrutiny &#8212; at which point it would open a phase 1 investigation. If after that it decides there is still reason to be concerned it may open a deeper, phase 2 probe.</p>
<p>It may also decide during one of the stages of its process that there are no competition issues of concern and clear the acquisition.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the flip side, if it has concerns it could decide remedies are required before it can go ahead or even order the transition blocked.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been contacted for comment on the CMA&#8217;s preliminary probe of its planned purchase of Nuance.</p>
<p>Healthcare has been a vertical of growing interest to tech giants for a number of years &#8212; with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/amazon-will-expand-its-amazon-care-on-demand-healthcare-offering-u-s-wide-this-summer/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-takes-wraps-off-40m-ai-for-health-initiative/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/facebook-unveils-its-first-foray-into-personal-digital-healthcare-tools/">even Facebook</a> all taking an interest in building tools for tracking, monitoring or otherwise supporting health &#8212; raising concerns that their ambitions in such a sensitive area will further entrench their dominance and market power as a vital sector steps up digitization.</p>
<p>The U.K., meanwhile, is in the process of retooling domestic competition law to take account of platform power &#8212; and has said it will be bringing in a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition&#8221; regime which it wants to protect smaller innovators from the market muscle of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of legislation to empower a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a>, which sits inside the CMA, to oversee big tech the competition watchdog continues to scrutinize M&amp;A activity and other major moves (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">Google&#8217;s strategic &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan</a>).</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">recently, the regulator ordered Meta (aka Facebook) to undo a completed acquisition</a> of animated GIF platform Giphy &#8212; a notable development in competition oversight given how few big tech M&amp;As have been challenged, historically &#8212; underscoring how the CMA is at the forefront of challenging platform power and ambition (even when &#8212; in that instance &#8212; the order requires a messy transaction reversal).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">the SenseTime IPO is on hold</a> leaves the stock market with just one major tech listing on the horizon: Samsara&#8217;s public debut, which is <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo-calendar/">currently anticipated</a> to price Tuesday and trade Wednesday. That makes it the perfect moment to sit back and chat through a few of the year&#8217;s biggest offerings and how they performed post-debut.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Two things are on my mind. First, what happened to some of the most famous IPO pops from the last year? With rising retail trading around the world thanks to companies like Robinhood and WeBull, some recent tech offerings have had simply massive early trading sessions. Did those initial gains persist? Or did they evaporate, leaving the IPO mispricing conversation somewhat overblown?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, second, what happened to the handful of SPACs that we felt made some reasonable sense before their combination was completed? How is Latch doing? And SoFi?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us.</p>
<h2>So, what about those insane IPO pops?</h2>
<p>If you turn the clock back to one year ago, DoorDash and C3.ai had just gone public, and both racked up simply excellent early returns. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">TechCrunch noted on December 9</a>, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="speakable-summary">Haters gonna hate, IPOs gonna pop. That’s the story today as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">richly valued DoorDash and C3.ai</a>, two American technology unicorns, saw their values skyrocket after they began trading today.</p>
<p>DoorDash shares are up just under 83% to $186.51. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">priced its IPO at $102 per share</a> last night, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raised IPO range of $90 to $95 per share</a>. &#8230; [S]hares of C3.ai are up an even sharper 151% to $105.58, after pricing at $42 per share earlier today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>discourse</em> at the time was that those IPOs were bad in that they were priced incorrectly. That, essentially, bankers had sold their IPO share too cheaply, effectively rewarding their own client base while undercutting the fundraising results of both DoorDash and C3. Well, how have things gone since?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe today launched <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Cloud Express</a>, a new mobile and web app that brings some of the best features of the company&#8217;s sprawling Creative Cloud Suite and Acrobat PDF tools into a single application to help users quickly create anything from social media posts to promotional posters and videos.</p>
<p>Using a template-first approach with built-in access to stock images and other assets, Creative Cloud Express is meant to be far more accessible than the individual Creative Cloud apps. The app will come in both a free version and a paid $9.99/month edition with additional capabilities and a library of more complex templates. Access to the new application will also be included in Adobe&#8217;s Creative Cloud All Apps and flagship single-app <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246376" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246376" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Besides the web app, a free app is now available in Apple&#8217;s app store, Google Play and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>The general idea behind Creative Cloud Express is to give non-professionals the tools they need to bring their vision to life. As Adobe&#8217;s Ashley Still noted, the company has seen a lot of growth from non-professional users in recent years. But while a lot of these users may initially think they want the precision and control of a full Creative Cloud app, the reality is that what they often really want is a fast and easy way to accomplish the same tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing with Creative Cloud Express is we&#8217;re taking all the learnings from our breadth of web and mobile apps, as well as our core Creative Cloud technology &#8212; whether it&#8217;s Photoshop and imaging or video &#8212; and we&#8217;re bringing it into a unified offering called Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; Still said. &#8220;This is really for people who are focused on outcome and not process. They don&#8217;t want to start with a blank page, they want to start with an image from the 175 million-strong Adobe Stock library. They don&#8217;t want to create a font, they want to get access to one of our 20,000 amazing fonts from the Adobe Font library. They don&#8217;t want to go to multiple applications to create a flyer and then create a PDF so they can print it. They want to be able to do it all in one place.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246377" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246377" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246377" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In practice, this means you get access to a vast library of templates to get started, but also tools to quickly remove the background from an image or apply Photoshop-style filters and effects to these images. Thanks to an integration with Creative Cloud Libraries, users will also be able to take assets from Photoshop and Illustrator that maybe a colleague created for them and then re-use them in the Creative Cloud Express app.</p>
<p>There are also tools to convert videos to GIFs, convert documents to PDFs and more. One interesting aspect here is the integration of <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Stock</a>, which doesn&#8217;t feature a free plan but which is integrated (with some limitations) into the free version of Creative Cloud Express. Free users will get access to about 1 million images and other assets. Premium plan users will get access to 175 million Adobe Stock photos, 20,000 fonts and access to Photoshop Express and Premiere Rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less is more in Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; Still said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be able to do everything in Photoshop. Like you don&#8217;t need neural filters, but you do need to be able to do a few simple things like remove a background or make simple edits to an image. With Acrobat, you don&#8217;t need to password-protect a PDF, you need to be able to create a PDF, edit a PDF. A lot of the simplicity comes with our own editing of what are the few most important things that that people need to achieve. What are their intentions?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246379" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246379" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246379" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>In some ways, Creative Cloud Express feels a bit like Spark, its tools for building social graphics, short videos and web sites, on steroids. Adobe wouldn&#8217;t say so, but if you think of this as Spark on steroids, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re very far off, as Creative Cloud Express shares a lot of the user interface design and overall philosophy. Indeed, if you went to <a href="http://adobe.com/express" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adobe.com/express</a> before the launch, it would redirect you to the Spark homepage.</p>
<p>But as Still noted, the company isn&#8217;t seeing this as a replacement for applications like Spark, Photoshop Express or Premiere Rush, all of which are also meant to take some of Adobe&#8217;s core features and AI tools and make them more accessible.</p>
<p>The target audience is also a bit wider for Creative Cloud Express. Adobe wants it to become the go-to content creation tool for anybody from students to small business owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has a story to tell and it’s our mission to empower everyone to express their ideas,&#8221; said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud, Adobe. &#8220;In this unique time, where millions of people are building a personal and professional brand, we’re excited to launch Creative Cloud Express as a simple, template-based tool that unifies the creation, collaboration and sharing process so anyone can create with ease.&#8221;</p>

It&#8217;s worth noting that the new feature is similar to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok&#8217;s video replies</a>, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of the feature, it&#8217;s no surprise that Instagram has launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone.</p>
<p>The launch of Reels Visual Replies comes as Instagram has been rolling out several new features. Most recently, the company introduced a new end-of-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/">&#8220;Playback&#8221; IG Stories</a> time capsule feature. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for &#8220;several weeks.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram has also rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/">“Rage Shake”</a> feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. The social media giant also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/"> introduced the ability</a> to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this update, you can delete items from an existing carousel.</p>
<p>The company is also testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">“Take a Break,”</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. There&#8217;s also a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">“Add Yours” sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “last mile” in the supply chain has gotten lots of attention during the pandemic. Even e-commerce giants like Amazon have struggled to surmount the challenges of distributing product fast enough to keep up with demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But <a href="https://www.factor.io/">Factor</a>, a startup created in 2018 by manufacturing industry veterans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Shultz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Szewczyk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just raised a seed round to streamline a different part of the supply chain process, which it calls the “first mile.” For Factor’s 250+ customers, mostly manufacturing companies, the “first mile” consists of processes like ordering raw materials, choosing the ideal supplier for each order and paying them on time, Factor CEO Shultz told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people look at the supply chain and they think about the shipping containers stuck in LA or the boats outside the port of Long Beach. The exciting thing for us is the problems that we&#8217;re solving more upstream in the chain can really help companies avoid getting in those types of bottlenecks in the first place,” Shultz said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ventilator shortage at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from inefficiencies in the “first mile” of manufacturing, Shultz said. It took six months for supply to meet demand in that scenario because of “manual and tedious” standard practices across the industry, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What caused it to take six months, even with Elon Musk and Tim Cook personally involved, was that inside of that process, there are 700 components that are coming from 200 first-tier suppliers, and then hundreds more underneath that first tier. If you think about how companies order stuff and pay each of these suppliers when there are literally thousands of different moving parts, that’s what takes six months,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246393" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?w=300" alt="Factor cofounders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk" width="450" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg 4475w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246393" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor co-founders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor’s product helps companies manage transaction infrastructure throughout the “first mile” by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate core supply chain processes. It provides payment tools, data to aid in supplier selection and order tracking and execution features to its customers, who tend to make complex products for industrial use in areas like robotics, medical devices and aerospace and defense, Shultz said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies using Factor bring their own suppliers onto the platform, and Factor helps them measure data about each supplier’s outcomes &#8212; for example, how many times a supplier has delivered goods to them on time. Factor is “less so a marketplace, more so an infrastructure to help you make decisions,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that don’t use Factor typically use manual tools like spreadsheets to manage their “first mile” processes. Others use enterprise resource planning (ERP) software through providers like Oracle and SAP, which is more easily customizable but often prohibitively expensive for mid-size and small companies to use, Shultz continued.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246394" style="width: 3781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246394" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246394 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png" alt="Factor's parts status tracking feature" width="3771" height="2620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png 3771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=1536,1067 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=2048,1423 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3771px) 100vw, 3771px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246394" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor&#8217;s parts status tracking feature<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor hopes to provide a more reasonably priced supplier management service for these sorts of companies, but it also sees its payment features as key differentiators from other ERPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manufacturing industry accounts for over 20% of B2B payments globally, Shultz said, but many of the largest companies in the industry are still transferring vast amounts of money through paper checks. Factor’s platform offers automated payment features built on top of infrastructure from payment processors like Stripe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re layering on top of that infrastructure applications that can essentially coordinate where the payments are going, and also provide additional value. We have all this data about your order history or suppliers, and we can now pull in the financial services on top of that,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has seen customer order volume grow 10x in the past nine months, announced today it had raised $6 million in seed funding to grow its platform. Google’s AI-focused fund, Gradient Ventures, led the round alongside Xfund, Afore and South Park Commons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the capital to further develop its financial services capabilities by adding new banking partners and offering financing products, Shultz said. It is currently working with a credit provider to develop a credit functionality for companies to fund their short-term working capital needs, he added, though he declined to name the credit provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shultz, who hired Factor’s first head of sales a few weeks ago, said he was excited to receive backing from Darian Shirazi at Gradient Ventures because of Shirazi’s big-picture view of the company’s growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirazi understood that “buyers are always suppliers, suppliers are our buyers, and we can turn on this viral engine to [become] the base transaction layer for all of manufacturing,” Shultz said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sirius XM</a>, home to the satellite radio business and streaming music app Pandora, is bringing on a new head of product and technology, as the company plans to expand its focus beyond the car to better compete with streaming rivals, like Spotify. The company this morning announced its hiring of former MLB and Disney exec Joseph Inzerillo as its new chief product and technology officer. He will begin his new role on January 10, 2022.</p>
<p>Jim Cady, Sirius XM&#8217;s chief innovation officer, who has been serving as interim head of Product Development, will be retiring after eight years with the company. He will work with Inzerillo through February 2022 during the transition.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the audio entertainment company, Inzerillo was an executive vice president and chief technology officer for Disney&#8217;s streaming arm, where he helped to oversee all aspects of that business, including the streaming, commerce, platform development and globalization plans for Disney+, ESPN+, Star+ and Hulu. Inzerillo first joined Disney in 2017 with its acquisition of BAMTech Media, where he had served as EVP and chief technology officer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://press.hulu.com/?hulupress_executive=joe-inzerillo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previously</a>, Inzerillo had been CTO for Major League Baseball, including its flagship media companies MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network. In this role, he launched MLB.tv, the first over-the-top sports offering, &#8220;instant replay&#8221; and wireless connectivity in all 30 ballparks, and shaped MLB&#8217;s digital business. This ultimately led to the spinoff of its streaming technology platform, BAMTech Media, which he helped found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246547" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246547" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2246547" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?w=411" alt="" width="300" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=104,150 104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=208,300 208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246547" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>While not necessarily a household name, the BAMTech platform has powered big names in streaming, including HBO Now, WWE Network, Eurosport Player, Fox Sports and the NHL.</p>
<p>At Sirius XM, the exec will be tasked with helping oversee the company&#8217;s Information Technology and Broadcast Infrasture and the team that builds and operates those platforms. In total, he will lead a team of 1,500+ engineers and product professionals across Sirius XM, Pandora and Stitcher. He will also be in charge of Sirius XM&#8217;s product roadmap, satellite infrastructure and its overall technology vision and innovation, and will report directly to Sirius XM CEO Jennifer Witz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hire is a big win for Sirius XM, which has been struggling to compete with Spotify and others in terms of consumer interest. Though the company delivered on its last earnings, its stock <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/sirius-xm-performed-investors-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has lost 3% of its value</a> over the last five years versus a 120% gain in Spotify during the same time, for example. In its most <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent quarter,</a> Sirius XM reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9% to reach $2.2 billion in its third quarter and a record 616,000 net new self-pay Sirius XM subscribers to its satellite radio business. At the end of Q3, Sirius XM had 34.1 million total subscribers, down from 34.3 million in the same quarter last year, but projected that by Q4, this year will be its biggest yet on subscriber growth since 2018.</p>
<p>Still, much of Sirius XM&#8217;s business is reliant on automaker partnerships and preinstalls, and catered to a workforce that spent a lot of time commuting to and from the office. The pandemic has reshaped how people work &#8212; now often from home &#8212; and autos come equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrations that allow customers to easily use their own preferred streaming apps. Combined, these factors could make satellite radio a harder sell long-term, as its cross-platform experience &#8212; particularly on the mobile app side &#8212; is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s 2018<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/"> $3.5 billion acquisition</a> of Pandora hasn&#8217;t gone that well, either. The streaming app continues to lose traction with consumers, <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping</a> to 52.6 million monthly active users in Q3 down, from 55.1 million in Q2 and 58.6 million a year ago. Meanwhile, Sirius XM has invested in podcasting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">another for Simplecast</a> for analytics and distribution tools. And it has pursued other initiatives to try to connect with consumers, like Pandora&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">new SoundCloud station</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/siriusxm-partners-with-tiktok-on-a-new-music-channel-pandora-playlists-and-more/">TikTok partnership</a>.</p>
<p>Inzerillo&#8217;s hire could shake things up at the company, allowing it to better capitalize on the products and services it offers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a long-time listener and huge fan of SiriusXM, and I could not be more excited to join this team,&#8221; said Inzerillo, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-names-joseph-inzerillo-chief-product--technology-officer-301443050.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>. &#8220;Streaming and over-the-top offerings have revolutionized the entertainment industry – and audio is no exception. This opportunity is the culmination of all of my professional experiences over the last 30 years, and one I simply could not pass up. From the moment I accepted the role, my mind has been racing with ideas for how we can expand digital capabilities across SiriusXM&#8217;s business. Together, our team will develop a product and technology roadmap that will further differentiate SiriusXM and bring creative new entertainment options to consumers at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>CEO Jennifer Witz also praised Inzerillo&#8217;s 30 years of digital media experience and hinted toward forthcoming product changes in a staff memo, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>With Joe’s wide breadth of experience in building and leading innovative digital platforms, I am confident that he will be instrumental in the development and evolution of our growth strategies across our entire suite of products. As a long-time listener, Joe is eager to come on board and work collaboratively with all of the top-notch talent we have at our Company. His excitement about our products and what the future holds is energizing, and I look forward to all that we will accomplish under Joe’s leadership of this expanded Product and Technology organization.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harley-Davidson is taking its electric motorcycle division LiveWire public through a merger with a blank check company sponsored by executives of AEA Investors and Bridges Fund Management.</p>
<p>The agreement with special purpose acquisition company AEA-Bridges Impact Corp (ABIC) will preserve much of Harley-Davidson&#8217;s ownership while giving LiveWire access to the capital that the public markets can provide and fold in Taiwanese motorcycle and sport vehicle manufacturer Kymco as a key partner. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>The deal is funded by $400 million that ABIC is holding in trust, a $100 million investment from Harley-Davidson and $100 million from Kymco.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Harley-Davidson will own about 74% of the newly combined company. The SPAC shareholders will have a 17% ownership, with the remaining 4% being held by SPAC founders and Kymco. The combined company is expected to have an enterprise value of about $1.77 billion and post-money equity value of about $2.31 billion at closing.</p>
<p>Harley&#8217;s hefty ownership gives it considerable power and oversight into LiveWire. Jochen Zeitz, the chairman, President and CEO of Harley-Davidson, will be chairman of the newly formed company. He will serve as acting CEO of LiveWire for up to two years following completion of the transaction. Ryan Morrissey will serve as president of LiveWire.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be used to fund LiveWire&#8217;s go-to-market strategy, invest in new products and improve its global manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The newly formed company LiveWire will include STACYC, the all-electric balance bikes for kids. That manufacturing edge will be provided in part by Kymco, which Harley <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/aeabridgesimpactcorp/files/pages/aeabridgesimpactcorp/db/994/description/LiveWire_Investor_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in its investor presentation</a> will provide &#8220;penetration in key global markets and light motorcycle and scooter segments via low-cost manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon closing of the transaction, LiveWire be the first publicly traded EV motorcycle company in the U.S. and will trade on the NYSE under symbol LVW.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart’s had its ups and downs in the robotics world, looking for any advantage in a bid to stay competitive with Amazon’s online domination. In July, the mega-retailer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/walmart-will-be-bringing-symbotic-robots-to-25-distribution-centers/"> inked a deal with Symbotics</a>, further cementing its commitment to the Massachusetts-based automation firm. The new deal expanded a partnership first piloted in 2017 that’s set to bring robotics to 25 regional Walmart distribution centers.</p>
<p>The rollout, which will take “several years” to complete, joins partnerships with Albertsons and C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Symbotic says its current implementation “touch[es] over 1,400 stores in 16 states and 8 Canadian provinces,” likely a reference to those locations directly impacted by distribution centers. The company&#8217;s autonomous robotic systems augment existing warehouse structures. Not surprisingly, the company is also leaning in heavily in the ways in which it can impact on-going supply chain concerns.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.symbotic.com/news/symbotic-to-become-a-public-company-in-partnership-with-softbank">Symbotic announced plans to go public via SPAC</a>, courtesy of a merger with Softbank Investment Advisers’ SVF Investment Corp. 3. The deal gives the company a pro forma equity value of around $5.5 billion, while raising upwards of $725 million in gross proceeds, including $200 million from Softbank. It also comes on the tail-end of what has been a very fruitful robotic investment year for Softbank.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Now is the time to take Symbotic to the next level,” CEO Rick Cohen said in a release. “SoftBank has tremendous experience investing in leading-edge artificial intelligence and robotics innovators, and our partnership with them will provide us with new insights, relationships and capital that will help us realize our full potential. Together, I’m confident Symbotic will be a powerful, long-term force in modernizing the supply chain to the benefit of all.”</p>
<p>If the deal closes in the first-half of 2022 as expected, Walmart will own 9% of the robotics/A.I. firm. It’s not quite the all-in acquisitions of companies like Kiva Systems that have formed the foundation of Amazon Robotics, but it’s clear now that Walmart has determined commitments to robotic fulfillment centers to be a necessary step toward its future.</p>

<p>It finally happened, ladies and gentleman and our non-binary friends. The Holiday News Slowdown has arrived. Late, I might add, but still here at last. But that did not stop <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> from making you your weekly kickoff show!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246518" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Welcome to the final Equity Monday of the year. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian PM&#8217;s Twitter account <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/indian-prime-minister-modis-twitter-account-was-briefly-compromised/">was hacked</a> and used to promote bitcoin. Not a great look for the crypto world.</li>
<li>The SenseTime IPO is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">on hold</a> after the U.S. government &#8220;added SenseTime Group Limited to the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List,&#8221; per the company. The AI listing&#8217;s delay is not a great look for Chinese tech market liquidity.</li>
<li>Fuse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/indonesian-insurtech-startup-fuse-gets-25m-series-b-extension-to-expand-further-in-southeast-asia/">added $25 million to its Series B</a>, helping bring insurance products to Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>Thirdweb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/gary-vaynerchuk-mark-cuban-web3-thirdweb/">raised $5 million</a> to bring together no-code and web3, which we think is pretty cool.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies for possible M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Harry’s Labs, the in-house incubator started by razor brand <a href="https://www.harrys.com/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry’s Inc.</a>, announced Monday it agreed to acquire <a href="https://lumedeodorant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumē</a>, the direct-to-consumer brand created to help control all-over body odor.</p>
<p>Harry’s created the innovation group in 2018 that has backed or launched several consumer product companies, including cat products startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/backed-by-harrys-labs-cat-person-launches-its-lineup-of-cat-care-products/">Cat Person</a>, body care line Flamingo and hair care line Headquarters.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows Harry’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2021/03/31/exclusive-harrys-raises-a-155-million-series-e--at-17-billion-a-year-after-the-ftc-blocked-its-billion-dollar-sale-to-edgewell/?sh=5cbd3dcb9759" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$155 million Series E round of funding</a> that gave the company a $1.7 billion valuation and over $650 million in total funding raised since it was founded in 2013. Harry&#8217;s itself was at one time in the position of being acquired. In May 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">Edgewell Personal Care announced it intended to buy Harry’s</a>, but in February 2020, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">filed a lawsuit to block the deal</a> from happening, citing how the deal would limit competition and innovation in the razor market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tehmina Haider, Harry’s chief growth officer, told TechCrunch that financial transactions were not disclosed, but that when the company thinks about a business it will acquire, it is looking for demonstrated product fit and consumer love in the market.</p>
<p>“The idea about M&amp;A for Harry’s is we want to be a multi-category CPG company and build a family of CPG brands,” she said. “We want to create more and better things for consumers, and we are looking for brands aligned with that mission, are positioned in a way we can be helpful and are brands serving unmet needs.”</p>
<p>Prior to agreeing to acquire Lumē, Haider said Harry’s had looked at over 100 companies, and “Lumē checks every one of those boxes, which makes it exciting.”</p>
<p>The company was created by Dr. Shannon Klingman, a board-certified OB-GYN, in 2017 to develop a line of aluminum-free deodorants to help patients dealing with below-the-belt body odor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Klingman told TechCrunch that unlike other products claiming to inhibit bacterial growth, Lumē is “the only brand on the market clinically tested to block the ability for bacteria to consume fluids like sweat, semen, urine, and blood that lead to odor.”</p>
<p>Lumē, which was bootstrapped since its founding, is part of the <a href="https://drugstorenews.com/keeping-deodorant-category-fresh-key-driving-sales-profits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.2 billion all-purpose deodorant market</a>, and over the next year, Harry’s Labs will work with Klingman, who is staying on with Lumē, to scale the business and accelerate D2C growth. In addition, the entire Lumē team will stay on.</p>
<p>“As soon as I met them, I could see we were aligned,” Klingman said. “As a self-funded brand, you can reach capacity to front-load inventory, but Harry’s has the track record to help us do that. I love that they were interested in Lumē for all of the good things and saw the value of what I am building.”</p>
<p>Haider expects the acquisition to close by the end of this year.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghuravinutala/">Raghu Ravinutala</a> is CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.yellow.ai/">Yellow.ai</a>, a platform that brings AI and human intelligence together to automate customer experience for large brands and enterprises.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If given a choice between being on hold with customer service and having a query resolved by a few taps of a smartphone keyboard, most of us would pick the second option. It’s easy, quick and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-12-gartner-predicts-80--of-customer-service-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Gartner</a>, 80% of companies will switch from native mobile applications to messaging by 2025.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, many of the chatbots we encounter on a daily basis just don’t cut it. They lag, misunderstand simple questions and above all, don’t meet the standard of intuitive design that consumers expect.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that the chatbot industry hasn’t evolved since its conception. We’ve come a long way from the clunky, barely functional chatbots of the late &#8217;90s and early aughts. However, there’s room for improvement and innovation. The missing pillar? Conversational UX.</p>
<h2>What is conversational UX?</h2>
<p>Conversational UX has largely been ignored in the bot-building process. It’s an entirely new paradigm in this space, but it’s not a new hurdle altogether. Every new advancement in tech is accompanied by a discussion on how humans can interact with the the tech for better results. Technologists aren’t just tasked with making sure the products work, they must also devise ways to make the experience functional.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Conversational UX is an emerging field, but despite the need for more intuitive chatbots, the industry as a whole is not spending the necessary time and effort into perfecting the experience.</p>
<p>Chatbots often function as glorified web forms, without any of the intuition or seamless integrations that consumers expect to see when interacting with “smart” platforms. But the industry has improved dramatically in recent years: Modern chatbot platforms have hundreds of pre-built integrations, which enable companies to connect their existing systems and tools to provide a secure, unified customer experience.</p>
<p>With every new interface, the goal is to make human-machine interactions better and result in a more intuitive experience for the user. Conversational UX presents a greater challenge because of the nuances involved with human language. It requires careful thought, empathy for the user and significant design considerations to carefully craft elegant experiences.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a few ways we can make the experience better for the average end user.</p>
<h2>Omnichannel capabilities</h2>
<p>According to a recent study, the average American household has <a href="https://www.itpro.com/mobile/mobile-phones/359826/smart-devices-more-than-doubled-in-us-homes-amid-covid-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 25 connected devices</a>, including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets and laptops. This means we’re more connected than ever, with endless opportunities for companies to engage with their customers. But often, chatbots are fragmented across different touch points and can&#8217;t carry the historical data of past interactions with customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A not-for-profit set up by a former Uber driver who successfully challenged the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s misclassification of drivers&#8217; employment status in the U.K. has published a timely <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> pressing the case for proper oversight of the algorithms and data used to remotely surveil and control the labor of platform workers.</p>
<p>Timely &#8212; given the European Union has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/">proposed legislation</a> to enhance algorithm transparency on digital labor platforms as a lever to tackle problematic working conditions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out a plan to flip the odds on gig economy exploitation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/eu-gig-economy-proposal/embed/#?secret=kvOfQAJqeE" data-secret="kvOfQAJqeE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the same time, lawmakers in the U.K. &#8212; which now sits outside the bloc &#8212; are consulting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">lowering domestic data protection standards</a>. Including, potentially, stripping out existing rights associated with automated decision-making; and removing the requirement to carry out a data protection impact assessment prior to processing sensitive personal data &#8212; which the not-for-profit warns would amount to &#8220;a hammer-blow for precarious workers who already have long been denied basic employment rights who could now be robbed of the means to hold rogue employers to proper account&#8221;, as the report puts it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/wie-report-managed-by-bots">report</a>, co-authored by researcher Cansu Safak and former Uber driver James Farrer, who founded the <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worker Information Exchange</a> (WIF), is entitled &#8220;Managed by Bots: Data-Driven Exploitation in the Gig Economy&#8221;<em>.</em></p>
<p>It contains a number of case studies which illustrate the obstacles and obfuscation faced by regional gig workers seeking to obtain data access rights to try to assess the fairness of platforms&#8217; data-driven decisions about them and their labor (up to and including termination of their ability to work on the platform).</p>
<p>Examples discussed include &#8220;antifraud&#8221; facial recognition checks that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/uber-faces-legal-action-over-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-id-checks/">appear racially biased</a>; drivers notified of fraud strikes on their accounts without being given clear, immediate information about what is triggering warnings that can also lead to account termination; and numerous instances of drivers not being provided with all their requested data while platforms work hard to frustrate their requests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WIF&#8217;s report goes on to argue that &#8220;woefully inadequate levels of transparency about the extent of algorithmic management and automated decision making&#8221; is enabling exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>Litigation is one (extant) route for regional gig workers to try to obtain their rights &#8212; including employment protections and data rights &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen plenty of both already in Europe.</p>
<p>Most notably Farrer&#8217;s own employment classification litigation against Uber which forced the platform to finally recognize U.K. drivers as workers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>However, Uber&#8217;s self-serving interpretation still avoids paying drivers for the time they spend waiting for the next trip. (Aka: &#8220;Failure to pay for waiting time as working time enables platforms to take advantage of the immediacy of availability to drive up customer response time while driving down worker earnings,&#8221; as the report neatly sumarizes it.)</p>
<p>While &#8212; even in the U.K. &#8212; such workers are not protected against instant dismissal by (unfair) algorithm.</p>
<p>So the report makes the point that worker status is not itself a panacea against opaque algorithmic management &#8212; with the co-authors warning that &#8220;the recent gains in the courts do not fully protect workers against its harms&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber loses gig workers rights challenge in UK Supreme Court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/embed/#?secret=1sT9Ee9t8s" data-secret="1sT9Ee9t8s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WIF is also supporting a number of challenges to gig platforms&#8217; algorithmic control of workers, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">we&#8217;ve</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions/">reported</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">before</a> &#8212; but that&#8217;s also an expensive and time-consuming process for precarious workers who typically lack resources to fight platform giants through the courts.</p>
<p>So its overarching point is that current protections for individuals subject to algorithmic decision-making, such as those contained in Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, do not go far enough &#8212; allowing platforms to concoct convoluted justifications for withholding the workings of algorithms from those subject to opaque management and control by AI.</p>
<p>Here the report calls out platforms&#8217; conflation of fraud management with performance management, as one example.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that such ‘fraud’ indicators are used as variables for work allocation and that the behaviours generating them are allowed to continue on the platform demonstrates that these are not instances of criminal fraud, but mechanisms of control, which assess how well workers are performing against the opaque metrics set by companies,&#8221; the report notes in a section subtitled &#8220;Surveillance Arms Race&#8221; &#8212; which discusses a variety of systems used by ride-hailing platforms Uber, Bolt and Free Now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suggest that any ‘fraud’ terminology used in these contexts also function as part of the misclassification game, designed to conceal the employment relationship,&#8221; it adds, further arguing there has been &#8220;widespread proliferation and a disproportionate use of worker surveillance in the name of fraud prevention&#8221;.</p>
<p>The report makes the case for increased digital rights protections to steer the industry in a better direction &#8212; allowing gig workers to gain &#8220;equality in digitally mediated work&#8221; versus today&#8217;s abuse-enabling power imbalance where platforms pull all the strings, and deploy denial and/or dark patterns to frustrate workers&#8217; attempts to leverage existing (weak) legal protections.</p>
<p>Categories of data that platforms process about workers &#8212; which WIF&#8217;s report notes are typically made explicit in platform <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/uber-guidance-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidance documents</a> and <a href="https://www.workerinfoexchange.org/ola-guidance-document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policies</a> &#8212; are often not shared with drivers when they download their data or make subject access requests under GDPR, underlining the discrepancy between existing levels of data processing by platforms versus transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our experience, when workers seek out this information, gig platforms aim to make the process difficult and burdensome by engaging in a variety of non-compliant behaviour,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Workers seeking comprehensive data have to navigate exceedingly complex and obstructive website architectures and need to circumvent further frustration efforts by support agents, who unnecessarily prolong simple administrative processes or provide automated responses that fail to adequately answer queries.</p>
<p>&#8220;These procedures can be described as ‘dark patterns’ designed to guide workers away from exercising their rights as data subjects. On the occasions where workers are able to obtain their data, it is often either missing considerable segments or presented in inconsistent and non-machine readable formats, making analysis effectively impossible. These acts of obstruction force workers to make repeated requests which companies ultimately use as a reason for discrediting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all of the DSAR [data subject access request] returns we have seen, no employer has given a full and proper account of automated personal data processing,&#8221; the report adds. &#8220;This is particularly important in areas that can determine security of employment such as work allocation, performance management, safety and security, as discussed through this report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, platforms have sought to shield their algorithms from litigation seeking data on the AIs&#8217; logic, inputs and outputs by claiming the &#8220;safety and security&#8221; of their services could be compromised if such information was disclosed to workers.</p>
<p>(And &#8212; in London at least &#8212; platforms such as Uber appear to have been pushed toward even tighter algorithmic surveillance of drivers (and use of flawed facial recognition technology) as a result of a safety-focused intervention by the transport regulator, TfL, which has, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">since 2017</a>, denied Uber a full licence to operate, citing safety concerns&#8230; ).</p>
<p>But the report argues it&#8217;s the opposite that&#8217;s true, writing: &#8220;In our view, safety and security can only be enhanced when platforms transparently set rules and performance standards rather than relying on covert surveillance and summary dismissals, which are some of the key motivators of DSARs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, the report&#8217;s lead author, Safak, added: “The many worker cases we document in this report make it undeniably clear that the harms of algorithmic management are real and affect the most vulnerable. Gig platforms are collecting an unprecedented amount of data from workers through invasive surveillance technologies. Every day, companies make allegations of ‘algorithmic wrongdoing’ which they do not offer any evidence for. They block and frustrate workers’ efforts to obtain their personal data when they try to defend themselves. This is how gig platforms maintain exploitative power.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Farrer said: “As gig economy platforms mature and regulatory pressure builds, we are seeing employers roll out intensive surveillance and opaque automated management decision making systems to exercise ever more hidden forms of control over workers. This report shows how the latest wave of employment misclassification tactics involves employers telling workers they are truly independent in their jobs while at the same time management control is wielded as forcefully as ever but from behind the digital curtain.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">WIF, along with the digital rights campaign group Privacy International and the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union, is seeking to raise public awareness over the issue as regional lawmakers consider their next steps &#8212; launching a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://privacyinternational.org/campaigns/managed-by-bots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public campaign</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://action.privacyinternational.org/campaign/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petition</a> that calls<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for greater algorithmic transparency and accountability from platform employers.</span></p>
<p>As part of the petition the groups say they will be writing to a number of gig platforms &#8212; including Uber, Just Eat, Amazon Flex, Free Now, Bolt, Ola and Deliveroo &#8212; to &#8220;demand answers&#8221; and &#8220;ensure that the unprecedented surveillance that gig-economy workers are facing from their employers ends&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As they near the end of a blockbuster year for NFTs that saw more than $10 billion in transaction volume, today&#8217;s NFT project developers are finding themselves facing a dilemma &#8212; whether to chase today&#8217;s dollars or tomorrow&#8217;s users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dapper Labs</a>, maker of one of the year&#8217;s more mainstream breakout NFT hits NBA Top Shot, has been looking to convince investors that it can court developers to bet on the latter. Today, the startup recently valued at $7.6 billion is showcasing some of the fruits of this pursuit, debuting the product of its partnership with avatars-for-the-stars startup <a href="https://genies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genies</a> &#8212; an ambitious NFT storefront which the startups hope will serve as a hub for web3 digital identity, allowing users to create animated avatars and outfit them with crypto accessories.</p>
<p>The new platform, called The Warehouse, is launching today to a small network of invite-only users before gradually going out to a wider audience in the coming months, both startups tell TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new platform will allow users to outfit 3D cartoon avatars that they create inside the Genies app with masks, shoes, backpacks and other digital accessories minted on Dapper&#8217;s blockchain network called Flow. Genies tells us that the majority of items in the store will be sold for less than $20, though that&#8217;s notably just for primary sales; owners of those goods will decide the market for secondary sales of individual items. The Warehouse notably won&#8217;t have its secondary marketplace enabled at launch, an effort the Genies team hopes will give the community some time to focus on the product rather than resale values.</p>

<p>Genies has notably already experimented with selling digital apparel and accessories inside its native mobile app, though that venture did not include a blockchain or NFT-related element. Genies&#8217; foray into NFT economics is a bet on Dapper&#8217;s particular brand of blockchain, one that may be less decentralized than networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but one which offers a number of baked-in user benefits, including lower fees, higher transaction capacity and a developer platform that&#8217;s friendly to web3 &#8220;luxuries&#8221; like processing credit cards and users forgetting their passwords.</p>
<p>Flow is certainly not the only bet on a more consumer-friendly blockchain with lower fees and friendlier onboarding, though Dapper has raised some $600 million from investors on the promise of its future success. Competing Layer 1 chains like Wax and Solana have seen more action from native NFT projects in recent months as developers aim to tap into the platform&#8217;s strengths and the wallets of coin holders. Venture investors have also minted several new crypto unicorns this year that are aiming to scale the Ethereum blockchain with &#8220;rollup&#8221; products that allow developers to leverage the network&#8217;s security while processing and bundling transactions on a secondary chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>NBA Top Shot&#8217;s meteoric rise earlier this year brought a lot of attention to Dapper, which saw monthly transaction volume go from less than $1 million in December 2020 to nearly $225 million in February 2021. These days, Top Shot&#8217;s network of buyers and transactions sits far below those of its most notable competitor, Axie Infinity, which had over 520,00 unique buyers in November compared to Top Shot&#8217;s 64,000 according to crypto analytics site <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoSlam</a>. While the broader NFT market has exploded in value since Top Shot kickstarted the party, the vast majority of new high-traffic projects have embraced Ethereum, aiming to tap into the hundreds of billions of liquid crypto wealth flowing through that network.</p>

<p>The launch of The Warehouse is a particularly big moment for Dapper, as it looks to court developers and catch fire again while learning from its mistakes with Top Shot, which struggled early on to keep up with a scaling audience and has frustrated some early adopters who have seen the value of their NFTs sink as Dapper has continued issuing more and more NFT Moments.</p>
<p>“The Genies Warehouse is the biggest release on Flow since NBA Top Shot and we’re looking forward to a similar success,” Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Genies is far from a household name today, the startup&#8217;s high-profile partners most definitely are. For years avatar startups have been popping up, hoping to capture a piece of the &#8220;digital identity&#8221; pie, but game makers have been uninterested in adopting third-party systems and celebrities have been too busy dissecting social media influence to bother thinking about virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Genies has been more successful than any startup in recent memory at building out a network of celebrity partnerships for a product that has a decidedly niche vision of the future of the web, albeit one increasingly shared by investors as the startup has more fervently embraced NFTs publicly this year. Last week, Genies announced a partnership with Universal Music Group to host avatars and digital goods from the group&#8217;s roster of recording artists. Genies has already enjoyed partnerships with a who&#8217;s who of entertainers, including figures like Justin Bieber, J Balvin and Cardi B.</p>
<p>In May, Genies scored the endorsement of Mary Meeker&#8217;s venture fund Bond, which bankrolled the startup&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/avatar-startup-genies-scores-65-million-in-funding-round-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/"> $65 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>While NFTs have enjoyed a fair-weather embrace by the tech industry and venture investor class, there seems to be plenty of evidence that consumers are still skeptical of how expensive digital items that look identical to the ones they&#8217;ve bought inside games for years are supposed to revolutionize their online experience.</p>
<p>Last month, chat app Discord found itself at the receiving end of a wide user backlash after CEO Jason Citron tweeted a screenshot of an integration with NFT wallet platform MetaMask. After thousands of replies poured in, many of them critical, Citron followed up with a <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> clarifying that it was merely an &#8220;internal concept&#8221; the the company had &#8220;no current plans to ship&#8221; and that &#8220;Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Dapper and Genies are aiming to cut through some of the NFT industry&#8217;s baggage with The Warehouse&#8217;s debut.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an avatar 10K profile picture project or us bringing culture to NFTs and crypto,&#8221; notes Genies CEO Akash Nigam. &#8220;We see this as the first step in creating a digital identity across the metaverse for consumers and plan to give the wearable creation tools to consumers and talent down the road.&#8221;</p>
