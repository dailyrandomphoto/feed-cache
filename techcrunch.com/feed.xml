										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting to all the services and microservices that a modern cloud native enterprise application requires can be a complicated task. It&#8217;s an area that startup</span> <a href="http://solo.io">S<span style="font-weight: 400;">olo.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trying to disrupt with the new release of its Gloo Mesh Enterprise platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Solo has had focus since its founding on a concept known as a service mesh. A service mesh provides an optimized approach to connect different components together in an automated approach, often inside of a Kubernetes cloud native environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idit Levine, founder and CEO at Solo, explained to TechCrunch that she knew from the outset when she started the company in 2017 that it might take a few years till the market understood the concept of the service mesh and why it is needed. That&#8217;s why her company also built out an API gateway technology that helps developers connect APIs, which can be different data sources or services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until this week, the API and service mesh components of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/">Solo&#8217;s</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloo Mesh Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/"> offering</a> were separate technologies, with different configurations and control planes. That is now changing with the integration of both API and service mesh capabilities into a unified service. The integrated capabilities should make it easier to set up and configure all manner of services in the cloud that are running on Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo&#8217;s service mesh, known as Gloo Mesh, is based on the open source</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/the-open-source-istio-service-mesh-for-microservices-hits-version-1-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/the-open-source-istio-service-mesh-for-microservices-hits-version-1-0/">project</a>, which was created by Google. The API product is called Gloo Edge, which uses the open source</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/envoy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, originally created by ride sharing company Lyft. Levine explained that her team has now used Istio&#8217;s plugin architecture to connect with Envoy in an optimized approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levine noted that many users start off with an API gateway and then extend to using the service mesh. With the new Gloo Mesh Enterprise update, she expects customer adoption to accelerate further as Solo will be able to differentiate against rivals in both the service mesh and API management markets.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the service mesh space is still emerging including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/tetrate-nets-12-1-million-to-bring-microservices-to-the-corporate-masses/">rivals such as</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/tetrate-nets-12-1-million-to-bring-microservices-to-the-corporate-masses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tetrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, API gateways are a more mature technology.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the integration of Gloo Edge for API management into Gloo Mesh Enterprise, Solo isn&#8217;t quite covering all the bases for API technology, yet. Gloo Edge supports REST based APIs, which are by far the most common today, though it doesn&#8217;t support the emerging </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebooks-graphql-gets-its-own-open-source-foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebooks-graphql-gets-its-own-open-source-foundation/"> API standard</a>, which is becoming increasingly popular. Levine told us to &#8216;stay tuned&#8217; for a future GraphQL announcement for Solo and its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo has raised a total of $36.5 million across two rounds, with an</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/solo-io-raises-11m-to-help-enterprises-adopt-cloud-native-technologies/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 and a $23 million Series B announced in October 2020.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the rocket launch sector is quickly becoming crowded, the same can’t be said for companies developing suborbital spaceplanes. This means there’s plenty of room to grow for startups like <a href="https://www.dawnaerospace.com/">Dawn Aerospace</a>, which has now completed five test flights of its Mk-II Aurora spaceplane that is designed to fly up to 60 miles above the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The flights, which took place at the Glentanner Aerodrome in New Zealand’s South Island in July, were to assess the vehicle’s airframe and avionics. While the vehicle only reached altitudes of 3,400 feet, the flights allowed Dawn’s team to capture “extensive data enabling further R&amp;D on the capability of Mk-II,” CEO Stefan Powell said in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194189" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194189" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194189" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg 3516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194189" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.dawnaerospace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawn Aerospace <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Dawn’s approach is to build a vehicle that can take off and land from conventional airports and potentially perform multiple flights to and from space per day. The obvious benefit of this approach is that it’s significantly less capital-intensive than vertical launches. Mk-II is also barely the size of a compact car, less than 16 feet long and weighing only 165 pounds empty, which further lowers costs.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the Mk-II is the second iteration of the vehicle, but Dawn doesn’t plan on stopping there. The company has plans to build a two-stage-to-orbit Mk-III spaceplane that can also be used to conduct scientific research, or even capture atmospheric data for weather observations and climate modeling. While Mk-II has a payload of 3U, or less than 8.8 pounds, Mk-III will be capable of carrying up to 551 pounds to orbit.</p>
<p>The Mk-II will ultimately be fitted with a rocket engine to enable supersonic performance and high-altitude testing.</p>
<p>The company hit a major milestone last December when it received an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Certificate from the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to fly Mk-II from airports. It also received a grant from by the province of Zuid-Holland in the Netherlands, along with <a href="http://radarbasedavionics.com/">Radar Based Avionics</a> and <a href="https://www.metasensing-group.com/">MetaSensing,</a> to test a low-power sense and detect radar system. That demonstration, which is scheduled to take place next year, will happen once Mk-II undergoes some minor modifications, Powell told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Beck’s earliest memory is standing outside with his father in his hometown of Invercargill, New Zealand, looking up at the stars and being told that there could very well be people on planets orbiting those stars looking right back at him.</p>
<p>“For a three or four year old, that was a mind-blowing thing that got etched into my memory and from that point onwards, that was me destined to work in the space industry,” he said at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUZ6aOZLSf0&amp;t=1402s&amp;ab_channel=spacegeneration">Space Generation Fusion Forum</a> (SGFF).</p>
<p>Of course, hindsight is 20/20. But it’s true that Beck’s career has been characterized by an unusually single-minded focus on rocketry. Instead of going to university, Beck got a trade job, working as a tool-making apprentice by day and a dilettante rocket engine maker by night. “I was very, very fortunate through my career that the companies I worked with and worked for, and the government organizations that I’ve worked for, always encouraged — or tolerated, maybe is a better word — me using their facilities and doing things in their facilities at night,” he said.</p>
<p>His tinkering matured with experience and working double time paid off: In 2006, he founded his space launch company <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/">Rocket Lab</a>. Now, 15 years and 21 launches later, the company has gone public through a merger with a blank-check firm that’s added $777 million to its war chest.</p>

<h2>The space SPAC craze</h2>
<p>The merger with Vector Acquisition catapulted Rocket Lab’s valuation to $4.8 billion, putting it second (by value) amongst space launch companies only to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. SPACs have become a popular route to going public amongst space industry companies looking to secure large amounts of capital; rival satellite launch startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Virgin Orbit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a> have each started trading via a SPAC merger, in addition to other companies in the sector, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">Redwire</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">Planet</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic</a> (to name just a few).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Beyond the fanfare and SEC warnings, SPACs are here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/beyond-the-fanfare-and-sec-warnings-spacs-are-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=vQ3z92rGWd" data-secret="vQ3z92rGWd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Beck told TechCrunch that going public has been part of Rocket Lab’s plans for years; the original plan was to use a traditional initial public offering, but the SPAC route in particular enabled certainty around capital and valuation. According to a <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Rocket-Lab-Investor-Presentation.pdf">March investor presentation</a> in advance of the SPAC merger — documents that should always be taken with a large grain of salt — the future is bright: Rocket Lab anticipates revenues of $749 million in 2025 and surpassing $1 billion the following year. The company reported revenues of $48 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2020, and anticipates hitting around $69 million this year.</p>
<p>But he remains skeptical of pre-revenue space startups, or those that failed to raise capital, using SPACs as a financial instrument. “There has been a lot of space SPACs go out, and I think that there is a spectrum of quality there for sure — some that have failed to raise money in the private markets, and [a SPAC merger] is the last-ditch attempt. That is no way to become a public company.”</p>
<p>While the space industry is relatively crowded now, with companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX sending payloads to orbit and myriad newer entrants looking to join them (or, more optimistically, take their leading place), Beck said he anticipates the crowd thinning out.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s going to become blatantly obvious to investors really quickly, who&#8217;s executing, and who&#8217;s aspiring to execute,” he said. “We&#8217;re in a time where there&#8217;s lots of excitement, but at the end of the day, this industry and the public markets are all about execution. The wheat from the chaff will get separated very, very quickly here.”</p>
<h2>From Electron to Neutron</h2>
<p>Rocket Lab’s revenues have largely come from the small payload launch market, in which it’s managed to take a leading position with its Electron rocket. Electron is only 59 feet tall and scarcely four feet in diameter, significantly smaller than other rockets going to space today. The company conducts launches from two sites: Its privately-owned launch range on Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, and a launch pad out of NASA’s Wallops Island facility in Virginia (which has yet to play host to an actual Rocket Lab mission).</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is in the process of transitioning Electron&#8217;s first-stage booster to be reusable. The company has been implementing a new atmospheric reentry and ocean splashdown process that uses a parachute to slow the booster&#8217;s descent, but the ultimate goal is to catch it in the air using a helicopter.</p>
<p>Thus far, Rocket Lab and SpaceX have dominated the market, but that could change soon. Both Astra and Relativity are developing small launch vehicles — the latest iteration of Astra’s rocket is around 40 feet tall, while Relativity’s Terran 1 is in between Electron and Falcon 9 at 115 feet.</p>
<p>For that reason, it makes sense that Rocket Lab is planning on expanding its operations to include medium-lift rocketry, with its much-anticipated (and very mysterious) Neutron launch vehicle. The company has been keeping the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/">details about Neutron</a> close to its chest so far — Beck told SGFF attendees that even publicly released renderings of the rocket have been “a bit of a ruse” (meaning the image below bears little to no resemblance to what the Neutron actually looks like) — but it’s expected to be more than double the height of Electron and be capable of sending around 8,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118894" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118894" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2118894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Electron-Neutron-e1614601323411.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="875" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rocket Lab</p></div></p>
<p>“We do see a lot of people in the industry copying us in many ways,” he explained to TechCrunch. “So, we’d rather get a little bit further down the path and then reveal the work that we&#8217;ve done.”</p>
<p>Rocket Lab estimates that Electron and Neutron will be capable of lifting 98% of all satellites forecasted to launch through 2029, making the need for an additional heavy-lift rocket unnecessary.</p>
<p>In addition to Neutron, the company has also started developing spacecraft. It’s called Photon, and Rocket Lab imagines it as a “satellite platform” that can easily be integrated with the Electron rocket. The company’s already lined up Photon missions to the moon and beyond: first to lunar orbit for NASA, as part of its Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">(CAPSTONE) program</a>.</p>
<p>Two Photons were selected earlier this month for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">11-month mission to Mars</a>, and Beck has publicly discussed long-term plans to send a probe into Venus’ atmosphere via a Photon satellite.</p>
<p>Beyond Photon, Rocket Lab has also locked in a deal with space manufacturing startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Varda Space Industries</a> to build it a spacecraft to launch in 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>Neutron has been designed to be human-rateable right from the start, meaning that it will meet certain safety specifications for carrying astronauts. Beck said he’s certain that “we are going to see the democratization of spaceflight” and he wants Rocket Lab to be well positioned to deliver that service in the future. In terms of whether Rocket Lab would eventually expand into building other spacecraft, like landers or human-rated capsules, Beck demurred.</p>
<p>“Never, ever say never,” he said. “That&#8217;s the one takeaway I&#8217;ve learned in my career as a space CEO.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 25, 2021. If you wanted to know just how fast the technology news cycle is running today, look no further than our lead story. You’ll note that it is a complete reversion of the week’s previously most important news item! What a world! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">OnlyFans backtracks, will allow adult content:</a> </strong>So much for all that. After igniting an online firestorm by announcing that it would end support and sale of most adult content, OnlyFans has changed course. Now it won’t block the material. For more on the topic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-policy-change-is-a-tale-as-old-as-the-internet/">the Equity podcast crew has notes</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker is going public:</a></strong> After a short summer lull, we could be gearing up for yet another IPO cycle. This time the lead-off hitter may be D2C eyewear purveyor Warby Parker. We’ve all heard of the company, so TechCrunch was excited to get into its numbers. Our take? It’s a very neat company, albeit one that has an interesting time defending its final private-market valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/"><strong>Headspace + Ginger:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News broke today that meditation service Headspace and mental-health-focused startup Ginger are merging to create Headspace Health. The combined entity will be worth $3 billion and have 800 employees. Headspace has long been in competition with Calm, another massive player in the meditation market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a number of thematic pairs of startup news, Kanye West. He’s out with a gadget called the “Stem Player,” which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/kanye-wants-to-sell-you-a-200-music-gadget/">per TechCrunch</a>, is “designed to isolate stems — specific elements like vocals, bass, samples and drums” from musical tracks. It’s a somewhat neat idea. The fact that Kanye is doing it should provide it with a bit of a marketing boost.</p>
<p>From the fintech startup world today, we have two stories, both of which make us wonder <em>just how much money can heavily populated fintech verticals absorb before investors get bored?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/mexican-neobroker-flink-raises-57m-from-lightspeed-the-chainsmokers-to-boost-financial-inclusion-in-latam/"><strong>Flink raises $57M more to build the Robinhood of Latin America:</strong></a> Flink raised earlier this year, a $12 million Series A. Now it is back with a pile of new capital. Akin to how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">every VC wants to fund the next Coinbase</a>, trying to score a piece of the next Robinhood is also big business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/shares-is-a-new-stock-trading-app-with-a-focus-on-social-features/"><strong>Shares has raised $10 million to build a European consumer stock trading service</strong></a> with a social twist. Sure, there are already consumer stock trading services targeting the European market, but private-market capital is betting that there’s room for yet another. The world is going to need more active investors if all the startups hoping to serve them are going to survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the logistics realm this afternoon, two stories that may give you hope for a future in which having stuff brought to your house has a lower carbon footprint and, perhaps, a cheaper price point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/wing-approaches-100000-drone-deliveries-two-years-after-logan-australia-launch/"><strong>Alphabet’s drone delivery business scales:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Down Under. Wing, Alphabet’s drone delivery company, has reached the 100,000-delivery mark, it recently announced. The service is currently live in Logan, Australia, where around 300,000 folks live. Alphabet, please bring this to Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li>And<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/"><strong> Coco has raised $36M for super-cute delivery robots: </strong></a>Somewhere in time there was a committee meeting that I missed at which it was decided that all delivery robots had to be cute. I don’t know why. Coco’s delivery robot is, however, adorable. And now very well funded thanks to capital from a Series A led by Sam Altman of Y Combinator fame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staying close to the logistics theme, here’s a pair of stories dealing with the world of digital commerce in Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/"><strong>Membo is building an “app-based marketplace for local food producers to sell directly to consumers.&#8221;</strong></a> It’s based in Estonia and is taking part in the current Y Combinator batch. Expect to hear more from the company next week during the accelerator’s demo day event.</li>
<li>Membo will compete to some degree with a host of European “instant grocery” delivery companies that have raised some $2 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/europes-quick-commerce-startups-are-overhyped-lessons-from-china/">Picus Capital’s Alexander Kremer recently detailed</a>. The investor thinks that startup lessons from China indicate that “instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance” of traditional grocery players.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to round us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cybersecurity-vc-funding-surges-to-a-record-11-5b-in-2021/">cybersecurity venture capital activity has reached new high</a>, and cannabis-focused startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cannabis-e-commerce-startup-jane-technologies-raises-100m-after-stellar-growth/">Jane just put together a $100 million round</a>.</p>
<h2>India’s path to SaaS leadership is clear, but challenges remain</h2>
<p>By 2030, India’s SaaS industry is estimated to comprise 4%-6% of the global market and generate between $50 billion and $70 billion in yearly revenue, according to a SaaSBOOMi/McKinsey report.</p>
<p>“With the right approach, it won’t be long before the Indian SaaS community becomes a large-scale employer of talent, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and a creator of unmatched products,” says Manav Garg, CEO and founder of Eka Software Solutions.</p>
<p>In a guest post, he lays out several key growth drivers, which include “the largest concentration of developers in the world” and the fact that “SaaS is not a winner-take-all market.”</p>
<p>Even so, the region still faces challenges, since “growth requires a growth mindset.”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/canalys-u-s-pc-sales-up-17-yoy-for-quarter-even-as-tablet-sales-stagnate/"><strong>The PC isn’t dead:</strong></a> So much for iPads taking over the world, new data from Canalys indicates. Per the data company, PC sales rose 17% from year-ago totals, while tablet sales went sideways. Perhaps having full-power machines is more popular than ever, as we all have more work to do than, well, ever? Regardless, the PC news is good for a host of big technology firms, including HP and Lenovo.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/hulu-launches-support-for-hdr-on-select-original-content/"><strong>Hulu launching HDR viewing for some content:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Better late than never, U.S. video streaming service Hulu started rolling out HDR content support on August 19, which “should be available to all users with HDR-compatible devices in the coming days,” TechCrunch reports. So far HDR playback only extends to certain, high-profile Hulu content.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/"><strong>South Korea delays proposed &#8220;anti-Google law&#8221;:</strong></a> If passed, TechCrunch’s own Kate Park writes, “South Korea will be the first country to prohibit such global tech giants from imposing billing systems on in-app purchases.” Apple and Google, naturally, oppose the measure.</li>

		Michael Gorman is SVP of Product, Business Development and Marketing at <a href="https://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a>, a data company focused on mapping comprehensive global consumer interest insights.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Marketing automation has usually focused on driving sales, mainly using past purchase or late funnel behavior (e.g., paid search) as a predictor of an imminent purchase. While effective at boosting sales numbers, this widely implemented strategy can result in a disservice to brands and industries that adopt it, as it promotes the perpetual devaluation of goods or services. Narrowing a brand’s focus only to aspects linked to conversions risks stripping the customer experience of key components that lay the groundwork for long-term success.</p>
<p>We live in a world rich with data, and insights are growing more vibrant every day. With this in mind, companies and advertisers can strategically weave together all the data they collect during the customer experience. This enables them to understand every inference available during customer interactions and learn what benefits the customer most at a given time.</p>
<p>But focusing exclusively on data collected from customers, brands risk falling subject to the law of diminishing returns. Even companies with meaningful consumer interactions or rich service offerings struggle to gain impactful contextual insights. Only by harnessing a broader dataset can we understand how people become customers in the first place, what makes them more or less likely to purchase again and how developments in society impact the growth or struggle a brand will experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how we can achieve a more complete picture of current and future customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A critical component in re-imagining customer experience as a relationship is recognizing that brands often don’t focus enough on consumers’ wider needs and concerns.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Leverage AI to unlock new perspectives</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, almost every industry has capitalized on the opportunity data-driven marketing presents, inching closer to the “holy grail” of real-time, direct and personalized engagements. Yet, the evolving toolset encouraged brands to focus on end-of-the-funnel initiatives, jeopardizing what really impacts a business&#8217; longevity: relationships.</p>
<p>While past purchase or late-funnel behavior data does provide value and is useful in identifying habit changes or actual needs, it is relatively surface level and doesn’t offer insight into consumers’ future behavior or what led them to a specific purchase in the first place.</p>
<p>By incorporating AI, brands can successfully engage with their audiences in a more holistic, helpful and genuine way. Technologies to discern not just the content of language (e.g., the keywords) but its meaning as well, open up possibilities to better infer consumer interest and intentions. In turn, brands can tune consumer interactions to generate satisfaction and delight, and ultimately accrue stronger insights for future use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like so many other aspects of the robotics world, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated interest in the automated kitchen. After all, the food and restaurant industry was deemed essential amid global shutdowns, but finding kitchen staff proved a problem for many, especially early on when questions remained around COVID’s transmission.</p>
<p>This week, California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.spyce.com/spyce-sweetgreen-acquisition/">announced plans</a> to go all in on automation with the acquisition of Spyce. Founded in 2015, the Boston-based startup started making waves a few years back as a spinout of MIT mechanical engineering students. First serving up food at the school’s dining hall, the team ultimately opened a pair of automated restaurants in the Boston area. The startup notes, &#8220;our Spyce restaurants will stay open at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweetgreen plans to eventually incorporate Spyce’s technology into its restaurants. It will likely take some time to scale up to the needs of the chain, which currently operates more than 120 locations across the U.S.</p>

<p>“We built Sweetgreen to connect more people to real food and create healthy fast food at scale for the next generation, and Spyce has built state-of-the-art technology that perfectly aligns with that vision,” Sweetgreen CEO and co-founder Jonathan Neman said in a statement. “By joining forces with their best-in-class team, we will be able to elevate our team member experience, provide a more consistent customer experience and bring real food to more communities.”</p>
<p>Like pizza, salads are a clear target for early food automation. They’re both popular and relatively straightforward to automate &#8212; essentially mixing a bunch of ingredients from different chutes into a bowl.</p>
<p>Sweetgreen is quick to note that the plan isn’t to replace employees outright, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[T]eam members will be able to focus more on preparation and hospitality moments, while having the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art technology,” the company writes. “Invest more in training and development to support team members to become Head Coaches. Interested team members will be able to develop technology-facing skills to operate and maintain Spyce technology.”</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q3. Terms were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hims &amp; Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum said Thursday that his company is in the process of distributing 10,000 primary care and mental health visits to displaced Afghan refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Hims &amp; Hers has built out a multi-specialty telehealth platform that connects consumers to licensed healthcare professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://medium.com/hims-hers/hims-hers-to-donate-10-000-primary-care-mental-health-visits-to-relocated-afghan-refugees-9ccae21b0dde"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dudum wrote that Hims &amp; Hers felt a “moral responsibility to act &#8212; and fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: “The eyes and hearts of the world are currently and understandably focused on Afghanistan and the refugees evacuating en masse. These people are looking for the most basic of needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudum said that Hims &amp; Hers plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with select NGOs, nonprofits and other relevant partners, including translators and the providers on its platform, “to make sure refugees are aware of these services and get the urgent support they need.” The visits are immediately available to refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO also said that Hims &amp; Hers will be covering the cost of the medical visits but that they would be “delivered by the generous providers” through its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDudum/status/1430606813255270401?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dudum said the move was inspired by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his company planned to offer free temporary housing to 20,000 Afghan refugees around the world amid the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies’ initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the </span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of earlier this week, countries had </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-evacuation-war-footing-g7-meets-pullout-deadline-2021-08-24/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evacuated around 58,700 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the country’s capital, Kabul, since mid-August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hims &amp; Hers has evolved into a telehealth platform, it also sells sexual wellness and other health products and services to millennials. The company began </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading publicly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January on the NYSE after completing a reverse merger with the blank-check company Oaktree Acquisition Corp.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has removed <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/tackling-misinfo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>1 million</ins></a> videos for dangerous COVID-19 misinformation since February 2020, according to YouTube’s Chief Product Officer Neal Mahon.</p>
<p>Mahon shared the statistic in a blog post outlining how the company approaches misinformation on its platform. “Misinformation has moved from the marginal to the mainstream,” he wrote. “No longer contained to the sealed-off worlds of Holocaust deniers or 9-11 truthers, it now stretches into every facet of society, sometimes tearing through communities with blistering speed.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Youtube executive argued that “bad content” accounts for only a small percentage of YouTube content overall. “Bad content represents only a tiny percentage of the billions of videos on YouTube (about .16-.18% of total views turn out to be content that violates our policies),” Mahon wrote. He added that YouTube removes almost 10 million videos each quarter, “the majority of which don’t even reach 10 views.”</p>
<p>Facebook recently made a similar argument about content on its platform. The social network published a report last week that claimed that the most popular posts are memes and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><ins>non-political</ins></a> content. And, faced with criticism over its handling of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a>, the company has argued that vaccine misinformation isn’t representative of the kind of content most users see.</p>
<p>Both Facebook and YouTube have come under particular scrutiny for their policies around health misinformation during the pandemic. Both platforms have well over a billion users, which means that even a small fraction of content can have a far-reaching impact. And both platforms have so far declined to disclose details about how vaccine and health misinformation spreads or how many users are encountering it. Mahon also said that removing misinformation is only one aspect of the company’s approach. YouTube is also working on “ratcheting up information from trusted sources and reducing the spread of videos with harmful misinformation.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I received a conditional green card after my wife and I got married in 2019. Recently, we have made the difficult decision to end our marriage. I want to continue living and working in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it still possible for me to complete my green card based on my marriage through the I-751 process or do I need to do something else, like ask my employer to sponsor me for a work visa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Better to Have Loved and Lost</strong></p>
<p>Dear Better,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear your marriage didn’t work out. Rest assured, you can still proceed with getting a full-fledged green card even though you and your wife are divorcing. Listen to my recent podcast with <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, my law partner, in which we discuss the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/085-removal-of-conditional-status-for-green-card-holders/">removal of conditions on permanent residence</a> for people who got two-year green cards through marriage.</p>
<p>As you know, since you were married for less than two years when you applied for your green card through marriage, you were issued a conditional green card that is only valid for two years rather than a 10-year green card. The purpose of the I-751 is to show that the couple entered into a genuine, good faith marriage. Usually, couples must file an I-751 petition together. However, an individual may file a petition without a spouse if any of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the marriage ended through annulment or divorce.</li>
<li>If the U.S. citizen spouse died.</li>
<li>If the conditional resident (and/or children) was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your divorce is not yet finalized and you don’t have a family law attorney yet, I do recommend that you work with a family law attorney, who is necessary to help streamline the process. I also recommend consulting an immigration attorney as soon as possible to prepare the I-751 filing since it can get tricky for an individual in divorce proceedings. Both need to work together and in parallel to ensure that everything goes smoothly for you with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>

<h2>When to file to remove conditions on permanent residence</h2>
<p>The I-751 should be filed within the 90-day period before your conditional green card is set to expire. I recommend filing as soon as you can within that window. Keep in mind that, if you file your I-751 petition too early, it may be returned to you. And if you file it after your conditional green card expires, you not only face having to leave the U.S., but USCIS could also deny your petition if you fail to provide a compelling reason. If you are in this situation, definitely let your immigration attorney know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A London-headquartered startup called <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/">LOVE</a>, valued at $17 million following its pre-seed funding, aims to redefine how people stay in touch with close family and friends. The company is launching <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love/id1454778314">a messaging app</a> that offers a combination of video calling as well as asynchronous video and audio messaging, in an ad-free, privacy-focused experience with a number of bells and whistles, including artistic filters and real-time transcription and translation features.</p>
<p>But LOVE&#8217;s bigger differentiator may not be its product alone, but rather the company&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p>LOVE aims for its product direction to be guided by its user base in a democratic fashion as opposed to having the decisions made about its future determined by an elite few at the top of some corporate hierarchy. In addition, the company&#8217;s longer-term goal is ultimately to hand over ownership of the app and its governance to its users, the company says.</p>
<p>These concepts have emerged as part of bigger trends towards a sort of &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=63d0e9f158df">Web 3.0,</a>&#8221; or next phase of internet development, where services are decentralized, user privacy is elevated, data is protected and transactions take place on digital ledgers, like a blockchain, in a more distributed fashion.</p>
<p>LOVE&#8217;s founders are proponents of this new model, including serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantharadocchia/">Samantha Radocchia</a>, who previously founded three companies and was an early advocate for the blockchain as the co-founder of <a href="https://www.chronicled.com/">Chronicled</a>, an enterprise blockchain company focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s been interested in emerging technology since her days of writing her anthropology thesis on currency exchanges in &#8220;Second Life&#8217;s&#8221; virtual world, she&#8217;s now faculty at Singularity University, where she&#8217;s given talks about blockchain, AI, Internet of Things, Future of Work, and other topics. She&#8217;s also authored an introductory guide to the blockchain with her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Pizza-No-Bullshit-Guide-Blockchain-ebook/dp/B07TYHKVLF">book</a> &#8220;Bitcoin Pizza.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schlaeffer/?locale=en_US">Christopher Schlaeffer</a>, meanwhile, held a number of roles at Deutsche Telekom, including chief product &amp; innovation officer, corporate development officer and chief strategy officer, where he along with Google execs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/23/t-mobile-g1-launch-liveblog/">introduced</a> the first mobile phone to run Android. He was also chief digital officer at the telecommunication services company VEON.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two crossed paths after Schlaeffer had already begun the work of organizing a team to bring LOVE to the public, which includes co-founders Chief Technologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-reeves-aa5b7834/">Jim Reeves</a>, also previously of VEON, and Chief Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kekeritz/">Timm Kekeritz</a>, previously an interaction designer at international design firm IDEO in San Francisco, design director at IXDS and founder of design consultancy Raureif in Berlin, among other roles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193998" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193998" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193998 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png 6210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=1536,665 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=2048,886 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193998" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LOVE</p></div></p>
<p>Explained Radocchia, what attracted her to join as CEO was the potential to create a new company that upholds more positive values than what&#8217;s often seen today &#8212; in fact, the brand name &#8220;LOVE&#8221; is a reference to this aim. She was also interested in the potential to think through what she describes as &#8220;new business models that are not reliant on advertising or harvesting the data of our users,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>To that end, LOVE plans to monetize <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/privacy-policy">without any advertising</a>. While the company isn&#8217;t ready to explain its business model in full, it would <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/blog/the-future-internet-will-be-powered-by-context-and-the-context-is-you">involve users opting in to services</a> through granular permissions and membership, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>“We believe our users will much rather be willing to pay for services they consciously use and grant permissions to in a given context than have their data used for an advertising model which is simply not transparent,&#8221; says Radocchia.</p>
<p>LOVE expects to share more about the model next year.</p>
<p>As for the LOVE app itself, it&#8217;s a fairly polished mobile messenger offering an interesting combination of features. Like any other video chat app, you can video call with friends and family, either in one-on-one calls or in groups. Currently, LOVE supports up to five call participants, but expects to expand that as it scales. The app also supports video and audio messaging for asynchronous conversations. There are already tools that offer this sort of functionality on the market, of course &#8212; like WhatsApp, with its support for audio messages, or video messenger <a href="https://www.marcopolo.me/">Marco Polo.</a> But they don&#8217;t offer quite the same expanded feature set.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193996" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193996" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2193996" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193996" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LOVE</p></div></p>
<p>For starters, LOVE limits its video messages to 60 seconds, for brevity&#8217;s sake. (As anyone who&#8217;s used Marco Polo knows, videos can become a bit rambling, which makes it harder to catch up when you&#8217;re behind on group chats.) In addition, LOVE allows you to both watch the video content as well as read the real-time transcription of what&#8217;s being said &#8212; the latter which comes in handy not only for accessibility&#8217;s sake, but also for those times you want to hear someone&#8217;s messages but aren&#8217;t in a private place to listen or don&#8217;t have headphones. Conversations can also be translated into 50 languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the traditional communication or messenger products are coming from a paradigm that has always been text-based,&#8221; explains Radocchia. &#8220;We&#8217;re approaching it completely differently. So while other platforms have a lot of the features that we do, I think that&#8230;the perspective that we&#8217;ve approached it has completely flipped it on its head,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;As opposed to bolting video messages on to a primarily text-based interface, [LOVE is] actually doing it in the opposite way and adding text as a sort of a magically transcribed add-on &#8212; and something that you never, hopefully, need to be typing out on your keyboard again,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s user interface, meanwhile, has been designed to encourage eye-to-eye contact with the speaker to make conversations feel more natural. It does this by way of design elements where bubbles float around as you&#8217;re speaking and the bubble with the current speaker grows to pull your focus away from looking at yourself. The company is also working with the curator of <a href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/">Serpentine Gallery</a> in London, Hans Ulrich-Obrist, to create new filters that aren&#8217;t about beautification or gimmicks, but are instead focused on introducing a new form of visual expression that makes people feel more comfortable on camera.</p>
<p>For the time being, this has resulted in a filter that slightly abstracts your appearance, almost in the style of animation or some other form of visual arts.</p>
<p>The app claims to use end-to-end encryption and the automatic deletion of its content after seven days &#8212; except for messages you yourself recorded, if you&#8217;ve chosen to save them as &#8220;memorable moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our commitments is to privacy and the right-to-forget,&#8221; says Radocchia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be or need to be storing any of this information.&#8221;</p>
<p>LOVE has been soft-launched on the App Store, where it&#8217;s been used with a number of testers and is working to organically grow its user base through an onboarding invite mechanism that asks users to invite at least three people to join. This same onboarding process also carefully explains why LOVE asks for permissions &#8212; like using speech recognition to create subtitles.</p>
<p>LOVE says its valuation is around $17 million USD following pre-seed investments from a combination of traditional startup investors and strategic angel investors across a variety of industries, including tech, film, media, TV and financial services. The company will raise a seed round this fall.</p>
<p>The app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love/id1454778314">currently available on iOS</a>, but an Android version will arrive later in the year. (Note that LOVE does not currently support the iOS 15 beta software, where it has issues with speech transcription and in other areas. That should be resolved next week, following an app update now in the works.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after Elastic announced the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of build.security, the company is making yet another security acquisition. As part of its second-quarter earnings announcement this afternoon, Elastic disclosed that it is acquiring Vancouver, Canada based security vendor CMD. Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cmd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s technology provides runtime security for cloud infrastructure, helping organizations gain better visibility into processes that are running. The startup was founded in 2016 and has raised $21.6 million in funding to date. The company&#8217;s last round was a </span><a href="https://medium.com/cmd-security/changing-cybersecurity-announcing-our-15-million-funding-led-by-gv-81bd27e18610"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was announced in 2019, led by</span><a href="https://www.gv.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GV.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic CEO and co-founder Shay Banon told TechCrunch that his company will be welcoming the employees of CMD into his company, but did not disclose precisely how many would be coming over. CMD CEO and co-founder Santosh Krishan and his fellow co-founder Jake King will both be taking executive roles within Elastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both build.security and CMD are set to become part of Elastic&#8217;s security organization. The two technologies will be integrated into the Elastic Stack platform that provides visibility into what an organization is running, as well as security insights to help limit risk. Elastic has been steadily growing its security capabilities in recent years, acquiring</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/elastic-adds-endpoint-security-to-its-expanding-toolset/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Endgame Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 for $234 million.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H5JPEFI6nm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/">Elastic acquires build.security for security policy definition and enforcement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elastic acquires build.security for security policy definition and enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/embed/#?secret=H5JPEFI6nm" data-secret="H5JPEFI6nm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banon explained that, as organizations increasingly move to the cloud and make use of Kubernetes, they are looking for more layers of introspection and protection for Linux. That&#8217;s where CMD&#8217;s technology comes in. CMD’s security service is built with an open source technology known as</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With eBPF, it&#8217;s possible to hook into a Linux operating system for visibility and security control. Work is currently ongoing to extend eBPF for Windows workloads, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD isn&#8217;t the only startup that has been building based on eBP. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isovalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/with-29m-in-funding-isovalent-launches-its-cloud-native-networking-and-security-platform-based-on-ebpf-and-cilium/">$29 million Series A round</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz and Google in November 2020, is also active in the space. The Linux Foundation also recently announced the creation of an</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/members/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the participation of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix and Isovalent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, Banon sees a clear alignment between what CMD was building and what Elastic aims to deliver for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a saying at Elastic &#8211; while you observe, why not protect?&#8221; Banon said. &#8220;With CMD if you look at everything that they do, they also have this deep passion and belief that it starts with observability. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take time for Elastic to integrate the CMD technology into the Elastic Stack, though it won&#8217;t be too long. Banon noted that one of the benefits of acquiring a startup is that it&#8217;s often easier to integrate than a larger, more established vendor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With all of these acquisitions that we make we spend time integrating them into a single product line,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means Elastic needs to take the technology that other companies have built and fold it into its stack and that sometimes can take time, Banon explained. He noted that it took two years to integrate the Endgame technology after that acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Typically that lends itself to us joining forces with smaller companies with really innovative technology that can be more easily taken and integrated into our stack,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>

<p>“A major challenge of debris removal, and on-orbit servicing in general, is docking with or capturing a client object; this test demonstration served as a successful validation of ELSA-d’s ability to dock with a client, such as a defunct satellite,” the company explained.</p>
<p>The demonstration today showed that the servicer &#8212; a model of Astroscale’s future product &#8212; can successfully magnetically capture and release other spacecraft.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end for the ELSA-d demonstration mission; the servicer and client still must hit three more capture-and-release milestones before Astroscale can call it a complete success. Next up, the servicer must safely release the client and re-capture it from a greater distance away. After that, Astroscale will attempt the same release-and-capture process, but this time with the client satellite simulating an uncontrolled, tumbling space object. The final capture demonstration the company is calling “diagnosis and client search,” in which the servicer will inspect the client from a close distance, move away, then approach and re-capture.</p>

<p>Astroscale is one of a suite of companies working on the problem of orbital debris, but it’s the first to send up a debris removal demonstration mission. According to NASA, over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network sensors. The amount of junk in space is only anticipated to grow as the cost of launching a spacecraft, and other expenses, continue to decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is affecting farming all over the world, and solutions are seldom simple. But if you could plant crops that resisted the heat, cold or drought instead of moving a thousand miles away, wouldn&#8217;t you? <a href="https://www.avalo.ai/">Avalo</a> helps plants like these become a reality using AI-powered genome analysis that can reduce the time and money it takes to breed hardier plants for this hot century.</p>
<p>Founded by two friends who thought they&#8217;d take a shot at a startup before committing to a life of academia, Avalo has a very direct value proposition, but it takes a bit of science to understand it.</p>
<p>Big seed and agriculture companies put a lot of work into creating better versions of major crops. By making corn or rice ever so slightly more resistant to heat, insects, drought or flooding, they can make huge improvements to yields and profits for farmers, or alternatively make a plant viable to grow somewhere it couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are big decreases to yields in equatorial areas — and it&#8217;s not that corn kernels are getting smaller,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Brendan Collins. &#8220;Farmers move upland because salt water intrusion is disrupting fields, but they run into early spring frosts that kill their seedlings. Or they need rust resistant wheat to survive fungal outbreaks in humid, wet summers. We need to create new varieties if we want to adapt to this new environmental reality.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To make those improvements in a systematic way, researchers emphasize existing traits in the plant; this isn&#8217;t about splicing in a new gene but bringing out qualities that are already there. This used to be done by the simple method of growing several plants, comparing them, and planting the seeds of the one that best exemplifies the trait — like Mendel in Genetics 101.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In an increasingly hot biotech market, protecting IP is key&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/in-an-increasingly-hot-biotech-market-protecting-ip-is-key/embed/#?secret=Hr1RQsHRi6" data-secret="Hr1RQsHRi6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nowadays, however, we have sequenced the genome of these plants and can be a little more direct. By finding out which genes are active in the plants with a desired trait, better expression of those genes can be targeted for future generations. The problem is that doing this still takes a long time — as in a decade.</p>
<p>The difficult part of the modern process stems (so to speak) from the issue that <em>traits</em>, like survival in the face of a drought, aren&#8217;t just single genes. They may be any number of genes interacting in a complex way. Just as there&#8217;s no single gene for becoming an Olympic gymnast, there isn&#8217;t one for becoming drought-resistant rice. So when the companies do what are called genome-wide association studies, they end up with hundreds of candidates for genes that contribute to the trait, and then must laboriously test various combinations of these in living plants, which even at industrial rates and scales takes years to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ability to just find genes and then do something with them is actually pretty limited as these traits become more complicated,&#8221; said Mariano Alvarez, co-founder and CSO of Avalo. &#8220;Trying to increase the efficiency of an enzyme is easy, you just go in with CRISPR and edit it — but increasing yield in corn, there are thousands, maybe millions of genes contributing to that. If you&#8217;re a big strategic [e.g., Monsanto] trying to make drought-tolerant rice, you&#8217;re looking at 15 years, 200 million dollars … it&#8217;s a long play.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where Avalo steps in. The company has built a model for simulating the effects of changes to a plant&#8217;s genome, which they claim can reduce that 15-year lead time to two or three and the cost by a similar ratio.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was to create a much more realistic model for the genome that&#8217;s more evolutionarily aware,&#8221; said Collins. That is, a system that models the genome and genes on it that includes more context from biology and evolution. With a better model, you get far fewer false positives on genes associated with a trait, because it rules out far more as noise, unrelated genes, minor contributors and so on.</p>
<p>He gave the example of a cold-tolerant rice strain that one company was working on. A genomewide association study found 566 &#8220;genes of interest,&#8221; and to investigate each costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $40,000 due to the time, staff and materials required. That means investigating this one trait might run up a $20 million tab over several years, which naturally limits both the parties who can even attempt such an operation, and the crops that they will invest the time and money in. If you expect a return on investment, you can&#8217;t spend that kind of cash improving a niche crop for an outlier market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to democratize that process,&#8221; said Collins. In that same body of data relating to cold-tolerant rice, &#8220;We found 32 genes of interest, and based on our simulations and retrospective studies, we know that all of those are truly causal. And we were able to grow 10 knockouts to validate them, three in a three-month period.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193984" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193984" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193984 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png" alt="" width="1000" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193984" class="wp-caption-text">In each graph, dots represent confidence levels in genes that must be tested. The Avalo model clears up the data and selects only the most promising ones. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>To unpack the jargon a little there, from the start Avalo&#8217;s system ruled out more than 90% of the genes that would have had to be individually investigated. They had high confidence that these 32 genes were not just related, but causal — having a real effect on the trait. And this was borne out with brief &#8220;knockout&#8221; studies, where a particular gene is blocked and the effect of that studied. Avalo calls its method &#8220;gene discovery via informationless perturbations,&#8221; or GDIP.</p>
<p>Part of it is the inherent facility of machine learning algorithms when it comes to pulling signal out of noise, but Collins noted that they needed to come at the problem with a fresh approach, letting the model learn the structures and relationships on its own. And it was also important to them that the model be explainable — that is, that its results don&#8217;t just appear out of a black box but have some kind of justification.</p>
<p>This latter issue is a tough one, but they achieved it by systematically swapping out genes of interest in repeated simulations with what amount to dummy versions, which don&#8217;t disrupt the trait but do help the model learn what each gene is contributing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193983" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193983" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg 2739w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1199 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193983" class="wp-caption-text">Avalo co-founders Mariano Alvarez (left) and Brendan Collins by a greenhouse. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Using our tech, we can come up with a minimal predictive breeding set for traits of interest. You can design the perfect genotype in silico [i.e., in simulation] and then do intensive breeding and watch for that genotype,&#8221; said Collins. And the cost is low enough that it can be done by smaller outfits or with less popular crops, or for traits that are outside possibilities — since climate change is so unpredictable, who can say whether heat- or cold-tolerant wheat would be better 20 years from now?</p>
<p>&#8220;By reducing the capital cost of undertaking this exercise, we sort of unlock this space where it&#8217;s economically viable to work on a climate-tolerant trait,&#8221; said Alvarez.</p>
<p><span class="il">Avalo</span> is partnering with several universities to accelerate the creation of other resilient and sustainable plants that might never have seen the light of day otherwise. These research groups have tons of data but not a lot of resources, making them excellent candidates to demonstrate the company&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>The university partnerships will also establish that the system works for &#8220;fairly undomesticated&#8221; plants that need some work before they can be used at scale. For instance it might be better to supersize a wild grain that&#8217;s naturally resistant to drought instead of trying to add drought resistance to a naturally large grain species, but no one was willing to spend $20 million to find out.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, they plan to offer the data handling service first, one of many startups offering big cost and time savings to slower, more established companies in spaces like agriculture and pharmaceuticals. With luck Avalo will be able to help bring a few of these plants into agriculture and become a seed provider as well.</p>
<p>The company just emerged from the IndieBio accelerator a few weeks ago and has already secured $3 million in seed funding to continue their work at greater scale. The round was co-led by Better Ventures and Giant Ventures, with At One Ventures, Climate Capital, David Rowan and of course IndieBio parent SOSV participating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brendan convinced me that starting a startup would be way more fun and interesting than applying for faculty jobs,&#8221; said Alvarez. &#8220;And he was totally right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kanye (or <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-west-files-to-change-his-name-to-ye/">“Ye,” as it were</a>) is going all out in the promotion of his upcoming tenth studio album, &#8220;Donda&#8221; (named for his late-mother, Donda West). In July, there was a massive listening party at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium (where he also took up residence in a locker room). For an upcoming listening party in his native Chicago, meanwhile, the rapper is <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/kanye-west-rebuilds-childhood-home-for-donda-listening-event-at-soldier-field-thursday-photos-show/2597155/">rebuilding his childhood home at Soldier Field</a>.</p>
<p>The forthcoming LP also sees West launching a $200 music gadget called,<a href="https://www.kanyewest.com/"> Stem Player</a>, under his Yeezy Tech brand. The product is designed to isolate stems &#8212; specific elements like vocals, bass, samples and drums. It can add effects and remix the song elements according to the site.</p>
<p>The device reportedly ships with a copy of the new record pre-loaded. A FAQ on the site helpfully adds, however, while the product is being released in conjunction with &#8220;Donda,&#8221; it can also be used for other music.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg 1872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-25-at-2.17.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kanye West</p></div></p>
<p>Interestingly, the device was created in tandem with Kano, a London-based startup known for a different kind of STEM product. The company creates educational devices to help children learn things like programming. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/kid-focused-stem-device-startup-kano-sees-layoffs-as-it-puts-disney-e-device-on-ice/">Kano struggled through layoffs</a>, in spite of releasing a number of Disney-branded devices.</p>
<p>It seems the company’s found an interesting new bit of life here, and the product even goes so far as crediting Kano on the back of its silicone skin exterior with a Yeezy Tech x Kano branding on the rear.</p>
<p>West name-checked the device (or its predecessor) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOCvKvrwI8">during an interview</a> around his previous album, &#8220;Jesus Is King&#8221; in 2019. At the time, it appeared to be a collaboration with design firm Teenage Engineering. “This portable stem player that we designed with Teenage Engineering for this album and the albums before it, is to spread the gospel,” West told Zane Lowe at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product is set to ship this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can an old Terminal learn new tricks? <a href="https://fig.io">Fig</a>, a company out of Y Combinator’s S20 class, has raised a $2.2M seed round to prove that it can. Their goal: augment (but don’t try to replace) the command line terminal that so many people use every day and make it more powerful and easy to use — especially for teams.</p>
<p>The first of these augmentations is autocomplete. Start typing your command and it’ll respond with a narrowing drop down of things that might complete it, saving you the keystrokes, time and brain juice required to perfectly remember the myriad terminal commands you might use throughout your work day.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re changing directories, for example, it can help finish paths as you type; with Git, it can keep track of your most recently tapped branches. If you find yourself punching in the same Google Cloud or AWS commands 10 times a day, it&#8217;ll put them a tap away. The autocomplete functionality tied to each command line tool can be <a href="https://fig.io/docs/getting-started">tweaked to your liking</a> and shared with the wider community. Everything can be done without taking your hands off the keyboard, for those who tend to avoid reaching for a mouse.</p>
<p>Autocomplete is a great feature, though perhaps not enough to fuel an entire company — but it’s just step one, says the team. Fig founder Brendan Falk tells me the goal is to build out an “app ecosystem” for companies that use the terminal as a key part of their daily workflow, charging teams a monthly subscription fee. They’ve built a platform for shareable Markdown-based apps that can a user can launch from the terminal, giving them a visual interface that can be filled out and adjusted before piping output back into the terminal. Autocomplete, as they see it, is just the foot in the door.</p>
<p>“Suddenly I’ve written a little script, but it’s visual, it’s discoverable, I can share that with my team,” says Falk. “Building these internal tools for your development team is really where we want to go here … things like sharing scripts, sharing deployment workflows, sharing monitoring commands. All of this boilerplate stuff that is spread throughout your system, that really is focused within your terminal and should be contained within the terminal.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tweet from Fig showing that visual interface in motion:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The team didn&#8217;t initially set out with their sights set on the terminal. Falk tells me that he and co-founder Matt Schrage had pivoted from idea to idea for months, building out things like a personal CRM, prediction markets and a stock exchange for creators. &#8220;We had all of the bad college kid ideas,&#8221; Falk says, &#8220;but they were just not problems we had. They were ideas, as opposed to problems people had.&#8221;</p>
<p>A bunch of pivots later, says Falk, they realized that each pivot had them back in the terminal typing the same commands, following the same complicated workflows to spin up a new project. &#8220;The last major changes to the terminal were in 1978, and it hasn&#8217;t really changed much since.&#8221; notes Falk. &#8220;Yet literally every hardware engineer, software engineer, data scientist is using it.&#8221; Could <em>that</em> be the problem they went after?</p>
<p>It seems there&#8217;s an audience for it; while Fig is still in private beta, Falk tells me they currently have tens of thousands of users on the waitlist to get access.</p>
<p>This round was led by General Catalyst, and backed by YC, SV Angel, a partner at Kleiner Perkins and a bevy of current/former tech execs including Adobe CPO Scott Belsky, Stripe CPO Will Gaybrick, Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel, former Github CTO Jason Warner, former Heroku CEO Adam Gross, Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen and Eventbrite founder Kevin Hartz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fig works with macOS’ built-in terminal app out of the box, but they’ve also got add-on integrations to make it work within things like VSCode, Hyper and iTerm. It won’t work on <a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/35">Windows</a> or <a href="https://github.com/withfig/fig/issues/34">Linux</a> just yet, but the team says support for them is on the roadmap.</p>

Perhaps that is also due the widely reported <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2021/07/how-has-the-global-chip-shortage-impacted-the-pc-industry-so-far/">worldwide chip shortage</a>.</p>
<p>HP retained top spot for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/u-s-pc-shipments-soar-73-in-the-first-quarter-as-apple-falls-from-top-spot/">the second straight quarter</a> with 21.9% of the market, up over 20% from the previous year. Apple remained in the second spot with a 20.6% share. It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that Apple&#8217;s growth fell -2.8% for the year.</p>
<p>Dell was in third place with 15.6%, followed by Lenovo with 12.4%. If you&#8217;re looking at yearly growth rate, Samsung had the highest with over 50%, but that translated into just over 6% market share.</p>

<p>Brian Lynch, research analyst at Canalys, is optimistic that the pandemic-fueled growth we have been seeing in this market throughout 2020 and 2021 will continue and that consumer refreshes could be on the horizon as the economy continues to rebound.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commercial and education segments have exploded, triggering tremendous refresh potential. The U.S. economy has bounced back well from its pandemic woes and small businesses are recovering, which will lead to a wave of purchasing from the segment,&#8221; Lynch said in a statement.</p>
<p>Overall there were 36.8 million units sold and that includes notebooks, which were up 27%; desktops, which were up 23%; and tablets, which were basically stagnant with growth actually down 1%. Canalys attributed this drop to the education market moving away from tablets and the fact that many people bought tablets when they were stuck at home, but won&#8217;t be refreshing quickly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In spite of this, Apple remains firmly in charge in the tablet market with a 45% share, while Amazon is well back in second place with 22% followed by Samsung with 18%.</p>
<p>It seems clear that even though more people may be returning to in-person learning and in-office work at some point, many schools and businesses will continue to take a hybrid or even fully remote approach and that should bode well for the PC industry, especially whenever the chip shortage finally abates.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">More than 10 companies currently compete across Europe with an instant grocery delivery business model. Half of them were established in 2020, the year of the pandemic. These companies have raised more than $2 billion to date.</p>
<p>Existing and well-funded online food-delivery service players like Delivery Hero are also joining the race by launching dedicated grocery offerings. However, if lessons from the world’s largest online grocery market, China ($400 billion), matter, then it’s clear that instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance of Europe’s incumbent supermarket chains in the overall $2 trillion-plus flat market.</p>
<p>Instead, China’s quick-commerce equivalents (like Dingdong Maicai, Miss Fresh and Meituan Maicai) compete alongside a wealth of other online grocery models (such as Pinduoduo, JD’s Super and Alibaba’s Taoxianda), which have helped bring total market penetration to 20% and beyond.</p>
<p>Quick commerce suffers from narrower profit margins compared to competing models and is addressing lower consumer demand in China than anyone in the West is expecting it to achieve in Europe and the U.S. If the performance of online grocery platforms in China (a market five to seven years ahead of Europe in terms of online retail) is anything to go by, a range of B2C business models would be more likely to displace the traditional grocery retailers.</p>
<h2>Third-time luck for quick commerce?</h2>
<p>The idea of ordering groceries online and having them delivered to consumers in less than an hour is nothing new. Back in the heyday of the dot-com bubble, a company attempted to do just that: Kozmo.com. Founded in 1998, it raised more than $250 million (around $400 million in today’s dollars) from investors, promising to deliver food, among other items, to consumers within an hour, while charging no delivery fees.</p>
<p>In 1999, it had revenues of $3.5 million and a loss of $1.8 million. However, in 2001, the business was shut down by its board after the company could not make the business model work at scale.</p>
<p>Some 15 years later, another company had a go. Gopuff was established in Philadelphia in 2013 and originally targeted students. What started out as a hookah delivery service soon expanded into a much broader convenience store offering and delivered to customers in approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Gopuff was most recently valued at $15 billion after raising a total of $3.4 billion — 75% of which occurred in the past 12 months. Last year, Gopuff grew revenues from around $100 million to $340 million.</p>
<p>Kozmo.com went out of business after just three years. Meanwhile, Gopuff was turned down by several VCs in its early days, and it wasn’t until the pandemic that it saw a rapid acceleration in fundraising. Little did teams at either company know that they would later become the inspiration for a whole generation of founders in Europe.</p>
<h2>Europe’s $2B instant-grocery gamble</h2>
<p>Has anything fundamentally changed in the 20 years since Kozmo.com? Indeed, we’ve seen little technological progress that would hugely affect the operations of an instant commerce business. However, there have been much larger shifts in consumer habits.</p>
<p>Firstly, the number of global internet users has skyrocketed (from below 500 million to beyond 4 billion), and mobile internet has taken over. Secondly, demand for online grocery delivery has grown significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers have preferred to make retail purchases from home for safety reasons. Thirdly, consumers are now accustomed to paying fees for delivery services, typically around $2 per order, which Kozmo notoriously did not do.</p>
<p>While many online grocery business models exist, the instant grocery, quick-commerce approach has been the favorite of European entrepreneurs and VCs over the past 18 months. The model itself, also referred to as q-commerce, is not that hard to understand.</p>
<p>Companies maintain a small product offering of around 1,000–2,000 SKUs that consumers would otherwise find in convenience or drug stores. These products are purchased directly from brands or through distributors and are stored in self-operated microwarehouses close to customers’ locations.</p>
<p>Marketing tactics are aggressive, often employing vouchers for first-time users of up to $12 (50% of an average shopping basket), and many startups offer their products at supermarket price or even at a discount of 10%–15%. Delivery usually happens by bicycle, e-bike or scooter, within 10-30 minutes of an order being placed, for a fee of around $2 with no minimum order value.</p>
<p>Companies like Getir from Istanbul (total funding: $1 billion, last valuation: $7.5 billion) and Gorillas from Berlin (total funding: $335 million, last valuation: $1 billion) are leading the way. When Gorillas announced its $290 million Series B in March 2021, it became the fastest European startup to achieve unicorn status (nine months after launch). The company is already rumored to be seeking Series C financing at a $2.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>There are more than 10 companies across Europe with more or less the same business model. Those include the 2020-established Flink (Germany-based, $300 million raised), Zapp (U.K.-based, $100 million raised), Dija (U.K.-based, $20 million raised and just acquired by Gopuff), Jiffy (U.K.-based, $7 million raised) and Cajoo (France-based, $6 million raised).</p>
<p>There is also JOKR, which was started by the founder of Foodpanda. JOKR was only established in Q1 2021, but right after incorporation raised one of the largest ever initial seed rounds (rumored to be $100 million) and subsequently a $170 million Series A in July to bring the model to Europe, Latin America and the U.S.</p>
<p>Likewise, companies coming from food delivery have pushed further into this space and received additional funding in recent months, notably Delivery Hero through Dmart and Glovo through SuperGlovo, following role models in the U.S., such as DoorDash.</p>
<h2>Does instant grocery stand a chance of becoming profitable?</h2>
<p>As these companies approach later-stage financing sometime in the future, questions will be asked about the path to profitability in an industry of notoriously thin margins. Indeed, this is an uncomfortable truth that hasn’t changed since the early days of Kozmo.com.</p>
<p>The available figures show that old patterns are repeating. Gopuff recently reported an EBITDA of negative $150 million on $340 million in revenue (EBITDA margin: -45%). Furthermore, an analysis by the German business monthly Manager Magazine concluded that Gorillas was operating at negative unit economics of -6%. Additional costs, such as overhead and technology, might push this number up significantly further.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Hulu has started adding support for HDR viewing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/youtube-will-join-netflix-and-amazon-with-support-for-hdr-video/?_ga=2.185109295.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">years after</a> some of its competitors. The gradual rollout of HDR support began on August 19, Hulu told TechCrunch, and should be available to all users with HDR-compatible devices in the coming days.</p>
<p>So far, Hulu has only enabled HDR viewing on high-profile original content, like &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers,&#8221; but the streaming service said that it will continue adding HDR support to both new and existing content over time.</p>
<p>If a viewer is using an HDR-compatible device, a badge will appear on a show&#8217;s details page, indicating that it can be streamed in HDR. Per Hulu&#8217;s <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality#HDR">support page</a> &#8212; which is where users spotted the feature&#8217;s quiet rollout &#8212; HDR content on the Hulu app is supported with HDR-compatible models of Roku, Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube, Apple TV 4K, Vizio and Chromecast Ultra. Hulu told TechCrunch that &#8220;it is recommended that viewers update their devices to the latest version for the best experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hulu has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/hulu-brings-back-4k-content/">historically been slower</a> than its competitors to enable support for technology like HDR, which provides an enhanced viewing experience. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">HDR isn&#8217;t a resolution like 4K, but rather, it creates a more natural-looking image by expanding its contrast ratio and color palette. </span>YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/youtube-will-join-netflix-and-amazon-with-support-for-hdr-video/?_ga=2.185109295.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">rolled out HDR support</a> in 2016, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/24/amazon-prime-instant-video-adds-limited-support-for-hdr/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=sfgplus&amp;%3Fncid=sfgplus&amp;_ga=2.112576386.748415581.1629728212-1532633466.1621860309">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/netflix-introduces-hdr-video">Netflix</a> enabled the feature within the previous year. Though Disney+ and Hulu share a parent company in Disney, Disney+ has already <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;sys_kb_id=7dfe2218db0d40d03c0cf158bf96190e">supported HDR</a> for some of its content.</p>
<p>Some streaming services like Netflix offer <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926">pricier monthly subscription</a> plans for access to HD or Ultra HD content, but as of now, Hulu doesn&#8217;t <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/how-much-does-hulu-cost">charge a premium</a> for access to higher-quality streaming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Those at risk are always vigilant for the signs of a stroke in progress, but no one can be vigilant when they&#8217;re sleeping, meaning thousands of people suffer &#8220;wake-up strokes&#8221; that are only identified hours after the fact. <a href="https://www.zeitmedical.com/">Zeit Medical&#8217;s</a> brain-monitoring wearable could help raise the alarm and get people to the hospital fast enough to mitigate the stroke&#8217;s damage and potentially save lives.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, there wasn&#8217;t much anyone could do to help a stroke victim. But an effective medication entered use in the &#8217;90s, and a little later a surgical procedure was also pioneered — but both need to be administered within a few hours of the stroke&#8217;s onset.</p>
<p>Orestis Vardoulis and Urs Naber started Zeit (&#8220;time&#8221;) after seeing the resources being put toward reducing the delay between a 911 call regarding a stroke and the victim getting the therapy needed. The company is part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that you couldn&#8217;t do anything, but suddenly it really mattered how fast you got to the hospital,&#8221; said Naber. &#8220;As soon as the stroke hits you, your brain starts dying, so time is the most crucial thing. People have spent millions shrinking the time between the 911 call and transport, and from the hospital door to treatment. but no one is addressing those hours that happen <em>before</em> the 911 call — so we realized that&#8217;s where we need to innovate.&#8221;</p>
<p>If only the stroke could be identified before the person even realizes it&#8217;s happening, they and others could be alerted and off to the hospital long before an ambulance would normally be called. As it turns out, there&#8217;s another situation where this needs to happen: in the OR.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193577" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193577" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193577" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png" alt="" width="1024" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=768,304 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=680,269 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stroke-pattern.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193577" class="wp-caption-text">For illustrative purposes, an EEG signal that changes its character can be detected quickly by the algorithm. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zeit</p></div></p>
<p>Surgeons and nurses performing operations obviously monitor the patient&#8217;s vitals closely and have learned to identify the signs of an impending stroke from the EEG monitoring their brainwaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are specific patterns that people are trained to catch with their eyes. We learned from the best neurologists out there how they process this data visually, and we built a tool to detect that automatically,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;This clinical experience really helped, because they assisted in defining features within the signal that helped us accelerate the process of deciding what is important and what is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team created a soft, wearable headband with a compact EEG built in that monitors the relevant signals from the brain. This data is sent to a smartphone app for analysis by a machine learning model trained on the aforementioned patterns, and if anything is detected, an alarm is sent to the user and pre-specified caregivers. It can also be set to automatically call 911.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vast majority of the data we have analyzed comes out of the OR,&#8221; said Vardoulis, where it can immediately be checked against the ground truth. &#8220;We saw that we have an algorithm that can robustly capture the onset of events in the OR with zero false positives.&#8221;</p>
<p>That should translate well to the home, they say, where there are actually fewer complicating variables. To test that, they&#8217;re working with a group of high-risk people who have already had one stroke; the months immediately following a stroke or related event (there are various clinically differentiated categories) is a dangerous one when second events are common.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right now we have a research kit that we&#8217;re shipping to individuals involved in our studies that has the headband and phone. Users are wearing it every night,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;We&#8217;re preparing for a path that will allow us to go commercial at some point in 2023. We&#8217;re working with he FDA to define the clinical proof needed to get this clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve earned a &#8220;Breakthrough Device&#8221; classification, which (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/brainq-raises-40m-to-transform-stroke-patient-rehabilitation-with-its-home-therapy-device/">like stroke rehabilitation company BrainQ</a>) puts them in position to move forward quickly with testing and certification.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to start in the U.S., but we see a need globally,&#8221; said Naber. &#8220;There are countries where aging is even more prevalent and the support structure for disability care is even less.&#8221; The device could significantly lower the risk and cost of at-home and disability care for many people who might otherwise have to regularly visit the hospital.</p>
<p>The plan for now is to continue to gather data and partners until they can set up a large-scale study, which will almost certainly be required to move the device from direct-to-consumer to reimbursable (i.e., covered by insurance). And although they are totally focused on strokes for the present, the method could be adapted to watching for other neurological conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope to see a future where everyone with a stroke risk is issued this device,&#8221; said Vardoulis. &#8220;We really do see this as the missing puzzle piece in the stroke care continuum.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has announced <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-invites-you-to-tudum-global-fan-event">Tudum</a>, a global virtual fan event set for September 25 that will showcase exclusive news and first looks at some of the streaming giant’s original content. Tudum, which is named after the sound users hear when they press play on Netflix, will feature stars and creators from over 70 Netflix series, films and specials.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s our first-ever global Tudum event, and our goal is simple: to entertain and honor Netflix fans from across the globe,” a spokesperson for Netflix told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s only one place to see your favorite stars reveal exclusive first looks of Netflix’s biggest shows and films&#8230; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TUDUM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TUDUM</a>: A Global Fan Event is coming September 25 <a href="https://t.co/moXnYqtxOD">pic.twitter.com/moXnYqtxOD</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Netflix (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1430530407729041409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The event will feature interactive panels and conversations with the creators and stars of some of Netflix’s most popular shows, including “Stranger Things,” “Emily in Paris,” “The Witcher,” “The Crown,” “Cobra Kai” and “Bridgerton.” Netflix will also feature some of its popular films including “Red Notice,” “Don’t Look Up,” “Extraction,” “The Harder They Fall,” “The Old Guard” and more.</p>
<p>Netflix is among several other major companies that have started hosting their own virtual events during the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift toward livestreamed programming. Disney+, for instance, held a special <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1263077012299628545">event to honor National Streaming Day</a> earlier this year in May. These types of events are becoming the new way for companies to showcase their original content, whereas in previous years they would do so at various in-person fan conventions.</p>
<p>With this new fan event and other similar ones such as <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/everything-to-know-about-geeked-week">Geeked Week</a>, Netflix is no longer relying on other programming or conventions to promote its original content as it can now host its own events. Tudum also seems to be a way for Netflix to acquire more subscribers by promoting popular returning shows and teasing upcoming content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The virtual livestream for the three-hour Tudum event starts at 12 p.m. EDT/9 a.m. PDT on Saturday, September 25. The event will be broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch. Netflix is also hosting special pre-shows to showcase its Korean and Indian original series and films along with its anime content at 8 a.m. EDT/5 a.m. PDT.</p>
<p>Netflix’s event announcement comes as the streaming giant has spent the past year expanding its service and adding new features. Recently, the platform has launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/netflix-launches-its-shuffle-feature-now-called-play-something-to-users-worldwide/">new &#8220;Play Something&#8221; shuffle feature</a>, a new section to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/netflix-aims-to-retain-subscribers-with-launch-of-a-feature-to-track-new-releases/">help users track upcoming releases</a> and a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/">&#8220;Downloads For You&#8221; feature</a> that automatically downloads content you&#8217;ll like. In terms of the future, Netflix has said its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/netflix-says-its-gaming-push-will-begin-with-mobile/">gaming push will begin with mobile</a> and that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/spatial-audio-is-coming-to-netflix-on-iphone-and-ipad/">plans to bring spatial audio</a> to the platform&#8217;s iPhone and iPad apps.</p>
