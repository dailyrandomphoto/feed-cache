										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai developed an in-car payment system that will debut in its upcoming all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover that will offer drivers the ability to find and pay for EV charging, food and parking — the latest example of automakers finding new ways to generate revenue and offer customers features that are typically associated with smartphones.</p>
<p>When the vehicle comes to North America in fall 2021, the payments system will launch with Dominoes, ParkWhiz and Chargehub, the company said Monday. The in-car payments system was just one of several new details released during the Ioniq 5&#8217;s North American debut.</p>
<p>The payments feature works through Bluelink, Hyundai&#8217;s branded connected car system that gives users control over various vehicle functions and services. Bluelink, which requires a subscription, is offered in three different packages that cover areas such as vehicle maintenance and alerts, remote climate control and unlocking and locking as well as destination search. Bluelink also can be linked to a user&#8217;s Google Assistant feature on their smartphone to send information to their Hyundai vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The in-car payments system will eventually expand to include other companies that fall into the charging, food and coffee on-the-go and parking categories. A company spokesperson said Hyundai will continue to add new merchants regularly via the Xevo Marketplace platform.</p>
<p>The Ioniq 5 is the company&#8217;s first dedicated battery-electric vehicle built on the new Electric-Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP platform. This platform is shared with Kia and is the underlying foundation of the new EV6.</p>
<p>If the Ioniq name sounds familiar, it’s because it already exists. In 2016, Hyundai introduced the Ioniq, a hatchback that came in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric versions. The Korean automaker is using that vehicle as the jumping off point for its new EV brand.</p>
<p>All of the vehicles under the Ioniq brand will have the E-GMP platform. The Ioniq 5 is based on Hyundai’s Concept 45, a monocoque-style body crossover that the company unveiled in 2019 at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt. Designers of the Concept 45 leaned on some of the lines and characteristics from Hyundai’s first concept, the 1974 Pony Coupe. The “45” name comes, in part, from the 45-degree angles at the front and rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Hyundai has yet to release pricing for the Ioniq 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Florida governor Ron DeSantis has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/05/24/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-to-stop-the-censorship-of-floridians-by-big-tech/">signed into law</a> a restriction on social media companies&#8217; ability to ban candidates for state offices and news outlets, and in doing so offered a direct challenge to those companies&#8217; perceived free speech rights. The law is almost certain to be challenged in court as both unconstitutional and in direct conflict with federal rules.</p>
<p>The law, Florida Senate Bill 7072, provides several new checks on tech and social media companies. Among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platforms cannot ban or deprioritize candidates for state office</li>
<li>Platforms cannot ban or deprioritize any news outlet meeting certain size requirements</li>
<li>Platforms must be transparent about moderation processes and give users notice of moderation actions</li>
<li>Users and the state will have the right to sue companies that violate the law. Statutory fines could be as high as $250,000 per day for some offenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The law establishes rules affecting these companies&#8217; moderation practices; that much is clear. But whether doing so amounts to censorship — actual government censorship, not the general concept of limitation frequently associated with the word — is an open question, if a somewhat obvious one, that will likely be forced by legal action against SB 7072.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there is a great deal of circumstantial precedent and analysis, the problem of &#8220;are moderation practices of social media companies protected by the First Amendment&#8221; is as yet unsettled. Legal scholars and existing cases fall strongly on the side of &#8220;yes,&#8221; but there is no single definitive precedent that Facebook or Twitter can point to.</p>
<p>The First Amendment argument starts with the idea that although social media are very unlike newspapers or book publishers, they are protected in much the same way by the Constitution from government interference. &#8220;Free speech&#8221; is a term that is interpreted extremely liberally, but if a company spending money is considered a protected expression of ideas, it&#8217;s not a stretch to suggest that same company applying a policy of hosting or not hosting content should be as well. If it is, then the government is prohibited from interfering with it beyond very narrow definitions of unprotected speech (think shouting &#8220;fire&#8221; in a crowded theater). That would sink Florida&#8217;s law on constitutional grounds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clarence Thomas plays a poor devil&#8217;s advocate in floating First Amendment limits for tech companies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clarence-thomas-plays-a-poor-devils-advocate-in-floating-first-amendment-limits-for-tech-companies/embed/#?secret=tcsQYn4wHp" data-secret="tcsQYn4wHp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other conflict is with federal law, specifically the much-discussed Section 230, which protects companies from being liable for content they publish (i.e. the creator is responsible instead), and also for the choice to take down content via rules of their own choice. As the law&#8217;s co-author Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has put it, this gives those companies both a shield and a sword with which to do battle against risky speech on their platforms.</p>
<p>But SB 7072 removes both sword and shield: it would limit who can be moderated, and also creates a novel cause for legal action against the companies for their remaining moderation practices.</p>
<p>Federal and state law are often in disagreement, and there is no handbook for how to reconcile them. On one hand, witness raids of state-legalized marijuana shops and farms by federal authorities. On the other, observe how strong consumer protection laws at the state level aren&#8217;t preempted by weaker federal ones because to do so would put people at risk.</p>

<p>On the matter of Section 230 it&#8217;s not straightforward who is protecting whom. Florida&#8217;s current state government claims that it is protecting &#8220;real Floridians&#8221; against the &#8220;Silicon Valley elites.&#8221; But no doubt those elites (and let us be candid — that is exactly what they are) will point out that in fact this is a clear-cut case of government overreach, censorship in the literal sense.</p>
<p>These strong legal objections will inform the inevitable lawsuits by the companies affected, which will probably be filed ahead of the law taking effect and aim to have it overturned.</p>
<p>Interestingly, two companies that will not be affected by the law are two of the biggest, most uncompromising corporations in the world: Disney and Comcast. Why, you ask? Because the law has a special exemption for any company &#8220;that owns and operates a theme park or entertainment complex&#8221; of a certain size.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s a Mouse-shaped hole in this law — and Comcast, which owns Universal Studios, just happens to fit through as well. Notably this was added in an amendment, suggesting two of the largest employers in the state were unhappy at the idea of new liabilities for any of their digital properties.</p>
<p>This naked pandering to local corporate donors puts proponents of this law at something of an ethical disadvantage in their righteous battle against the elites, but favor may be moot in a few months&#8217; time when the legal challenges, probably being drafted at this moment, call for an injunction against SB 7072.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zocdoc says it has fixed a bug that allowed current and former staff at doctor&#8217;s offices and dental practices to access patient data because their user accounts weren&#8217;t properly decommissioned.</p>
<p>The New York-based company revealed the issue <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20787225-zocdoc-security-incident?20787225">in a letter</a> to the California attorney general&#8217;s office, which requires companies with more than 500 residents of the state affected by a security lapse or breach to disclose the incident.</p>
<p>Zocdoc, which lets prospective patients book appointments with doctors and dentists, said that it gives each medical or dental practice usernames and passwords for its staff to access appointments made through Zocdoc, but that &#8220;programming errors&#8221; — essentially a software bug in Zocdoc&#8217;s own systems — &#8220;allowed some past or current practice staff members to access the provider portal after their usernames and passwords were intended to be removed, deleted or otherwise limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter confirmed that patient data stored in Zocdoc&#8217;s portal could have been accessed, including a patient&#8217;s name, email address, phone number, and the times and dates of their appointments, but also other data that may have been shared with the practice — such as insurance details, Social Security numbers and details of the patient&#8217;s medical history.</p>
<p>But Zocdoc said payment card numbers, radiological or diagnostic reports, and medical records were not taken, since it does not store this data.</p>
<p>In an email, Zocdoc spokesperson Sandra Glading said that the company discovered the bug in August 2020, but &#8220;due to the complexity of the code, it took a significant amount of investigation to determine which, if any, practices and users were affected and how.&#8221; The company said it provided notice to the California&#8217;s attorney general&#8217;s office &#8220;as soon as was practicable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zocdoc said it has &#8220;detailed logs that can detect exploitation of any data, including any potential exploitation of this vulnerability,&#8221; and that after a review of those logs and other investigative work, &#8220;we have no indication, at this time, that any personal information was misused in any way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 6 million users access Zocdoc a month, the company said.</p>
<p>If this incident sounds vaguely familiar, it&#8217;s because this was a near-identical security issue to one Zocdoc reported in 2016. A <a href="https://www.databreaches.net/patient-appointment-booking-service-notifying-patients-of-potential-breach/">letter filed at the time</a> cited similar &#8220;programming errors&#8221; that allowed staff at medical providers to improperly access patient data.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome back to Daily Crunch. It’s Monday, May 24, and all I can think about is how much I want a Surface Duo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/microsofts-surface-duo-gets-dual-screen-gaming-support/">now that it can do two-screen gaming</a>. And one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/apple-24-inch-m1-imac-review/">those new iMacs</a>. I don’t need either, of course, but that doesn’t stop my coveting both of the gadgets. Alas.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was a super busy start to the week, with lots of startup funding rounds, more in the long-running saga of governments trying to control social media platforms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-globals-ipo-filing-uncovers-modest-growth-strong-adjusted-profitability/">even more IPO news</a> and the latest troubles with Tesla. Let’s cut the chatter and dive in. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governments vs. Tech: </strong>Indian police tied to the central government showed up at two different Twitter offices today, in what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">appeared to be an intimidation effort</a> following Twitter’s decision to not unlabel a tweet from a member of the current ruling party as manipulated media.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few things here. First, India is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/technology/florida-twitter-facebook-ban-politicians.html"><em>not</em> alone</a> in trying to force social media companies to behave as local governments want them to. That said, what the current Indian government is doing is particularly egregious and doesn’t bode well for the country’s tech ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla owes Norway: </strong>American electric car darling Tesla appears to be in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/tesla-faces-163m-payout-to-drivers-in-norway-following-court-decision/">hot water with Norway</a> after a “Norwegian conciliation council” ordered the company to pay $16,000 each to thousands of Model S owners after “it found that a software update led to longer charging times.” Ouch. Tesla will have to sell lots of American regulatory credits to cover that loss. Norway is a key market for EVs.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. cities buy abuse-linked tech:</strong> From the “you should read this” files, the latest report from our own Zack Whittaker and IPVM states that “at least a hundred U.S. counties, towns and cities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/united-states-towns-hikvision-dahua-surveillance/">have bought Chinese-made surveillance systems that the U.S. government has linked to human rights abuses</a>.” Not good.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>As always we’re picking and choosing the best rounds from the day, so feel free to scrounge around the blog if you need even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/"><strong>Solidus Labs raises $20M for crypto-snooping</strong></a><strong>:</strong> As the value of cryptocurrencies rose in the past year, so too did business at Solidus Labs, which detects “volume and price manipulation” among bitcoin and its brethren. Per its CEO, Asaf Meir, his company saw a “400% increase in inbound demand over 2020.” That sounds about right. Also, Solidus should drop a monthly report on the level of manipulation on every exchange and crypto. That would rule.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/fireflies-ai-raises-14m-for-its-meeting-transcription-and-automation-service/"><strong>Fireflies.ai raises $14M to record, transcribe and connect your meetings</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Former Acceleprise company Fireflies is building software that will record and transcribe your meetings, and then connect the text &#8212; and perhaps the embedded tasks &#8212; to other bits of software. It’s interesting, and growing like a weed. So Khosla helped put $14 million into it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/"><strong>Mono raises $2M to power African fintech</strong></a><strong>:</strong> From building the Plaid for Africa to “power the internet economy in Africa,” Mono is not short on vision. And now it has had its accounts refreshed to pursue its plans to “[streamline] various financial data in a single API for companies and third-party developers.” APIs are cool. Fintech is cool. Fintech APIs are extra cool. That’s our take.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/seed-stage-accelerator-flat6labs-closes-13-2m-fund-for-startups-in-egypt/"><strong>Flat6Labs raises $13.2M to fund Egyptian startups</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This is fund news, but it’s small enough that it fits inside the startup section today. In short, since 2011 Flat6Labs has been an accelerator in Egypt and Tunisia. And now it has a new checkbook to play with.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-globals-ipo-filing-uncovers-modest-growth-strong-adjusted-profitability/"><strong>Inside Zeta Global’s IPO</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Finally from the startup world today, Zeta Global is going public. It’s an offering that could set the tone for the martech world for some time to come. So, we dug into its numbers a bit tardily to figure out just what Zeta has that public investors might want.</p>
<h2>When to walk away from a VC who wants to invest in your startup</h2>
<p>Ofri Ben-Porat flew from London to NYC to meet potential investors, but at the last minute, one canceled, claiming illness. Moments later, he received a DocSend push notification informing him that said VC had just opened the pitch deck he&#8217;d sent days before.</p>
<p>Undeterred, he showed up anyway and pretended he hadn&#8217;t received their email. The discussion went well; after he flew home, the VCs offered pre-terms and due diligence, &#8220;but ultimately, I didn’t feel right taking money from them,&#8221; says Ben-Porat.</p>
<p>Securing the right amount of funding at the right moment can make or break a startup, but founders who can&#8217;t identify red flags — or worse, ignore them — will live to regret it.</p>

<p>What has a zillion hands and likes to copy its friends? Facebook! This time, however, Facebook could be doing something interesting.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors&#8217; cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin&#8217; more than wishes. The automaker reported Monday a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity.</p>
<p>Lowlights include <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/24/2234946/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html">higher-than-expected forecasted expenses</a>, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year — from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised.</p>
<p>The value of the company, which went public via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">SPAC last year</a>, has fallen sharply from its post-combination highs. Today its shares are off another 7% after the close of trading, thanks to its Q1 2021 report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors were not thrilled with the company that 11 months ago showed off a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lordstown-debuts-a-52500-electric-pickup-alongside-a-campaigning-mike-pence/">prototype of Endurance</a>, the all-electric pickup truck that it has bet its future on.</p>
<p>Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of CEO Steve Burns&#8217; other company, Workhorse Group, a battery and electric transportation technology company that is also a publicly traded company. Workhorse is a small company that was founded in 1998 and has struggled financially at various points. Its offshoot, Lordstown Motors, has previously said it planned 20,000 electric trucks annually, starting in the second half of 2021, at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Lordstown Motors acquired in November the 6.2 million-square-foot factory from GM.</p>
<h2>Production woes, capital concerns</h2>
<p>Lordstown reported a $125 million net loss on zero revenue, along with capital expenditures of $53 million in the first quarter. And yet, Lordstown had little to show for its outsized spending.</p>
<p>The company said in a release that it would still begin production of its Endurance electric pickup truck this year but that its output &#8220;would be at best 50% of our prior expectations.&#8221; That fact on top of its massive cash drawdown was hardly investor catnip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research indicates a very robust demand for our vehicles,&#8221; Burns told investors during a call Monday. &#8220;However, capital may limit our ability to make as many vehicles as we would like, and as such, we are constantly evaluating our capital needs and the various types of capital available to us, including strategic capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EV company anticipates ending 2021 with just $50 million to $75 million in liquidity, despite its recent SPAC combination that helped capitalize its operations. Lordstown <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020">finished 2020</a> with $630 million in cash; it wrapped Q1 2021 with $587 million. The company anticipates &#8220;capital expenditures of between $250 [million] and $275 million,&#8221; in addition to its regular cash consumption from operating costs.</p>
<p>Burns said the company was in discussions with an unnamed financial entity for asset-backed financing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have zero debt and we have a lot of assets, and we&#8217;re buying a lot of parts. So there&#8217;s folks that want to finance that,&#8221; he said. Lordstown is also still pursuing an Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Executives said DOE has done several rounds of due diligence but declined to comment on the timing, though Burns said multiple times that Tesla wouldn&#8217;t exist had it not gotten an ATVM loan in January 2010.</p>
<p>For post-combination SPAC companies, Lordstown&#8217;s lackluster results and bearish trading are yet more indication that the boom in using blank-check agreements to take EV and other automotive-focused companies public was perhaps premature.</p>
<p>Lordstown announced its SPAC merger in September 2020 with a market value of $1.6 billion. Its shares soared to $31.80 apiece at their 52-week highs. Today they are worth $8.77.</p>
<p>Burns lauded the company&#8217;s purported competitive advantages, including its hub motor architecture and physical simplicity, which he said would translate into a lower cost of ownership. But the company has stiff competition from new EV entrants Rivian and Tesla (should the Cybertruck ever hit production) and legacy automakers like Ford, which debuted the electric model of its nameplate F-150 truck model earlier this month with a price point under $40,000.</p>
<p>But Burns reiterated his feeling that the company was on par with its competitors and that it wants to be &#8220;ready to pounce&#8221; in response to vehicle demand. The CEO also said he was confident that the truck would hit the 250-mile target range, though this is less than both the Rivian R1T and the Ford F-150 Lightning.</p>
<p>Lordstown also gave a brief update on preorders following its announcement in January that it hit a milestone of 100,000 preorders. Burns said around 30,000 of those had been converted to what it&#8217;s calling &#8220;vehicle purchase agreements,&#8221; but he demurred on exactly how many of those customers have paid anything, saying only that &#8220;many of those&#8221; agreements, included some kind of down payment.</p>
<p>The company also began work on its second vehicle, an electric van, with a prototype anticipated later this summer.</p>
<h2>Financial results</h2>
<p>Turning to Lordstown&#8217;s first quarter performance, we&#8217;re observing a pre-revenue company in the weeds of testing and scaling production for an incredibly complex product. Which is an expensive endeavor.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156807" style="width: 1788px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156807" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2156807 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png" alt="Lordstown Q1 2021 " width="1778" height="723" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png 1778w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=768,312 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=680,277 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=1536,625 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-24-at-2.46.58-PM.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1778px) 100vw, 1778px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156807" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lordstown</p></div></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s greater-than-before sales and administrative costs are whatever compared to its spiraling research and development spend. For investors holding onto Lordstown shares in hopes of its eventual early construction runs leading to mass production that is now further in the future, it&#8217;s a tough income statement to digest.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021 the company spent around $91,000 in research and development expenses. &#8220;The higher than expected R&amp;D spend is largely from higher part costs from a supply chain that remains under duress, from collocations, and which impacted our beta costs, higher costs of shipping included expedited shipping and greater use of temporary external engineering,&#8221; Lordstown CFO Julio Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Company executives also briefly addressed accusations by short seller Hindenburg Research, who claimed the automaker was faking preorders of its vehicles. Hindenburg said that &#8220;extensive research reveals that the company&#8217;s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burns told investors that the company established a special independent committee to investigate the allegations in the report. This is in addition to a separate investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the company is cooperating with, he said.</p>
<p>In the wake of Lordstown&#8217;s results, however, shares of Tesla and Nikola were largely flat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/23/british-ai-startup-faculty-raises-42-5m-growth-round-led-by-apax-digital-fund/">of the news</a> that U.K.-based AI startup Faculty has raised $42.5 million in a growth funding round, I teased out more from CEO and co-founder Marc Warner on what his plans are for the company.</p>
<p>Faculty seems to have an uncanny knack of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/vote-leave-ai-firm-wins-seven-government-contracts-in-18-months">winning</a> U.K. government contracts, after helping Boris Johnson win his Vote Leave campaign and thus become prime minister. It&#8217;s even helping sort out the mess that Brexit has <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/faculty-ai-brexit-fishing">subsequently</a> made of the fishing industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/ai-startup-faculty-wins-contract-to-predict-future-requirements-for-the-uks-nhs/">problems with the NHS</a> and telling global corporates like Red Bull and Virgin Media what to suggest to their customers. Meanwhile, it continues to hoover up PhD graduates at a rate of knots to work on its AI platform.</p>
<p>But, speaking to me over a call, Warner said the company no longer has plans to enter the political sphere again: “Never again. It&#8217;s very controversial. I don&#8217;t want to make out that I think politics is unethical. Trying to make the world better, in whatever dimension you can, is a good thing … But from our perspective, it was, you know, ‘noisy,’ and our goal as an organization, despite current appearances to the contrary, is not to spend tonnes of time talking about this stuff. We do believe this is an important technology that should be out there and should be in a broader set of hands than just the tech giants, who are already very good at it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the investment, he said: &#8220;Fundamentally, the money is about doubling down on the U.K. first and then international expansion. Over the last seven years or so we have learned what it takes to do important AI, impactful AI, at scale. And we just don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s actually much of it out there. Customers are rightly sometimes a bit skeptical, as there&#8217;s been hype around this stuff for years and years. We figured out a bunch of the real-world applications that go into making this work so that it actually delivers the value. And so, ultimately, the money is really just about being able to build out all of the pieces to do that incredibly well for our customers.”</p>

<p>He said Faculty would be staying firmly HQ’d in the U.K. to take advantage of the U.K.&#8217;s talent pool: &#8220;The U.K. is a wonderful place to do AI. It’s got brilliant universities, a very dynamic startup scene. It&#8217;s actually more diverse than San Francisco. There’s government, there&#8217;s finance, there are corporates, there&#8217;s less competition from the tech giants. There&#8217;s a bit more of a heterogeneous ecosystem. There&#8217;s no sense in which we&#8217;re thinking, &#8216;Right, that&#8217;s it, we&#8217;re up and out!&#8217;. We love working here, we want to make things better. We’ve put an enormous amount of effort into trying to help organizations like the government and the NHS, but also a bunch of U.K. corporates in trying to embrace this technology, so that&#8217;s still going to be a terrifically important part of our business.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, Faculty plans to expand abroad: “We&#8217;re going to start looking further afield as well, and take all of the lessons we&#8217;ve learned to the U.S., and then later Europe.”</p>
<p>But does he think this funding round will help it get ahead of other potential rivals in the space? “We tend not to think too much in terms of rivals,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The next 20 years are going to be about building intelligence into the software that already exists. If you look at the global market cap of the software businesses out there, that&#8217;s enormous. If you start adding intelligence to that, the scale of the market is so large that it&#8217;s much more important to us that we can take this incredibly important technology and deploy it safely in ways that actually improve people&#8217;s lives. It could be making products cheaper or helping organizations make their services more efficient.”</p>
<p>If that’s the case, then does Faculty have any kind of ethics panel overseeing its work? &#8220;We have an internal ethics panel. We have a set of principles and if we think a project might violate those principles, it gets referred to that ethics panel. It&#8217;s randomly selected from across faculty. So we&#8217;re quite careful about the projects that we work on and don&#8217;t. But to be honest, the vast majority of stuff that&#8217;s going on is very vanilla. They are just clearly &#8216;good for the world&#8217; projects. The vast majority of our work is doing good work for corporate clients to help them make their businesses that bit more efficient.”</p>
<p>I pressed him to expand on this issue of ethics and the potential for bias. He says Faculty &#8220;builds safety in from the start. Oddly enough, the reason I first got interested in AI was reading Nick Bostrom&#8217;s work about <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111">superintelligence </a>and the importance of AI safety. And so from the very, very first fellowship [Faculty AI researchers are called Fellows] all the way back in 2014, we&#8217;ve taught the fellows about AI safety. Over time, as soon as we were able, we started contributing to the research field. So, we&#8217;ve published papers in all of the biggest computer science conferences Neurips, ICM, ICLR, on the topic of AI safety. How to make algorithms fair, private, robust and explainable. So these are a set of problems that we care a great deal about. And, I think, are generally &#8216;underdone&#8217; in the wider ecosystem. Ultimately, there shouldn&#8217;t be a separation between performance and safety. There is a bit of a tendency in other companies to say, ‘Well, you can either have performance, or you can have safety.&#8217; But of course, we know that&#8217;s not true. The cars today are faster and safer than the Model T Ford. So it&#8217;s a sort of a false dichotomy. We’ve invested a bunch of effort in both those capabilities, so we obviously want to be able to create a wonderful performance for the task at hand, but also to ensure that the algorithms are fair, private, robust and explainable wherever required.&#8221;</p>
<p>That also means, he says, that AI might not always be the &#8220;bogeyman&#8221; the phrase implies: &#8220;In some cases, it’s probably not a huge deal if you&#8217;re deciding whether to put a red jumper or a blue jumper at the top of your website. There are probably not huge ethical implications in that. But in other circumstances, of course, it&#8217;s critically important that the algorithms are safe and are known to be safe and are trusted by both the users and anyone else who encounters them. In a medical context, obviously, they need to be trusted by the doctors and the patients need to make sure they actually work. So we&#8217;re really at the forefront of deploying that stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year the Guardian reported that Faculty had won seven government contracts in 18 months. To what does he attribute this success? &#8220;Well, I mean, we lost an enormous number more! We are a tiny supplier to government. We do our best to do work that is valuable to them. We’ve worked for many, many years with people at the home office,&#8221; he tells me.</p>

<p>“Without wanting to go into too much detail, that 18 months stretches over multiple prime ministers. I was appointed to the AI Council under Theresa May. Any sort of insinuations on this are just obviously nonsense. But, at least historically, most of our work was in the private sector and that continues to be critically important for us as an organization. Over the last year, we&#8217;ve tried to step up and do our bit wherever we could for the public sector. It’s facing such a big, difficult situation around COVID, and we&#8217;re very proud of the things we&#8217;ve managed to accomplish with the NHS and the impact that we had on the decisions that senior people were able to undertake.”</p>
<p>Returning to the issue of politics I asked him if he thought &#8212; in the wake of events such as Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, which were both affected by AI-driven political campaigning &#8212; AI is too dangerous to be applied to that arena? He laughed: “It’s a funny old funny question… It’s a really odd way to phrase a question. AI is just a technology. Fundamentally, AI is just maths.”</p>
<p>I asked him if he thought the application of AI in politics had had an outsized or undue influence on the way that political parties have operated in the last few years: &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that is beyond my knowledge,” he says. But does Faculty have regrets about working in the political sphere?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we’re just focused on our work. It’s not that we have strong feelings, either way, it&#8217;s just that from our perspective, it&#8217;s much, much more interesting to be able to do the things that we care about, which is deploying AI in the real world. It&#8217;s a bit of a boring answer! But it is truly how we feel. It’s much more about doing the things we think are important, rather than judging what everyone else is doing.”</p>

<p>Lastly, we touched on the data science capabilities of the U.K. and what the new fundraising will allow the company to do.</p>
<p>He said: “We started an education program. We have roughly 10% of the U.K.&#8217;s PhDs in physics, maths, engineering, applying to the program. Roughly 400 or so people have been through that program and we plan to expand that further so that more and more people get the opportunity to start a career in data science. And then inside Faculty specifically, we think we&#8217;ll be able to create 400 new jobs in areas like software engineering, data science, product management. These are very exciting new possibilities for people to really become part of the technology revolution. I think there&#8217;s going to be a wonderful new energy in Faculty, and hopefully a positive small part in increasing the U.K. tech ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Warner comes across as sincere in his thoughts about the future of AI and is clearly enthusiastic about where Faculty can take the whole field next, both philosophically and practically. Will Faculty soon be challenging that other AI leviathan, DeepMind, for access to all those PhDs? There&#8217;s no doubt it will.</p>

		As co-CEO, Thomas Asseo oversees the strategic direction of <a href="https://www.freshnlean.com/about-us/">Fresh n' Lean</a> in distributing thousands of meals for active lifestyle consumers. Before joining the company, he rose to the top of the auto racing ladder system.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Netflix has two CEOs: Co-founder Reed Hastings oversees the streaming side of the company, while Ted Sarandos guides Netflix’s content.</p>
<p>Warby Parker has co-CEOs as well — its co-founders went to college together. Other companies like the tech giant Oracle and luggage maker Away have shifted from having co-CEOs in recent years, sparking a wave of headlines suggesting that the model is broken.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s impossible to be in two places at once or clone yourself. With co-CEOs, you can effectively do just that.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While there isn’t a lot of research on companies with multiple CEOs, the data is more promising than the headlines would suggest. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6288.2011.00305.x">study</a> on public companies with co-CEOs revealed that the average tenure for co-CEOs, about 4.5 years, was comparable to solitary CEOs, &#8220;suggesting that this arrangement is more stable than previously believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study’s authors also found that co-CEOs were spread across industry types and that splitting the role can &#8220;complement each other in terms of educational background or executive responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>I serve as co-CEO of an organic meal delivery company with my sister Laureen. Having two CEOs has helped us take Fresh n&#8217; Lean to new heights. We closed 2020 with $87 million in revenue, more than double from the year before, and project similar growth this year.</p>
<p>We complement each other well, and the results bear that out. During the decade that we’ve served as co-CEOs, the company has grown from a very small team to 475 full-time employees and 40 part-time employees. We’ve delivered more than 17 million meals, launched four different meal lines, expanded our retail offerings, partnered with some great names in sports and fitness, and saw our annual revenues climb exponentially.</p>
<p>The leadership structure isn’t for every company, but it’s been a great fit for Fresh n&#8217; Lean. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>Divide and conquer to shorten your learning curve by 50%</h2>
<p>Laureen launched the company in 2010 out of her one-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>“Those early years were especially tough,” she said. “I consistently worked 20-hour days as I performed just about every role — cooking dishes, preparing labels, making deliveries and performing customer service duties. I was devoting so much energy into product, packaging and logistics, but in order for the company to grow, I needed help with marketing, tech and finance.”</p>
<p>Those areas happened to be my strengths. There was too much for one person to oversee as CEO and not enough hours in the day. But given the equal challenges that both sides of the company presented and the trust we shared, it made sense for us to be side by side on the organizational chart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a month ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/">researchers revealed</a> a notorious malware family was exploiting a never-before-seen vulnerability that let it bypass macOS security defenses and run unimpeded. Now, some of the same researchers say another malware can sneak onto macOS systems, thanks to another vulnerability.</p>
<p>Jamf says it found evidence that the XCSSET malware was exploiting a vulnerability that allowed it access to parts of macOS that require permission — such as accessing the microphone, webcam or recording the screen — without ever getting consent.</p>
<p>XCSSET was <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/h/xcsset-mac-malware--infects-xcode-projects--uses-0-days.html">first discovered</a> by Trend Micro in 2020 targeting Apple developers, specifically their Xcode projects that they use to code and build apps. By infecting those app development projects, developers unwittingly distribute the malware to their users, in what Trend Micro researchers described as a &#8220;supply-chain-like attack.&#8221; The malware is under continued development, with more recent variants also targeting Macs running <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/d/xcsset-quickly-adapts-to-macos-11-and-m1-based-macs.html">the newer M1 chip</a>.</p>
<p>Once the malware is running on a victim&#8217;s computer, it uses two zero-days — one to steal cookies from the Safari browser to get access to a victim&#8217;s online accounts, and another to quietly install a development version of Safari, allowing the attackers to modify and snoop on virtually any website.</p>
<p>But Jamf says the malware was exploiting a previously undiscovered third zero-day in order to secretly take screenshots of the victim&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>macOS is supposed to ask the user for permission before it allows any app — malicious or otherwise — to record the screen, access the microphone or webcam, or open the user&#8217;s storage. But the malware bypassed that permissions prompt by sneaking in under the radar by injecting malicious code into legitimate apps.</p>
<p>Jamf researchers Jaron Bradley, Ferdous Saljooki, and Stuart Ashenbrenner explained in <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/">a blog post</a>, shared with TechCrunch, that the malware searches for other apps on the victim&#8217;s computer that are frequently granted screen-sharing permissions, like Zoom, WhatsApp and Slack, and injects malicious screen recording code into those apps. This allows the malicious code to &#8220;piggyback&#8221; the legitimate app and inherit its permissions across macOS. Then, the malware signs the new app bundle with a new certificate to avoid getting flagged <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/">by macOS&#8217; built-in security defenses</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers said that the malware used the permissions prompt bypass &#8220;specifically for the purpose of taking screenshots of the user&#8217;s desktop,&#8221; but warned that it was not limited to screen recording. In other words, the bug could have been used to access the victim&#8217;s microphone, webcam or capture their keystrokes, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how many Macs the malware was able to infect using this technique. But Apple confirmed to TechCrunch that it fixed the bug in macOS 11.4, which was made available as an update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That’s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/deep-science/">This column</a> aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This edition, we have a lot of items concerned with the interface between AI or robotics and the real world. Of course most applications of this type of technology have real-world applications, but specifically this research is about the inevitable difficulties that occur due to limitations on either side of the real-virtual divide.</p>
<p>One issue that constantly comes up in robotics is how slow things actually go in the real world. Naturally some robots trained on certain tasks can do them with superhuman speed and agility, but for most that&#8217;s not the case. They need to check their observations against their virtual model of the world so frequently that tasks like picking up an item and putting it down can take minutes.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s especially frustrating about this is that the real world is the best place to train robots, since ultimately they&#8217;ll be operating in it. One approach to addressing this is by increasing the value of every hour of real-world testing you do, which is the goal of <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/04/multi-task-robotic-reinforcement.html">this project over at Google.</a></p>
<p>In a rather technical blog post the team describes the challenge of using and integrating data from multiple robots learning and performing multiple tasks. It&#8217;s complicated, but they talk about creating a unified process for assigning and evaluating tasks, and adjusting future assignments and evaluations based on that. More intuitively, they create a process by which success at task A improves the robots&#8217; ability to do task B, even if they&#8217;re different.</p>
<p>Humans do it — knowing how to throw a ball well gives you a head start on throwing a dart, for instance. Making the most of valuable real-world training is important, and this shows there&#8217;s lots more optimization to do there.</p>
<p>Another approach is to improve the quality of simulations so they&#8217;re closer to what a robot will encounter when it takes its knowledge to the real world. That&#8217;s the goal of the Allen Institute for AI&#8217;s THOR training environment and its newest denizen, ManipulaTHOR.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156602" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manipulathor.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156602" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2156602 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/manipulathor.gif" alt="Animated image of a robot navigating a virtual environment and moving items around." width="857" height="604" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Allen Institute</p></div></p>
<p>Simulators like THOR provide an analogue to the real world where an AI can learn basic knowledge like how to navigate a room to find a specific object — a surprisingly difficult task! Simulators balance the need for realism with the computational cost of providing it, and the result is a system where a robot agent can spend thousands of virtual &#8220;hours&#8221; trying things over and over with no need to plug them in, oil their joints and so on.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last year, Instagram has added a slew of features to help independent creators make a living, like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram Shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping in Reels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-instagram-reels-and-live-insights-tools/">Instagram launched new Insights</a> for Reels and Live on its Professional Dashboard, giving businesses and creators essential data about the reach of their content. These tools will help Reels catch up with its competitor TikTok, which already offers users detailed analytics. As Instagram and TikTok continue trying to keep up with one another, it can only be a good thing for influencers and small businesses that use these platforms to bolster their income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, Instagram creators could only view publicly available metrics, like the views, likes or comments on a Reel. Now, they will be able to access data like Accounts Reached, Saves and Shares for their Reels. Instagram will also share the number of Peak Concurrent Viewers that tune in to watch their Live videos. Plus, in the Account Insights section of the app, Instagram will add breakdowns that show users what kinds of accounts they are reaching, and which content formats are generating their strongest engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For entrepreneurs and content creators whose businesses run on social commerce, these analytics might not change the game, but they certainly make it easier to play. Shopping in Reels makes in-app sales more convenient, but until now, scant data was available to help businesses tailor their Reels to reach potential customers. On the other hand, TikTok’s analytics have long provided creators with data on their videos’ average watch time, types of traffic sources and performance by geographic location. The viral video app announced </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would work with specific brands, like the streetwear label Hype, to test in-app sales. This would deepen its competition with Instagram, but it’s still unclear when the feature will be widely available. So, Instagram’s Insights, combined with established in-app shopping, can create a perfect storm for content creators to better reach and monetize their target audiences.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always thought it was weird that there were no Insights for Reels. Sometimes it feels like shooting in the dark,” Quinn Jones told TechCrunch. Jones is one of the owners of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shop.kikay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KIKAY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a handmade jewelry business based in Los Angeles. With more than 90,000 followers across Instagram and TikTok, the Gen Z creators rely on social media to expand their audience and increase their sales. Though KIKAY has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shop.kikay/video/6954415811838708997?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gone viral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on TikTok, Jones said that Instagram has been the best way for the small business to gain followers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Insights are definitely going to be useful going forward,” said Jones. “It’s currently hard to tell the actual effective reach your videos have, and seeing Insights means more feedback to help improve content.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For influencers, these analytics are also helpful for collaborating with brands on sponsored content. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been wanting Insights for Reels for the longest time. All we know now is views, likes and comments,” said </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/caras_atl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cara Cochran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an LGBTQ+ content creator and microinfluencer. She notes that brands have already been pushing creators to make videos on Reels ever since </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram redesigned its interface</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to place the short videos front-and-center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that they are rolling out analytics, I think we will see a lot of brands push for more and more Reels instead of just static posts,” she says. “I think it brings their products to life in a whole new way, and it almost works like a commercial for them instead of just a static ad.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram will begin rolling out Insights today. The company also says that over the coming months, it will add tools to help creators measure engagement over a preset time frame and begin to support Insights on desktop. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How’s your Monday going? If you’re Apple, the answer is probably somewhere between “very busy” to “gaaaaaaah.” The company just dropped a whole bunch of new OS updates today, including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, all ahead of the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off (virtually) on June 7.</p>
<p>Indeed, iOS and iPadOS are the headliners here &#8212; if for no other reason than the fact that they’ll impact the most devices. The public release of iOS/iPadOS 14.6 brings a couple of biggish features, including the addition of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/"> paid podcast subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">Apple Card Family</a>, both announced at a recent hardware event.</p>
<p>The former allows podcasters to charge for subscriptions to their show (imagine that!), with Apple taking a 30% commission for the first year. That will halve in a year. The latter, meanwhile, makes it possible for Apple Card owners to effectively split a card, with the various responsibilities that entails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Tim Cook noted at the time of announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the things that became apparent to us in the beginning [of launching Apple Card] was a lack of fairness in the way the industry calculated credit scores when there were two holders of a credit card. One of you got the benefit of building a good credit history, and the other did not. We want to reinvent the way this works.</p></blockquote>
<p>MacOS 11.4 brings support for additional graphics cards, a number of bug fixes and, like the new iOS, support for paid podcast subs. Ditto that last part and Apple Card Family for the new watchOS 7.5, along with support for additional health features in Malaysia and Peru, as well as expense tracking for the Apple Card. TVOS/HomePod 14.6, meanwhile, are getting bug fixes and some color balance changes for the former.</p>
<p>Along with all of this, the company also announced the slate of programming for this year’s virtual WWDC. Things will kick off on June 7 at 10 a.m. PT with the keynote. That’s where the big news on the latest version of all of the above will be announced &#8212; and, hopefully, some hardware, as well. At 2 p.m. the company will be offering more information with its annual Platforms State of the Union.</p>
<p>The full schedule is available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soliduslabs.com/">Solidus Labs</a>, a company that says its surveillance and risk-monitoring software can detect manipulation across cryptocurrency trading platforms, is today announcing $20 million in Series A funding led by Evolution Equity Partners, with participation from Hanaco Ventures, Avon Ventures, 645 Ventures, the cryptocurrencies derivative exchange FTX,  and also a sprinkling of government officials, including former CFTC commissioner Chris Giancarlo and former SEC commissioner Troy Paredes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty great timing, given the various signals coming from the U.S. government just last week that it&#8217;s intent on improving its crypto monitoring efforts &#8212; such as the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s call for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/us-treasury-calls-for-stricter-cryptocurrency-compliance-with-irs.html">stricter cryptocurrency compliance</a> with the IRS.</p>
<p>Of course, Solidus didn&#8217;t spring into existence last week. Rather, Solidus was founded in 2017 by several former Goldman Sachs employees who worked on the firm&#8217;s electronic trading desk for equities. At the time, Bitcoin was only becoming buzzier, but while the engineers anticipated different use cases for the cryptocurrency, they also recognized that a lack of compliance tools would be a barrier to its adoption by bigger financial institutions, so they left to build these.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast-forward and today Solidus employs 30 people, has raised $23.75 million and is in the process of doubling its head count to address growing demand. We talked with Solidus&#8217;s New York-based co-founder and CEO Asaf Meir &#8212; who was himself one of those former Goldman engineers &#8212; about the company late last week. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are your customers?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We work with exchanges, broker dealers, OTC desks, liquidity providers and regulators &#8212; anyone who is exposed to the risk of buying and selling cryptocurrencies, crypto assets or digital assets, whatever you want to call them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you promising to uncover for them?</strong></p>
<p>AM: What we detect, largely speaking, is volume and price manipulation, and that has to do with wash trading, spoofing, layering, pump and dumps and an additional growing library of crypto-native alerts that truly only exist in our unique market.</p>
<p>We had a 400% increase in inbound demand over 2020 driven largely by two factors, I think. One is regulatory scrutiny. Globally, regulators have gone off to market participants, letting them know that they have to ask for permission, not forgiveness. The second reason &#8212; which I like better &#8212; is the drastic institutional increase in appetite toward exposure for this asset class. Every institution, the first question they ask any executing platform is: &#8216;What are your risk mitigation tools? How do you make sure there is market integrity?&#8217;</p>

<p><strong> TC: We talked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/nft_users/">couple of months</a> ago, and you mentioned having a growing pipeline of customers, like the trading platform <a href="https://bittrex.com/">Bittrex</a> in Seattle. Is demand coming primarily from the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We have demand in Asia and in Europe, as well, so we will be opening offices there, too.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is your former employer Goldman a customer?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I can&#8217;t comment on that, but I would say there isn&#8217;t a bank right now that isn&#8217;t thinking about how they&#8217;re going to get exposure to crypto assets, and in order to do that in a safe, compliant and robust way, they have to employ crypto-specific solutions.</p>
<p>Right now, there&#8217;s the new frontier &#8212; the clients we&#8217;re currently working with, which are these crypto-pure exchanges, broker dealers, liquidity providers and even traditional financial institutions that are coming into crypto and opening a crypto operation or a crypto desk. Then there&#8217;s the new <em>new</em> frontier; your NFTs, stablecoins, indexes, lending platforms, decentralized protocols and God knows what [else] all of a sudden reaching out to us, telling us they want to do the right thing, to ensure the users on their platform are well-protected, and that trading activities are audited, and [to enlist us] to prevent any manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does your subscription service work and who is building the tech?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We consume private data from our clients &#8212; all their training data &#8212; and we then put it in our detection models, which we ultimately surface through insights and alerts on our dashboard, which they have access to.</p>
<p>As for who is building it, we have a lot of fintech engineers who are coming from Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Citi and bringing that traditional knowledge of large trading systems at scale; we also have incredible data scientists out of Israel whose expertise is in anomaly detection, which they are applying to financial crime, working with us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do these crimes look like?</strong></p>
<p>AM: When we started out, there was much more wholesale manipulation happening whether through wash trading or pump and dumps &#8212; things that are more easy to perform. What we&#8217;re seeing today are extremely sophisticated manipulation schemes where bad actors are able to exploit different executing platforms. We&#8217;re quite literally surfacing new alerts that if you were to use a legacy, rule-based system you wouldn&#8217;t be able to [surface] because you&#8217;re not really sure what you&#8217;re looking for. We oftentimes have an alert that we haven&#8217;t named yet; we just know that this type of behavior is considered manipulative in nature and that our client should be looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate a bit more about these new anomalies?</strong></p>
<p>AM: I&#8217;m conflicted about how much can we share of our clients&#8217; private data. But one thing we&#8217;re seeing is [a surge in] account extraction attacks, which is when through different ways, bad actors are able to gain access to an account&#8217;s funds and are able in a sophisticated way to trade out of the exchange or broker dealer or custodian. That&#8217;s happening in different social engineering-related ways, but we&#8217;re able, through account deviation and account profiling, to alert the exchange or broker dealer or financial institution we&#8217;re working with to avoid that.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>We&#8217;re about detection and prevention, not about tracing [what went wrong and where] after the fact. And we can do that regardless of knowing even personal identifiable information about that account. It&#8217;s not about the name or the IP address; it&#8217;s all about the attributes of trading. In fact, if we have an exchange in Hong Kong that&#8217;s experiencing a pump and dump on a certain coin pair, we can preemptively warn the rest of our client base so they can take steps to prepare and protect themselves.</p>
<p><strong>TC: On the prevention front, could you also stop that activity on the Hong Kong exchange? Are you empowered by your clients to step in if you detect something anomalous?</strong></p>
<p>AM: We&#8217;re bomb-sniffing dogs, so we&#8217;re not coming to disable the bot. We know how to take the data and point out manipulation, but it&#8217;s then up to the financial institution to handle the case.</p>

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists add value in a number of ways. For example, one of my business’ backers has a deep tech &#8220;pod&#8221; that generates events and content we are always welcomed to be a part of. Another one of our investors gives us full commercial support through its network of mentors that are there to support the business, not the VC.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Due diligence works both ways, and entrepreneurs shouldn’t be in a rush to take investment from anyone that offers it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I might not expect that from every VC, but if they promise those &#8220;assets&#8221; by saying that they are here to drive innovation and growth, then I expect them to deliver, just as I have to back up the claim of having a team of supersmart machine learning researchers.</p>
<p>They might know the forks in the road, directions to take, and who to speak to based on having been through the process with similar companies. They might have venture partners that can mentor you and a network of investors that can participate in follow-on rounds. That is where they add value.</p>
<p>The best ones will seek to connect with you personally. They’ll have prepared thoroughly beforehand and are brimming with questions. While they may have preconceived and potentially ill-informed ideas, they demonstrate enthusiasm by starting sentences with &#8220;what if,&#8221; and they leave me emboldened but contemplative. I fully expect to be provoked in the right way.</p>
<p>However, some also play God. One experience offered up a major warning sign, one that would make me walk on by.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to say my business has some outstanding investors who totally get it. Our investors&#8217; head of investment told representatives at one of New York&#8217;s top funds that one of their leading deep tech portfolio companies was coming to town for a &#8220;blitz meeting session.&#8221; They announced that they were committing to the round I was raising and that we were looking for a new lead investor.</p>
<p>So, put it this way: I wasn’t a guy who walked off the street with a crazy idea, but you might have thought otherwise, given the experience that followed. To be clear, I don’t expect all VCs to open their arms and embrace everyone, but there are rules of engagement.</p>
<h2>The transparency and value of DocSend</h2>
<p>After a very positive morning meeting, I’d scheduled a couple of hours for a quick chance to grab a breather at my hotel. Flicking through my phone, an email from the associate at the VC I was due to meet next pinged into my inbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Ofri, it’s Jessica [not her real name], really sorry, I’m not feeling great so am thinking I might cut the day short. I know you’re only in New York the next two days, so let’s catch up later on a call and next time you’re over I’m sure we can revisit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started composing a polite response: &#8220;Really sorry to hear that. Absolutely fine to reschedule. Let me know your availability, etc., etc.&#8221; In truth, I was irritated &#8212; this had been in the diary for two months and was one of six meetings scheduled. I was not sorry; I was annoyed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft have officially started to offer free rides to anyone traveling to get a COVID-19 vaccine, two weeks after the ride-hailing companies announced an agreement with the White House to offer the program.</p>
<p>The free rides will last through July 4, the date when President Joe Biden wants 70% of U.S. adults to be vaccinated. Lyft and Uber have previously told TechCrunch the companies will cover the costs of the rides. The White House advised on the development and launch of the product. The White House also shared data on the more than 80,000 vaccination sites in the country, an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Uber is giving riders four one-way rides up to $25 off each. Each of these two round trips must be three weeks apart between Monday and July 4, Uber said in a blog post. Riders can access the program by opening the Uber app and tapping &#8220;vaccine&#8221; and then &#8220;get your free ride.&#8221; The free rides are offered between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. Riders must enter the ZIP code of their appointment to find the location they are going to or coming from. The rider then selects the provider location and the ride option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156597" style="width: 157px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lyft-Vaccine-Rides-Gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156597" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2156597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lyft-Vaccine-Rides-Gif.gif?w=147" alt="Lyft Vaccine Rides Gif" width="147" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156597" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lyft</p></div></p>
<p>Lyft is offering two roundtrip rides up to $15 each trip. Lyft said if either ride costs more than $15 or if the rider tips their driver, those additional charges will hit their personal form of payment. Lyft is also requiring these free rides be three weeks apart.</p>
<p>The vaccine access program follows efforts by both companies to provide free and discounted rides to underserved communities as well as roll out features to make it easier to access vaccine information and point-of-distribution sites. Uber first rolled out a COVID-relief program in March to offer free rides and deliveries. In December, the company said it would give an additional 10 million free or discounted rides.</p>
<p>Uber announced in April that it was launching more than a half-dozen new features, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab.</p>
<p>Lyft kicked off in December a universal vaccine access campaign, a coalition of partners that includes JPMorgan Chase, Anthem and United Way, to provide 60 million rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, uninsured and at-risk communities.</p>

If you want to place your ground-breaking, edge-cutting, envelope-pushing (no extra charge for clichés) early-stage startup in front of the world’s leading mobility movers, shakers and makers you gotta hustle. You have just one week left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2022&amp;utm_content=sua&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sua&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy one of our remaining three Startup Exhibitor Packages.</a></p>
<p>Here’s what the $380 package includes, plus a few suggestions on ways to take full advantage of the virtual platform’s capabilities and boost the opportunity factor. <strong>Note:</strong> Exhibitors must be pre-Series A, early-stage startups in the mobility field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual booth space</li>
<li>Lead generation</li>
<li>4 conference passes</li>
<li>Full event access</li>
<li>Videos on-demand</li>
<li>Breakout sessions</li>
<li>Networking with CrunchMatch</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopin, our virtual platform, lets you tap into your creativity. Include a product walk-through video — complete with links to your website and social media accounts — at your virtual booth. But get this. Your booth also includes live stream capability. Make the most of that opportunity. Share your screen, host a live demo or a product tutorial and moderate the chat area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maybe you’d like to host and live stream your own Q&amp;A session. Go for it. Or why not establish yourself as a subject matter expert? Choose your topic and combine your virtual booth and CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, to send invitations to the people you want to impress and get the conversation started. And of course, you can always schedule 1:1 video calls.</p>
<p>Since you’ll have four event passes, you and your team can tend to booth business and take in a range of presentations. Here are just two examples of what’s in store. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?promo=leftrail#878941bf-c22c-4ec4-ab2f-d8c0c15cb8ae">the event agenda</a> and plan your schedule now.</p>
<p><strong>Supercharging Self-Driving Super Vision:</strong> Few startups were as prescient as Scale AI when it came to anticipating the need for massive sets of tagged data for use in AI. Co-founder and CEO Alex Wang also made a great bet on addressing the needs of lidar sensing companies early on, which has made the company instrumental in deploying AV networks. We’ll hear about what it takes to make sense of sensor data in driverless cars and look at where the industry is headed.</p>
<p><strong>AVs: Past, Present and Future:</strong> TechCrunch Mobility will talk to two pioneers, and competitors, who are leading the charge to commercialize autonomous vehicles. Karl Iagnemma, president of the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, and Chris Urmson, the co-founder and CEO of Aurora, will discuss — and maybe even debate — the best approach to AV development and deployment, swap stories of the earliest days of the industry and provide a few forecasts of what’s to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=eventannouncement&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> takes place on June 9, but you have just one week left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2022&amp;utm_content=sua&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=sua&amp;display=true">reserve your virtual demo booth</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.futurefamily.com">Future Family</a>, a company we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/future-family/">a few times over the years</a>, makes fertility treatments more accessible. They pre-negotiate terms with fertility clinics to ensure there are no surprise fees, convert the often substantial upfront costs into a monthly payment plan and give each user a dedicated Fertility Coach to help them navigate their journey.</p>
<p>This morning the company is announcing that it has raised a $9 million round of funding as it expands the network of clinics it works with.</p>
<p>The company last raised $10 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/future-family-raises-10m-to-make-fertility-treatments-more-affordable/">in a Series A back in 2018</a>, and they&#8217;re positioning this round as an extension of that — a &#8220;Series A-1&#8221;, as they&#8217;re calling it — rather than a whole new round.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/18/future-family-raises-10m-to-make-fertility-treatments-more-affordable/">I&#8217;ve written before</a>, Future Family was inspired by founder Claire Tomkins&#8217; own experiences:</p>
<blockquote><p>Future Family was born out of Claire Tomkins’ own experiences with the complexities and costs of fertility treatments. After spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on treatments involved with having her first child (with much of the cost coming as a surprise only revealed once the process had begun), Claire set out to build a better way. Future Family partners with clinics to work out all the pricing ahead of time and pays the bill upfront, ensuring there are no billing surprises down the road.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Claire Tomkins, Future FamilyClaire tells me that, as it did for just about everyone, 2020 brought a whole new set of challenges for the company. In the early days of the pandemic, as a million questions about COVID-19 emerged, many fertility clinics closed their doors. And even as the clinics began reopening, with little certainty about where things might be in nine months, many patients understandably held off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was definitely a tough year,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but I think we&#8217;re emerging in a good place.&#8221;</p>

<p>2021 is already looking like a different story, Claire tells me. &#8220;People had to sit on the sidelines,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People who have wanted to go forward with treatment, and now have waited 12 or more months&#8230; it&#8217;s gotten very busy.&#8221; According to their numbers, Claire expects the second half of 2021 to hit &#8220;record levels of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help with the sudden spike in demand, the company is adding more fertility clinics to its network, including CCRM — a fertility group with locations in Minneapolis, Houston, Denver, San Francisco and a number of other major metros.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Norwegian conciliation council has ordered Tesla to pay thousands of dollars each to Model S owners after it found that a software update led to longer charging times, the Norwegian newspaper <a href="https://www.nettavisen.no/okonomi/tesla-domt-i-retten-risikerer-milliardutbetaling-til-norske-elbil-eiere/s/12-95-3424130203">Nettavisen</a> reported Monday. Drivers eligible for compensation under the ruling will receive 136,000 kroner ($16,000) each.</p>
<p>Thirty Tesla drivers brought a complaint to the conciliation council in December 2020, citing that charging times slowed down after a software update the previous year. The poorer performance affected Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured between 2013 and 2015.</p>
<p>Tesla sold about 10,000 Model S vehicles during that time frame in Norway. That means Tesla faces an overall payout of up to 1.36 kroner ($163 million), Nettavisen said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla did not respond to the complaint prior to the judgement being issued and it has until May 30 to pay the fine. The company has the opportunity to appeal the ruling to the Oslo Conciliation Board by June 17.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Tesla has faced complaints on charging speeds in court. A Tesla owner in 2019 filed a lawsuit against the EV manufacturer in the Northern California federal court alleging fraud and decreased battery range following a software update.</p>
<p>Norway leads Europe in the number of EVs on the road, with battery electric vehicles accounting for 54% of all new vehicle sales in 2020, according to the Norwegian Road Federation. Audi e-trons were the most popular vehicle sold, followed by the Model 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we head into the summer of vaccination, travel is bound to start bouncing back from the lows of 2020, and Airbnb is betting it will look very different than it did in the pre-COVID era.</p>
<p>The home-sharing platform has introduced some big changes, across a wide variety of feature sets, that focus on flexibility for the guests and simplicity for the hosts. The end goal, according to Airbnb Head of Guest Experience <a href="https://twitter.com/samshank?lang=en">Sam Shank</a>, is to increase both the volume and diversity of the supply side of the operation.</p>
<p>To start, Airbnb has streamlined the process of becoming a host, minimizing the amount of steps it takes to get a listing up. Machine learning algorithms can also now automatically arrange photos based on guest appeal, and hosts are provided suggestions from Airbnb about the best titles and descriptions for their listing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156449" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156449" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2156449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?w=341" alt="" width="300" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png 866w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=768,1533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=341,680 341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=769,1536 769w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/40-Host-welcome-page.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156449" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbnb</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also adding new layers of data to the system, integrating with publicly available real estate data, so that hosts can simply enter their address and have information like number of bedrooms and bathrooms automatically filled in.</p>
<p>Other improvements to the hosting experience include a redesigned &#8220;Welcome to Hosting&#8221; hub, and a new Today tab that helps hosts keep track of new messages, tasks, etc.</p>
<p>On the guests side, Airbnb is doubling down on features around flexibility.</p>
<p>In February, for example, the company introduced flexible date search, letting people search for listings based on the type of trip, rather than the dates. Users can now search for a long weekend, a week-long trip or a month-long trip.</p>
<p>Today, Airbnb announced that it is making its search product even more supple with &#8220;Flexible Matching&#8221; and &#8220;Flexible Destinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flexible Matching essentially adds wiggle room to a more specific search. For example, if a user searches for listings under $250/night, it might show listings that fit all other criteria but are priced slightly outside of that range. Or, if a user searches for a certain set of amenities, it might show a listing that&#8217;s only missing one.</p>
<p>Flexible Destinations allow a user to search for a certain type of listing regardless of the location. Think treehouses or beach-side properties.</p>

<p>Combined, this type of flexible search will expose guests to a much more diverse pool of listings, and the updated hosts flow is expected to increase supply in some of these less explored destinations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brian [Chesky] said we have the right amount of hosts for this summer, but also that we have the capacity to add millions of hosts,&#8221; said Shank, explaining that changing how people find places expands their search to more diverse supply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were boiling down one big theme, it&#8217;s really around helping us get more diverse, unique supply and helping more people become very successful at being hosts, and recognizing the benefits of that,&#8221; said Shank. &#8220;There are financial benefits and also the chance to meet people from around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside flexible search updates and the improved host flow, Airbnb is also making upgrades to its community support department, doubling the number of support agents available on the phone this summer and expanding support coverage from 11 to 42 languages. The company has also redesigned the Help Center, with easier navigation, for both hosts and guests.</p>
<p>All told, this release includes more than 100 updates to the product.</p>
<p>Much of it was informed by Airbnb&#8217;s 2021 trend report, which showed that families both drove and diversified travel through the summer of 2020, with family travel growing from 27% of nights booked to 33% in the summer of 2021 globally. Of family travel, 42% of the nights booked were in rural destinations, which is up 10 percentage points from the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s work to expand its listing supply is not surprising given that it is now a public company, giving it a slightly less-forgiving investor pool to impress on a quarterly basis. Airbnb survived the COVID-19 pandemic better than some expected, thanks in part to users booking long stays while they quarantined. But now Airbnb needs to lead its industry into the post-COVID world if it wants to not only defend its market position, but also the very growth rates that helped it become the well-known brand that it remains today.</p>
<p>Of course, onboarding more hosts with more automated tooling opens the door to quality risks. We&#8217;ll see how users respond to both more supply and more computer-aided supply generation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, we held our first dedicated space startup event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a>, featuring some of the industry&#8217;s top founders and leaders, including <strong>Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, Lockheed Martin&#8217;s Lisa Callahan, Amazon&#8217;s Dave Limp, NASA&#8217;s Kathy Lueders</strong> and many more. This year, we&#8217;re excited to announce we&#8217;re doing it again with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, happening virtually December 14-15.</p>
<p>Even in just the few short months between when we held <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020">TC Sessions: Space</a> in 2020 and now, there&#8217;s been a lot of major activity in the industry, including many launches and the addition of plenty more in-space infrastructure. NASA is signaling more strongly than ever that it wants to encourage the private sector to replace the International Space Station at the end of its useful life, and is working with more startups than ever in its pursuit of ever-greater public-private collaboration.</p>
<p>This year is also set to be one of the busiest yet in terms of new commercial launch companies coming online, with planned debut commercial or test orbital flights from companies including Astra, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace. And with more constellations in operation, built out of satellites equipped with sensors capable of providing new and more detailed data for commercial use back on Earth, the timing is right for startups everywhere to leverage a new data gold rush to build businesses based on in-space resources that just weren&#8217;t available before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll be diving into this much-expanded launch market, and in the many opportunities available in taking the exploding wealth of data from space-based sources and making those readily available for use on Earth, at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021?promo=launchpost&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a> this year. We&#8217;re also looking forward to hearing more about what&#8217;s next in human space exploration, and in securing the stars for the safety and continued access of all.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="http://Fireflies.ai">Fireflies.ai</a> project is a good reminder that not every startup project goes from idea to unicorn-status in 48 minutes. Instead, the startup&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/krish_ramineni?lang=en">Krish Ramineni</a> told TechCrunch about how a period of interest in natural language processing (NLP), tinkering with a friend, a stint at Microsoft, and even working on Slack bots led him to helping found Fireflies.ai (Fireflies), a company that today announced a $14 million raise led by <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla</a>.</p>
<p>Fireflies is a two-part service. Its first point of business is recording and transcribing voice conversations. Things like video meetings, for example. Next, Fireflies wants to plug your voice data into other applications, helping its customers automate data entry, task creation and more.</p>
<p>Before today&#8217;s round, the startup had <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fireflies/company_financials">raised around $5 million</a>, including some micro-rounds, a stint in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">the Acceleprise accelerator</a>, and a $4.9 million seed round raised in late 2019. That investment included participation from Canaan Partners and well-known angel April Underwood.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Fireflies has raised more capital is not surprising, given how quickly it has accreted users. According to an interview with Ramineni, more than 10,000 teams use Fireflies today. In individual usage terms, some 35,000 organizations are represented amongst its user base.</p>
<p>As the company launched its product in early 2020, those results sound pretty good.</p>
<p>But TechCrunch was curious if revenue tracked with usage at Fireflies, as is sometimes the case. It does, Ramineni said, adding that his company grew its revenues 300% in the last six or seven months.</p>
<p>How did it manage such rapid growth while only having raised $5 million before, and with a team that is around 90% in its product and engineering teams? By pursuing everyone&#8217;s favorite: the bottoms-up sales model. In short, you can use Fireflies for free, but if you run out of meeting credits, other usage-based blockers or the need for different, paywalled functionality, you have to cough up for the product.</p>
<p>Folks are, it appears.</p>
<p>Fireflies is in fact an interesting hybrid of SaaS and usage-based pricing. The higher the paid tier that a user selects, the more minutes of transcription they are apportioned per month. But there are caps, limits that users can buy their way out of. TechCrunch asked Ramineni about it, with the CEO explaining that some customers want to ingest years of saved meetings. Our read is that despite work done by the startup to keep its infrastructure costs low, building pricing guardrails around product usage just makes sense for the startup.</p>

<p>The company will sport SaaS-like gross margins, Ramineni confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fireflies wants to plug into more and more meeting platforms, and external software. You can currently link your Fireflies account to services like Zapier, Slack and your CRM. Over time, it&#8217;s not hard to see how the startup could take more direct commands from meetings, and help users better distribute, file and recall meeting information.</p>
<p>As someone with too many meetings, and too many notes documents spread out across the wasteland that is my Google Drive account, I get why people are using Fireflies today. But if the startup can build a no-code automation platform on top of my note taking? Then I will probably have to buy its service.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as a final note, working for a Major American Corporation can have its downsides. For example, Ramineni provided TechCrunch with a recording of our interview inside of Fireflies. This was nice, as I prefer to write from both my notes <em>and</em> transcripts to ensure that I am not missing things, or making mistakes. Fireflies kept asking me to log in. I tried with my corporate Google account. Which blocks such log-ins. So I kept getting the same prompt again and again.</p>
<p>Annoying? Sure. Lethal? No.</p>
<p>More when we can squeeze more growth data out of the startup.</p>
