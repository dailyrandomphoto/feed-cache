										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>As teammates at buy-now-pay-later fintech Affirm, <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah">Stella Han</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rlostrevino?lang=en">Carlos Treviño</a> bonded over their shared background of growing up in real estate families. The mission of ‘pay at your own pace’ at Affirm clashed with their first-hand experience of the taxing time commitment and high costs that comes with owning real estate; a contrast that eventually seeded the idea for Fractional.</p>
<p>Fractional, a San Francisco-based startup, wants to make real estate ownership more accessible. The platform, which participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 batch, helps people co-own investment properties with friends and strangers. It takes out some of the logistical challenges of finding property, and also removes financial barriers by allowing people to put smaller checks into a collective that will then invest into a property.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vision has brought over 400 users to its beta, who have gone on to co-invest across 95 properties. It’s also brought millions in early funding to the team: Fractional announced today that it has raised $5.5 million in total funding at a $30 million valuation. Fractional&#8217;s seed round is led by CRV, but includes Y Combinator, Will Smith, Kevin Durant, Goodwater Capital, Unusual Ventures, Global Founders Capital, On Deck, Contrary Capital and Soma Capital.</p>
<p>Fractional breaks the home ownership process into three main parts. First, the startup either matches together co-owners or onboards a friend group to kickstart the underwriting process, which blends well with the co-founder’s experience at Affirm. Then, it helps facilitate the purchase through legal and financial software services. Finally, it partners with property management companies and other services to make sure the co-owned homes stay in good shape (without the time commitment from its new co-owners).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ppnjnZKqma"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/community-is-the-new-ai/">Community is the new AI</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Community is the new AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/community-is-the-new-ai/embed/#?secret=ppnjnZKqma" data-secret="ppnjnZKqma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Fractional certainly for some of the financial hurdles of real estate ownership, friends may stray away from getting into business with each other due to the sheer pressure it can put on a relationship. What if life circumstances cause one person to want to sell before others? Or another refuses to upgrade the kitchen?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite their backgrounds, the co-founders know that scaling access as a service within real estate is uniquely complex. So, Han and Treviño pooled together cash and bought a plot of land in Mexico to more closely understand the process. Treviño’s family owns a construction business in Mexico so the duo was able to find an off market deal for a good price and eventually build a retail storefront on the property. But, as Han recalls, &#8220;the process wasn&#8217;t super smooth&#8221; and they had to pay a lawyer about $750 an hour to understand the mechanics of the process.</p>
<p>“We had to hire a lawyer because I just wanted to make sure we had a good model between the two of us on how we make decisions, how we resolve conflicts.”</p>

<p>CRV general partner Saar Gur thinks that the social networking layer of Fractional, &#8220;where new and experienced investors participate in a symbiotic environment&#8221;  is one of its distinguishing factors, according to a statement. &#8220;This also lets Fractional drive constant engagement on the platform beyond raw transactions and fuel their growth through organic word of mouth instead of aggressive paid marketing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The rise of alternative investing, from NFT ownership to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/step-aside-nfts-aqua-thinks-modern-investors-should-dive-into-private-equity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">private equity funds,</a> may trigger more adoption. Consumers are getting comfortable with the idea of diversifying their portfolios away from traditional public equities, and Fractional is a platform that capitalizes on one of the better-known asset classes out there &#8211; real estate.</p>
<p>Not Boring Capital’s Packy McCormick, who is an angel investor in Fractional, thinks the startup brings a highly scalable, high margin business to a typically hard-to-scale, low margin business.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s been most impressive to me is that in an industry that&#8217;s been very asset heavy- you need to buy a house and do construction and then sell it, or buy an asset and then let people invest,&#8221; the investor and writer told TechCrunch. &#8220;They&#8217;ve taken a pure software approach that doesn&#8217;t compromise the ease of the process and still gives people the hands-on feel of owning a house.”&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s e-commerce initiatives now include livestream shopping and Walmart will be the first retailer to test the new platform. Over the past year, Walmart has invested in live shopping by hosting events across social platforms like TikTok and YouTube, and soon it will debut Twitter&#8217;s first-ever shoppable livestream. On November 28, Walmart will kick off a Cyber Deals live event on Twitter, where users will be able to watch a live broadcast, shop the featured products, and join the conversation around the event by posting tweets.</p>
<p>The livestream will begin at 7 PM ET on Nov. 28, 2021, and will allow Walmart customers to shop from Twitter as well as a number of other platforms, including Walmart.com/live, and the retailer&#8217;s Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube accounts. Musician-turned-creator Jason Derulo will host the livestream where he&#8217;ll introduce the audience to deals in electronics, home goods, apparel, seasonal décor, and more during a 30-minute variety show. Surprise special guests will also drop in, says Walmart.</p>

<p>Walmart has been broadening its support for livestream shopping throughout 2021. It hosted its first shoppable livestream last December when it worked with TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">on its Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular event,</a> shortly after its planned investment in the video app fell through. (Walmart was interested in a deal for TikTok following Trump&#8217;s executive order that would have forced a sale of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations. But Trump&#8217;s order was blocked by the courts.)</p>
<p>That first TikTok live event proved successful, Walmart said at the time, having delivered 7x more views than had been anticipated. It also helped Walmart grow its TikTok follower base by 25%. Though the retailer didn&#8217;t detail the sales revenue the event delivered, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">ran a second TikTok livestream shopping event</a> just a few months later.</p>
<p>While Walmart&#8217;s bid for TikTok had signaled the retailer&#8217;s interest in live, social e-commerce, it saw potential outside of TikTok, as well. Over the past year, Walmart expanded livestream shopping tests to include other platforms. To date, Walmart has hosted more than 15 livestream events across five platforms, including its own website.</p>
<p>Those live commerce initiatives will now include Twitter, which is today revealing its new livestream shopping platform to the public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter says the Walmart Cyber Deals livestream will serve as the initial test of Live Shopping on Twitter in the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237959" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237959" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237959" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237959" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>This new platform expands upon Twitter&#8217;s existing shopping products and livestream capabilities.</p>
<p>It will include a live broadcast that streams at the top of a Live Event page, followed by a Shoppable Banner and Shop Tab where the products shown in the livestream are featured. Twitter users will be able to toggle back and forth between the &#8220;Lastest&#8221; tab and the &#8220;Shop&#8221; tab during the event as they preview the products. When consumers want to make a purchase, they&#8217;re directed to the retailer&#8217;s website within an in-app browser where the livestream will continue to be broadcast. That way, users won&#8217;t miss anything during checkout, Twitter says.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Live Event page, there&#8217;s also a text box where consumers can tweet about the livestream with a suggested hashtag.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are honored to have Walmart onboard as the first-ever brand to host a Live Shopping event on Twitter. Walmart is renowned for bringing customers an immersive look into their products and we are excited to bring this experience onto Twitter with them, while helping them reach their business objectives,&#8221; said Sarah Personette, Chief Customer Officer at Twitter, in a statement.  &#8220;This is just the first of many Live Shopping events we hope brands will be able to bring to market, and we can’t wait for people to watch, chat, and shop &#8212; all through Twitter,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The livestream shopping platform builds on Twitter&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"> earlier tests of a Shop Module</a>, launched in July, that gave brands, businesses, and retailers a way to showcase their products directly on their Twitter profiles. The test was meant to better understand if there was demand for shopping on Twitter, and had included a handful of pilot partners like gaming retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop">GameStop</a> and travel brand <a href="https://twitter.com/ArdenCove">Arden Cove</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Walmart said it was interested in testing Twitter&#8217;s new capabilities because it consistently sees high returns across top- and middle-of-funnel content on Twitter&#8217;s platform, which makes it a natural next step for Walmart&#8217;s explorations into social commerce.</p>
<p>The new Twitter livestream event represents the start of a bigger push into live shopping over the 2021 holiday season for Walmart. The company says it has over 30 shoppable livestream events planned across eight social and media platforms, including BuyWith, BuzzFeed, Facebook, IGN, TalkShopLive, Tasty, Twitter, and YouTube. (TikTok was not listed, but Walmart told us it&#8217;s working closely with the TikTok team on future shoppable livestreams.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter continues to be an important platform for Walmart’s business and our customers,&#8221; said William White, Chief Marketing Officer at Walmart U.S. &#8220;We’ve been focused on charting new territory in shoppable livestreams and are excited to celebrate an important milestone together with the first Livestream Shopping event on Twitter. We’re meeting customers where they are and making it easier to shop incredible deals and find inspiration through dynamic, interactive experiences. We look forward to continuing to bring engaging experiences to our customers that allow them to shop seamlessly while also being entertained,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Following the initial test of Live Shopping with Walmart, Twitter says it will start testing a new way to house merchant onboarding and product catalog management tools through an interface called the &#8220;Twitter Shopping Manager.&#8221; This will simplify the process of getting started with Shopping on Twitter, the company says. It also plans to make the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-shopping--testing-shoppable-profiles-on-twitter">Shop Module</a> available to more retailers over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch it doesn&#8217;t take a cut of the e-commerce revenues delivered through Live Shopping nor are brands paying to be included. But offering live shopping on Twitter could entice more users to join the platform, which has historically struggled with growing consumer adoption.</p>
<p>The live event will be available on Twitter on iOS and desktop in the U.S., starting on Nov. 28th at 7 PM ET/4 PM PT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The way COVID-19 has changed the way we work comes up a lot, founders have had to pivot and innovate to build companies during lockdown but the workplace restrictions seemed to spark inspiration for this week&#8217;s guest, Larry Gadea, founder, and CEO of Envoy. Envoy started in 2013 as a guest sign-in platform to make offices safer and more efficient. Over the past 18 months, they&#8217;ve created new products to solve for many of the new issues offices have as they adapt to the new and frequently changing office safety protocols.  Larry talks about how remote work affected company culture, his work-life balance philosophy, and how his leadership style has grown with the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paytm's IPO price was simply too high compared to its recent financial results. Trailing results matter as well, and Paytm's were just too weak to support its IPO price.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you weren&#8217;t paying close attention, you might have expected a different result from Paytm&#8217;s IPO. After all, the company is incredibly well-funded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/29/alibaba-increases-its-investment-in-indian-payments-and-commerce-firm-paytm/">by investors that you know by name</a>, and the Indian fintech giant has sufficiently scaled into a global brand.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>After debuting last Thursday, Paytm has notched two double-digit declines, measured in percentage terms, during its first two days of trading. As far as going public is concerned, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">seeing your share price fall 27%</a> and then 13% is about as bad as it can go.</p>
<p>So, what happened? To understand the lackluster Paytm IPO &#8212; technically the public offering from One 97 Communications, Paytm&#8217;s parent company &#8212; we&#8217;re going back to the company&#8217;s IPO filing, which we&#8217;ll augment with a new filing that dropped today containing a few more data points concerning its performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What we want to know is whether we can spot in the numbers enough reason to understand the company&#8217;s awful post-IPO performance. Was Paytm simply mispriced in its public debut? If so, we don&#8217;t have to spend as much time wondering if the larger Indian stock market is less than welcoming toward tech unicorns.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/manish-singh/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Manish Singh</a>, we also have some analyst numbers to lean up against for support. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Paytm&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>To avoid this post going on for more words than you want to read, we&#8217;ll skip a deep dive into what Paytm offers the market. Let it suffice to say that it offers payments, bill pay and loans to the Indian market, among other efforts.</p>
<p>So how good of a business is fintech in India? Let&#8217;s take a peek at <a href="https://www.axiscapital.co.in/uploads/equity_documents/20210716104312_one_97_communications_limited__drhp.pdf">the company&#8217;s IPO filing</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web hosting giant GoDaddy has reported a data breach with U.S. financial regulators, and warns that data on 1.2 million customers may have been accessed.</p>
<p>In a filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm">with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, GoDaddy&#8217;s chief information security officer Demetrius Comes said the company detected unauthorized access to its systems where it hosts and manages its customers&#8217; WordPress servers. WordPress is a web-based content management system used by millions to set up blogs or websites. GoDaddy lets customers host their own WordPress installs on their servers.</p>
<p>GoDaddy said the unauthorized person used a compromised password to get access to GoDaddy&#8217;s systems around September 6. GoDaddy said it discovered the breach last week on November 17. It&#8217;s not clear if the compromised password was protected with two-factor authentication.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The filing said that the breach affects 1.2 million active and inactive managed WordPress users, who had their email addresses and customer numbers exposed. GoDaddy said this exposure could put users at greater risk of phishing attacks. The web host also said that the original WordPress admin password created when WordPress was first installed, which could be used to access a customer&#8217;s WordPress server, was also exposed.</p>
<p>The company said that active customers had their sFTP credentials (for file transfers), and the usernames and passwords for their WordPress databases, which store all the user&#8217;s content, exposed in the breach. In some cases, the customer&#8217;s SSL (HTTPS) private key was exposed, which if abused could allow an attacker to impersonate a customer&#8217;s website or services.</p>
<p>GoDaddy said it&#8217;s reset customer WordPress passwords and private keys, and is in the process of replacing new SSL certificates.</p>
<p>The web host has more than 20 million customers worldwide. A spokesperson for GoDaddy did not immediately comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SmarterSelect, a U.S.-based company that provides software for managing the application process for scholarships, exposed the personal data of thousands of applicants because of a misconfigured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-cloud-storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a> bucket.</p>
<p>The data spill, <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/smarterselect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered by cybersecurity company UpGuard</a>, contained 1.5 terabytes of data collected by a number of programs that offer financial support to students. The data included documents such as academic transcripts, resumes and invoices for approximately 1.2 million applications to funding programs, dated from November 2020 to September 21, 2021. SmarterSelect&#8217;s website says it has served <a href="https://www.smarterselect.com/blog/who-we-are-and-what-weve-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 million people</a> to date.</p>
<p>One folder hosted on the public bucket hosted 23,000 spreadsheets and 8,000 ZIP files, according to UpGuard’s analysis. For applicants, these files contained contact information like name, email address and phone number, as well as much more probing details such as their parents&#8217; education and income, the students’ performance at school, and personal experiences like living in a foster home or abusive situations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some files also contained longer documents such as letters of recommendation and personal essays detailing poverty, physical and sexual abuse, domestic violence and other personal information, UpGuard said.</p>
<p>Another directory, which contained some 2.79 million files, included even more sensitive data on applicants. This includes student photos where required for application, financial documents such as Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms that in some cases included full Social Security numbers, proof of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> vaccinations and descriptions of hardships.</p>
<p>UpGuard first notified SmarterSelect about the breach on September 15 and then again on September 27. The company acknowledged the warning on September 30, before revoking public access to the bucket on October 5. It&#8217;s not known whether any malicious actors accessed the data while it was exposed.</p>
<p>“The contents of the bucket also serve as a reminder of the risks of collecting and retaining sensitive data, particularly for populations like college students,” UpGuard said. “The process of applying to, attending, and securing funding for university education requires young people to provide detailed information about themselves to a complex institutional supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even well-intentioned programs aiming to assist students who have been disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control &#8212; in fact, especially those programs that seek to help those most in need &#8212; require a detailed accounting of the facts of one’s life.”</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether SmarterSelect has notified those affected by the breach, nor whether it has alerted the relevant state attorney general offices per data breach notification law. TechCrunch asked SmarterSelect for comment but did not immediately hear back.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you’re wearing multiple hats while managing your startup’s operations, there&#8217;s hardly any time to stop and think about what would happen if things were to go catastrophically wrong. You probably don’t consider the consequences if you were to die suddenly, leaving the venture you spent so much blood, sweat and tears building without a leader.</p>
<p>It’s even less often that we think about what happens <em>after</em> we pass away — when state courts hand the business to an unprepared family member or tie up business assets for months or years until your estate is settled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, without an estate plan in place, these scenarios are entirely likely. I cannot stress enough how important it is for startup founders and business owners to have a plan. It doesn’t just protect your assets &#8212; it keeps your legacy intact.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

			This may seem a bit bleak, but having an estate plan will put your mind at ease.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We repeatedly hear about the very real consequences when business owners die without an estate plan that dictates their wishes legally. Just a year ago, the former CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-zappos-ceo-tony-hsiehs-death-is-ruled-accident-by-medical-examiner-11606779833?mod=article_inline">died in a fire</a> at 46. Prior to this, he had retired with an estimated net worth of $840 million, but his family has since declared that he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-death-of-zappos-tony-hsieh-a-spiral-of-alcohol-drugs-and-extreme-behavior-11607264719">died intestate</a>.</p>
<p>Now they are desperately trying to file for access to the former CEO’s accounts and assets but to no avail. And what makes the case even more tragic is that Hsieh had a plethora of charitable interests and would have undoubtedly wanted to donate some of his wealth upon his passing.</p>
<p>A recent survey from LegalZoom.com found that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/05/op-ed-more-people-are-creating-wills-amid-the-pandemic.html">62%</a> of Americans don’t have an estate plan in place. However, 32% of young people aged 18 to 34 say they have sorted out an estate scheme due to the pandemic. What’s more, 21% of that group said they created a plan specifically because they or someone they knew had COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We all want to build businesses that are timeless and are going to last for decades, so you should make sure your business is in good hands no matter what happens. With COVID-19 bringing estate planning into sharper focus, let’s look at what you can do to ensure stress-free planning.</p>
<h2>Get your documents in order</h2>
<p>For starters, any startup owner needs to look into the documents required for an estate plan to be put in place.</p>
<p>Every adult in America should have a medical and financial power of attorney and a will. The medical and financial power of attorney are documents that empower someone you trust to make decisions for you during your lifetime if you become incapable of leading your business. If none of that is organized and you become incapacitated or die, the state comes in and makes decisions for you, regardless of what you may have chosen.</p>
<p>Aside from the documents you need to have in place for an estate plan (the power of attorney, health proxy and a will), it is also worth considering creating a living trust with all your assets and a “pour-over will” associated with it. This means that in the event of an untimely death, the distribution of your assets to beneficiaries is a much smoother process because the courts don’t need to step in to grant executor authority.</p>
<p>In the case of a sole proprietorship, were you to pass away, the business could simply dissolve, depending on your state’s intestacy laws. Or, the courts may award the sole proprietorship to your spouse or other surviving family members, which presents additional issues.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a marriage was on the rocks to the point where one party was filing for divorce but also owned a very successful business and suddenly died. In that case, the spouse could inherit the company, which would certainly not be in the deceased’s interests.</p>
<p>Estate planning services can walk you through the different elements needed for each document. For example, this could refer to distributing assets to your beneficiaries or assigning a guardian for your children.</p>
<p>Once that is done, the documents will need to be notarized, and in the case of a will or power of attorney, you will need a witness to be present. The final step is uploading them to a digital portal — some companies can even offer 24/7 access.</p>
<h2>A constantly evolving situation</h2>
<p>An estate plan needs adjusting throughout your life, particularly if you own a burgeoning startup that might become a major player in your sector later down the line. Ideally, you would update an estate plan annually, around the time when tax returns are due, but the situation can be much more fluid depending on the state of your business.</p>
<p>It’s possible that your business assets rapidly gain value, or you decide that you want to take a different approach toward your succession planning (anyone who has seen the TV drama “Succession” knows just how complex this can be).</p>
<p>You must decide whom you trust to take over your company if something happens to you. It is not just about having an estate plan that expresses your wishes &#8212; it’s almost equally important to communicate it with a written succession plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning%C2%A0">HBR estimates that</a> company valuations and investor returns would be 20% to 25% higher with better succession planning, which must be coordinated with your will to avoid the possibility of conflicting rights to any of your assets. Ideally, you want to give this person as much notice as possible, so they are prepared for your death and don’t have to spend unnecessary time and money hiring a lawyer or filling out paperwork.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that when it comes to dividing the value of your assets, valuations can change, which is why updating your estate plan is crucial.</p>
<p>For example, you might decide to donate a percentage of your total estate to the church, but if the value of your estate increases over a few years, this sum could end up being far greater than you initially thought. Similarly, if you assign a significant cash value to a particular party, and your estate loses value, they could be receiving much more than you would be comfortable giving.</p>
<p>Although we have discussed estate planning from the status of high-net-worth individuals, and some startups may not consider themselves at this stage just yet, it has to be a consideration for the future. As of January 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alangassman/2021/03/27/senate-estate-and-gift-tax-bill-will-reduce-exemption-to-3500000-and-take-away-many-opportunities/">up to $3.5 million</a> in net worth would not be taxed federally after you die.</p>
<p>However, any amount over that would be taxed at the federal estate tax rate up to 40%. Therefore, if a successful founder were to pass away without an estate plan in place, they could leave both legal difficulties for their family and their estate could lose a considerable amount to federal tax.</p>
<p>This may seem a bit bleak, but having an estate plan will put your mind at ease.</p>
<p>I don’t want to fear-monger; instead, I want to highlight the costly and damaging impact when something happens and you don’t have an estate plan in place. Startup owners can be forgiven for not considering estate planning previously, as leaders are often working nonstop to get their business off the ground, but not taking the time to get on top of it could cause many problems farther down the line.</p>
<p>Taking these steps and being wary of the cautions outlined above will save undue stress for you and your family should the worst ever happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket startup-turned-public company Astra Space is flying high Monday morning, with stock prices increasing as much as 42% since markets opened thanks to the company’s first successful orbital flight late Saturday evening. But now the real work begins, as the company seeks to commence commercial operations and roll out new rocket versions for flight testing next year.</p>
<p>Rocket LV0007 (also called Rocket 3.3) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/astra-successfully-reaches-orbit-for-the-first-time-with-latest-rocket-launch/">launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex</a> in Kodiak, Alaska, and successfully delivered a payload for the U.S. Space Force as part of the department’s Space Test Program. It’s a huge boost for Astra, which now joins a very small club of private companies that have managed to reach orbit.</p>
<p>“This is really hard and all it takes is one thing to go wrong,” CEO Chris Kemp told reporters during a press conference Monday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Astra’s taken an agile and iterative approach to testing, rapidly building out launch rockets (which have a serial number naming convention) and hosting test flights in relatively quick succession. As a result, the company’s experienced its share of failure &#8212; including the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">flight test of LV0006</a>, during which an engine anomaly caused the rocket to drift sideways before reaching around 50 km. But the persistence has paid off.</p>
<p>“A lot of these things are very difficult to test unless you&#8217;re in flight conditions,” Kemp explained. “We did this at record pace because of this iterative approach and I don&#8217;t think we would have gotten there on this schedule any other way.”</p>
<p>Leading up to the launch, the company got a lot of useful data not from flight simulations but from the natural environment: the sub-zero temperatures in Kodiak, Alaska, where Astra has a launch facility, Astra’s chief engineer Benjamin Lyon said Monday.</p>
<p>“We’ve never operated in these freezing temperatures before,” Kemp added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two executives confirmed that the next Rocket 3.3, LV0008, was close to launch readiness, though they said more details on flight dates and where it might take off from would be released at some point in the future. But because the launch of LV0007 went so smoothly, the company will likely not pour too much effort into any changes to further 3.3 versions, Kemp said. Instead, the company is turning its focus to Rocket 4.0, a new variant that should be able to carry heavier payloads than Rocket 3.3’s 50-kilogram payload capacity. The company will begin test flights of Rocket 4.0 next year.</p>
<p>Astra’s vision is to <a href="https://astra.com/news/qa-with-dr-adam-london-astra-cto-and-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually conduct daily space launches</a> using its small rocket system. Whether it will ultimately reach that target remains to be seen, but Kemp said launch demand has only increased over time.</p>
<p>“Since Astra went public […] almost a dozen companies that I would call space tech companies have gone public,” he said. “This gives them the resources to do more development or iterative design of spacecraft and satellites. I could only imagine that the demand will continue to grow, as we&#8217;ve seen over the past couple of years, so I think Astra really is in a position to deliver a payload to precise orbit on a precise schedule.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ericsson.com">Ericsson</a>, an international networking company, decided it needed a dose of modernization and this morning announced its intent to acquire cloud communications company <a href="http://vonage.com">Vonage</a> in a $6.2 billion deal.</p>
<p>With Vonage, Ericsson is getting a more modern approach to communications that includes a cloud contact center, communications APIs (like Twilio&#8217;s) and a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) solution. The company believes that it can build on its 4G and 5G networking technology by taking advantage of the key pieces of the Vonage family.</p>
<p>Börje Ekholm, Ericsson president and CEO, said that this is part of a strategy by the company to begin capturing more enterprise business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This provides the foundation to build an enterprise business. The acquisition of Vonage is the next step in delivering on that strategic priority. Vonage gives us a platform to help our customers monetize the investments in the network, benefiting developers and businesses,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ericsson is focused on Vonage&#8217;s communications APIs, which it believes will enable it to tap into a network of developers across the world building applications based on 4G and 5G technology.</p>
<p>Rory Read, CEO of Vonage, indicated it was a deal that was too good to turn down and sees combining forces with the much larger corporation as ultimately good for his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe joining Ericsson is in the best interests of our shareholders and is a testament to Vonage’s leadership position in business cloud communications, our innovative product portfolio and outstanding team,&#8221; Read said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Vonage, the company not only gets the technology portfolio &#8212; it gets a healthy business that generated $1.4 billion in the 12-month period ending September 30. It also gets access to 120,000 Vonage customers and more than 1 million registered developers, according to the company.</p>
<p>Vonage launched in 2001 with a VoIP product and raised almost $600 million, according to Crunchbase data, before going public in 2006. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/vonage-acquires-cloud-based-contact-center-startup-newvoicemedia-for-350m-in-cash/">It acquired cloud contact center</a> startup NewVoiceMedia in 2018 for $350 million.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s merger deal is subject to approval by the Vonage board and various regulatory bodies, but Ericsson still expects it to close sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Vonage stock is flying high this morning, up 25% on the news. Investors are less enamored with Ericsson, with stock down 4.89% as of publication.</p>

<p>Happy Monday everyone, and welcome to a holiday week here in the United States. Yes, we here in the good ol&#8217; States will be off the second half of this week. TechCrunch won&#8217;t grind to a halt, but we will certainly slow down a little bit.

<ul>
<li>Shares of Indian fintech giant Paytm fell further today, after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">very disappointing first-day&#8217;s trading last Thursday</a>. The company now has a lot of ground to make up just to get back to zero.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been countless studies about the damaging effects of social media on mental health, particularly on teens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, most of us just can’t quit social networking. Even if it makes us feel bad about ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The constant comparisons of our lives to the highlight reels that people post on Facebook and Instagram is ridiculously lopsided since the majority of those platforms&#8217; users don’t post unflattering photos of themselves, or share their sad or bad news with others.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.inpathy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inpathy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new kind of social network &#8212; a “healthy” one. Ziarekenya Smith founded the company in 2015 with a mission to revolutionize how people use social media “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by making it more transparent, normalizing moods, and recreating the human experience.” The end goal is to bring more wellness to the social network world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith started his career in digital art and design. Despite early success, he didn’t feel the work was as personally fulfilling as he’d hoped. He began to feel symptoms of anxiety and depression and found himself wanting to express those feelings on social media. But he stopped himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The unwritten rules of social are that if life isn’t perfect, you don’t talk about it,” Smith recalls. “So I kept my feelings to myself. But I asked myself &#8212; why was that the case?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept for Detroit-based </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fu5Za5kuYg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inpathy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was born from the pain and struggle he felt. It was also born out of Smith’s belief that the current social media structure is not sustainable in the long term.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s great for making money but not great for true human well-being,” Smith told TechCrunch. “In my eyes, we have to fix the core.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inpathy strives to offer a more balanced life experience, not just perfection. It aims to give people room to share their raw feelings, the good, not so good and the bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone’s going to have ups and downs, and you can appreciate someone’s rise more if you see the timeline of their up and down,” Smith says. “We all love the underdog story.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a twist, Inpathy’s users share their stories or content not through pictures or the written word, but via audio or video, providing what Smith hopes is an immersive experience.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fu5Za5kuYg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inpathy will ask a user how they are feeling and that mood scale is visible to other users, who can even filter by mood, including “angry,” “sad” and “happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to normalize emotion and create a transparent system,” Smith said. “It has to be transparent for us all to be on the same playing field. So people can realize, ‘It’s not just me. This is normal.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no follow or add buttons. Inpathy allows for two-way communication leading to users becoming “friends.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not robots. Whether you are rich or poor, you feel happiness and pain no matter your status,” Smith said. “ This is what human is. Inpathy is showing people it’s ok to be human.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The site has a low tolerance for trolls and bullies, banning them for life. The thought of someone building up the courage to share something on Inpathy and then get trolled to the point they are scared to open up again prompted the policy.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237496" style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237496" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2237496 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?w=617" alt="" width="617" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg 1260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?resize=136,150 136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?resize=272,300 272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?resize=768,846 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?resize=617,680 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Inpathy.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237496" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Inpathy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Smith is raising money through crowdfunding and essentially bootstrapping until he finds the right investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t want to be in the position of feeling like we have to add features just to impress investors,” he said. “Vision is very important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now if we look at the social </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">media landscape, we use YouTube for TV, TikTok for shorts, Instagram for photos, Twitter for news and trends, Facebook for entertainment, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn for business, Headspace for meditation, Tinder for dating,” Smith adds. “But where do you go for the raw experience, and to just be yourself?” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holidays, TikTok is expanding its footprint in the living room. The company earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tiktok-is-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-in-the-u-s-and-canada/">launched</a> its TV app in North America in partnership with Amazon Fire TV. Today, TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out</a> its TV app to more TV platforms across North America, including Google TV and other Android TV OS devices, and select LG Smart TVs and Samsung Smart TVs.</p>
<p>The TikTok TV app redesigns the popular short-form video app for the big screen.</p>
<p>Like its mobile counterpart, the app offers access to both a user&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; and &#8220;Following&#8221; feeds, when logged in, as well as a &#8220;Discover&#8221; page featuring some of the most popular content across the service, including in categories like comedy, gaming, food, travel, sports and animals, among others. But unlike on mobile, where users have to swipe vertically to navigate through the available videos, TikTok TV includes an AutoPlay feature that serves up a continuous feed without interruptions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To accommodate vertical videos on the wider TV screen, the app displays a dimmer version of the video in the background to make the experience more visually interesting, instead of just using black bars to fill in the screen space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237848" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237848" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tiktok-tv-app.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237848" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Before today, the company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had offered</a> a TikTok TV app for Google TV and Android TV in the U.K., France and Germany, but had yet to bring that version of the app to users in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, TikTok launched its TV app on Samsung TVs in the U.K. last year. Samsung said<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-tiktok-app-for-smart-tvs-coming-soon-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> it would roll out the app</a> to most of its 2021 smart TVs in the U.S. sometime this year.</p>
<p>TikTok also now says the new TV app will accommodate 2018-2021 LG Smart TV models running webOS 4.0 through webOS 6.0.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion may put TikTok in more direct competition with rival YouTube for consumers&#8217; attention.</p>
<p>Today, Google&#8217;s video app already has a strong presence in the living room, where now <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/watch-youtube-on-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 100 million U.S. users</a> watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their big screens. In addition, third-party <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-half-of-us-youtube-viewers-watch-on-ctv-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research from eMarketer</a> found that more than half of U.S. YouTube viewers, or 113.1 million people, now watch through a connected TV device, as of a report issued in October 2021.</p>
<p>However, many of those users may not be tuning into short-form content. The company last year <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-than-half-of-us-youtube-viewers-watch-on-ctv-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> watch time of YouTube content over 30 minutes long increased by more than 90% in a 12-month period. That could point to TV viewers&#8217; interest in longer-form video content compared with mobile users. With plans for its TV app underway, this may also have been a factor in TikTok&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">expand its maximum video length</a> to three minutes earlier this year.</p>
<p>TikTok, in its announcement, touted that it has <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a billion monthly users</a> &#8212; but of course, that includes many markets that don&#8217;t yet have access to the TikTok TV app.</p>
<p>The new TV app will be rolling out starting today to supported platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies increasingly move to take advantage of machine learning to run their business more efficiently, the fact is that it takes an abundance of energy to build, test and run models in production. <a href="http://Neu.ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neu.ro</a>, an early-stage full-stack MLOps solution, is building a greener approach.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a zero emissions AI cloud solution in conjunction with Finnish cloud infrastructure partner <a href="http://atnorth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atNorth</a>.</p>
<p>The company says that atNorth is providing a Tier 3, ISO 27001-certified data center, running Nvidia A100-powered DGX and HGX systems. The data center offers 80MW of power capacity, which runs entirely on geothermal and hydro energy. What&#8217;s more, due to its location near the arctic, it provides essentially free cooling, giving neu.ro an energy-efficient solution for customers to build machine learning models using its solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237807" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founder Max Prasolov says that they found after researching the problem, that computing and telecommunications is taking around 9% of total energy consumption worldwide, a number their research suggests could double in the next decade. They believe that machine learning model building will be a growing part of that, and they decided to team with atNorth to reduce their own carbon emissions footprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided just to move all our operations and all our experiments to the zero emission cloud. And the goal is not to be carbon neutral because we [know that we could] buy credits and compensate for [our usage]. The question is how to [achieve] zero emissions? We [realized] we spent so much energy and so much computing power to train our models for clients, and we understand that is definitely the biggest carbon footprint we [are producing],&#8221; Praslov said.</p>
<p>While the company was at it, it came up with a way through its software solution to build models in a more efficient way, which in turn, reduces the amount of energy needed and enables the company to deliver an even more sustainable solution.</p>
<p>In terms of the product itself, the company is offering a flexible, cloud-native service where they provide some of the tooling, but leave enough room for companies to fill in with the pieces they think work best for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The way that we approach it is instead of trying to build every single tool that needs to be built from data ingestion to monitoring to explainability to building pipeline engines, etc., we&#8217;re all about interoperability. We build what hasn&#8217;t been built, and we connect to the universe of Kubernetes-based tools that are already out there,&#8221; company co-founder Arthur McCallum explained.</p>
<p>The startup currently has a commercial solution, but it is working on an open source version of the stack which will be released shortly, probably before the end of the year. The company&#8217;s goal is to provide a cloud-based AI solution for smaller cloud vendors beyond the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. This would include regional vendors across the world.</p>
<p>Neu.ro launched in 2019 and came out with its first version of the solution last year. It has raised $2.3 million in seed funding so far, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are myriad tax pain points that come from selling goods, content or services globally.  As the world has seen a surge in cross-border transactions, digital-first businesses face the challenge of understanding and managing global tax and compliance matters as they grow and scale internationally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Dublin, Ireland-based </span><a href="https://www.fonoa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded by three ex-Uber alumni &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davor Tremac, Filip Sturman and Ivan Ivankovicz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; the two-year-old startup has developed APIs that help digital companies determine and calculate taxes they should collect on their internet sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa, which helps companies like Lime, Uber, Teachable and Zoom stay tax compliant, has raised a $20.5 million in a Series A round as more goods and services are sold online &#8212; especially across international markets. Its customers primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come from the ride-hailing, mobility, food delivery, SaaS and e-commerce industries, and also include subscription businesses. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Tremac says Fonoa’s APIs “easily” integrate with a customer’s existing data so they don’t have to spend hours figuring out tax matters manually. The company has surpassed 300 million tax transactions per year, as demand for its automated offering has grown. As a B2B SaaS operator, the company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“very healthy margins” and has seen 7x revenue growth since December 2020, according to Tremac. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the digital world, businesses and customers transact on a global scale. Country borders are no longer a limiting factor, and technology drives global trade at an ever-increasing speed,” he said. “Combined with the increased scrutiny by regulators, dealing with tax matters in a more automated and trusted way has become an ever-more pressing issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company provides a “plug-and-play modular platform” that it says verifies a buyer and seller’s tax status, calculates the correct tax to charge and creates a locally compliant invoice after a transaction takes place. It also allows for automatic reporting of transactions in real time to a country’s government, where needed.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237030" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237030" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2237030 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="469" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg 1235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fonoa-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fonoa</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic, Tremac said, accelerated Fonoa’s growth “significantly” as it brought online commerce many years forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More sales happening online means more work for us as each online transaction has to have a tax component,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMERS Ventures led Fonoa&#8217;s Series A financing, which included participation from Index Ventures, FJ Labs and Moving Capital. Index in November of 2020 led its $4.5 million seed round, which was not previously announced. Other backers include Gautam Gupta, former COO and CFO at Opendoor and Uber; Eventbrite founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Hartz; DoorDash CFO Prabir Adarkar; Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, former COO at GoCardless; and Fast COO Allison Barr Allen, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Uber alumni experienced firsthand how difficult it is to correctly calculate and report taxes to authorities throughout the world. So they set about developing technology that would automate taxes for the entire internet economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonoa currently supports tax automation transactions across more than 100 countries today and has the goal of expanding to over 140 countries by year’s end with the help of its new capital. It also plans to use the money toward hiring. Although it is based in Dublin, Fonoa &#8212; like many other startups these days &#8212; is remote-first, with a 60-person distributed team working in 15 countries. It is looking to hire another 60 people in the U.S., Europe, Asia and LatAm across engineering, product, sales, recruiting and operations. The company also plans to use the funds to extend the coverage of current products as well as “build completely new ones,” Tremac said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using all resources available to double down on growth as the opportunities ahead of us are massive,” he told TechCrunch. “We will keep expanding until we cover all relevant use cases for all of our products across all geographies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannah Seal, principal at Index Ventures, believes that Fonoa unlocks growth for companies that operate internationally, and would otherwise be “bogged down” by the complexity of national tax regimes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This focus on enabling growth, not simply back-office automation, attracted us to Fonoa in the first place,” Seal wrote via e-mail. “Having run Uber in multiple markets, the team has a deep understanding of the challenges of scaling across borders and has developed products that allow companies to add and expand new geographies seamlessly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jambu Palaniappan, managing partner at OMERS Ventures, described Fonoa’s product as “the best and most complete offering in the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are focused on the full tax stack from validations to real-time reporting and have put technology rather than consulting at the core of their product,” he wrote via email. “With governments around the world more concerned than ever about compliance, now is the perfect time for Fonoa to build a globally relevant platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://z1.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Z1</a>, a Brazilian neobank focused on offering digital accounts and a linked prepaid card to teenagers and young adults, secured $10 million in Series A funding just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/homebrew-leads-z1s-effort-to-bring-digital-banking-to-latin-americas-teens/">taking in $2.5 million</a>.</p>
<p>Co-founded in 2019 by João Pedro Thompson, Thiago Achatz, Mateus Craveiro and Sophie Secaf, Z1 developed a digital bank app aimed at helping Brazilian and Latin American teenagers become more financially independent.</p>
<p>Since the last raise in April, the company’s revenue grew 26 times and continues to do so at almost 40% per month, CEO Thompson said via email. Z1 also grew its customer base by eight times during the same time at a rate of 30% per month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kaszak led the latest round and was joined by existing investors MAYA Capital, Homebrew, Clocktower and The Chainsmokers. Going after new capital so soon was not on the company’s radar, Thompson said.</p>

<p>“Our plan was to raise again early next year, however, Kaszek reached out to us in July and convinced us to anticipate our Series A,” he said. “From the outset, it was clear they would be the ideal partner for us in the next phase of the company, and that we would benefit greatly from having them onboard.”</p>
<p>The new capital will enable Z1 to increase its employees in areas like engineering, product, marketing and customer experience, with plans to go from 60 to over 100 within the next three months. That additional manpower will provide support as the company aims to grow 10 times over the next 12 months and add new features to enhance the financial inclusion and literacy of customers.</p>
<p>Along with the announcement of the new funding, the company also said it would begin to offer its core banking experience for free. It had been charging a monthly subscription fee of $2 per month.</p>
<p>Thompson attributes some of Z1’s growth to the fact that a year ago, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-banks-payment-platform/brazil-launches-pix-instant-payments-system-whatsapp-to-enter-soon-idUSKBN27W25C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Brazilian Central Bank launched PIX</a>, an instant payments system where individuals and organizations can send and receive money instantly through an identification number, phone number or email for free, a service that he likened to “a government-built version of Venmo.”</p>
<p>Since PIX’s launch it is estimated that 105 million people, about half of Brazil’s population, registered to use it, Thompson said. He called it “a key enabler of financial inclusion, as many people have entered the formal economy because of it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“PIX use among Gen Z (and consequently Z1 users) is higher than that of older generations, as the convenience and social aspect of sending and receiving money through PIX have been heavily explored by younger users,” he added.</p>
<p>Monica Saggioro, co-founder and partner at MAYA Capital, said via email that her firm doubled down on its investment in Z1 for a number of reasons, including that Gen Z is a growing, yet underserved market, and the firm believes there is great value in serving it well with dedicated products to their needs.</p>
<p>What she says many banks are trying to do is solve too many things at the same time, and that results in solving none of them very well. Instead, Z1 is uniquely positioned to serve the Gen Z population and evolve with its customers, and she has yet to find another company with a similar proposition.</p>
<p>“JP and Thiago were entrepreneurs-in-residence at MAYA, so we have been able to see them take Z1 from scratch and gain significant traction,” she added. “We are impressed with their capacity to envision, execute and attract top talent, which make a perfect combination of qualities we look for in founders.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Generation Z is already the largest generation in the world today, representing about 30% of the Brazilian and world population,” added Kaszek partner Nico Berman in a written statement. “Whoever can understand and capture this generation&#8217;s preferences now will reap the rewards in the coming years and decades. We believe the Z1 team is uniquely positioned to do that given their true purpose and deep understanding of this new generation of consumers.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is growing at an incredible pace — 15 times in gross merchandise volume in just the last 30 days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alice Deng and Lawrence Murata were working at artificial intelligence companies when they found inspiration from their respective family&#8217;s businesses to create <a href="https://www.slope.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slope</a>, which enables businesses an easy way to offer buy now, pay later services.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, suppliers were extending net terms of 30 days to pay, but at that scale, it is hard to build up credit for small businesses, Murata told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Then with the global pandemic, the pace at which business-to-business payment was moving online was accelerating,” Murata told TechCrunch. “We wanted to bring it online at checkout and empower businesses by making access to capital easy.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Businesses can get approved in seconds and begin offering the installments. At checkout, customers can choose the payment terms that work for them. Slope manages the lending, underwriting and any debt collection, and will pay out to the business once the product or service ships.</p>

<p>Deng and Murata are two-time Y Combinator founders, most recently attending the 2021 summer cohort. They actually went into the batch with a different company and pivoted to the business model Slope is today, launching in August.</p>
<p>Already, the company is growing at an incredible pace — 15 times in gross merchandise volume in just the last 30 days. In the past three months is has acquired merchant customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, India and Singapore. It will soon add merchants to its waitlist from China, Brazil and Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $8 million in seed funding from a group of backers that include Global Founders Capital and founders of Dropbox, DoorDash, Opendoor, Plaid, PlanGrid, Mercury and Pilot. The core focus for the new funding is to grow Slope’s team, build out the infrastructure for customer-centric experiences and get merchants onboarded from the waitlist.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/b2b-payments-market-A08183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global B2B payments market</a> was valued at $870 billion in 2020, with projections of reaching $1.9 trillion by 2028. At the same time, it was estimated that <a href="https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/3460/Global%2BTechnology_%2BB2B_%2BHow%2Bthe%2Bnext%2Bpayments%2Bfrontier%2Bwill%2Bunleash%2Bsmall%2Bbusiness%2B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$127 trillion of payment flows are attributed to B2B payments</a>, and this is expected to rise to $200 trillion, also by 2028.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our vision is to be Stripe for global B2B,” Deng said. “Winning in B2B requires building infrastructure and a core competency in global cross border transactions, that B2C players like Affirm and Afterpay haven&#8217;t had to grapple with.”</p>
<p>In addition, the co-founders interviewed hundreds of small businesses about the need for BNPL and ended up signing deals even before Slope had a product, which Deng noted was validation that this was a huge need in the market.</p>
<p>Don Stalter, partner at Global Founders Capital, said Slope’s growth was “impressive from the start, and one of the fastest-growing companies we have seen globally, at its stage and leanness of the team.”</p>
<p>Businesses have gone to banks for business loans, but it was a “janky process,” and anyone who can improve it at a rate of five times with technology will be a major disrupter, and if they can do it 100 time, they will revolutionize it, he added.</p>
<p>He believes Deng and Lawrence can do this by taking that big B2B payments market and attacking it with artificial intelligence and new technology that is going to improve opportunities for businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With demand for plant-based meat alternatives at an all-time high, Eclipse Foods is no doubt hoping to do for ice cream what companies like Impossible and Beyond have managed for the hamburger. Pre-pandemic, the company announced select retail availability in New York and its native San Francisco, and now it’s expanding coverage with a high-profile retail partnership.</p>
<p>Launched in early 2019, the company has raised nearly $16 million to date, including funding from YC. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/plant-based-dairy-replacements-are-coming-to-ice-cream-pints-in-san-francisco-and-new-york/">In an earlier interview with TechCrunch</a>, CEO Aylon Steinhart noted that the company looks to differentiate itself from other plant-based foodstuffs with a simple approach to provide an alternative food source.</p>
<p>“We’re not using any expensive biotech to get to where we’re going,” the exec noted. “We take plants and we use our world-class expertise in functional plant proteins and how they work to blend plants together in a quite simple way.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234374" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Eclipse is still looking to mimic dairy-based ice cream more directly. “Entering Whole Foods Market, a retailer synonymous for offering premium ingredient, high-caliber products, marks an important moment for Eclipse as we continue to grow our retail presence nationwide,” Steinhart said in a release.</p>
<p>The ice cream will be available at select locations in Northern California to start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps cloud platform <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/render-challenges-the-clouds-biggest-vendors-with-cheaper-managed-infrastructure/">which won our Disrupt SF 2019 Startup Battlefield</a>, announced today that it closed a $20 million Series A funding round led by Addition alongside existing investors General Catalyst and South Park Commons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition first made a small investment in Render in February 2020 when the company was not looking to raise a round, co-founder and CEO Anurag Goel told TechCrunch in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Render <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/render-raises-4-5m-for-its-devops-platform/">announced its last raise</a> in October 2020, a seed round for $4.5 million, after seeing strong inbound interest on the heels of Disrupt. The latest round brings the startup’s total funding to $26.75 million. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237650" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San-Francisco based company will use the proceeds to triple its employee base, currently 35 people, by the end of 2022, with a focus on product and customer growth, Goel said. It also plans to expand its data center footprint globally to at least 10 new regions in 2022 to improve latency, launching for the first time in both APAC and EMEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the new features it plans to roll out are a free plan for web services and databases to increase access to its product, as well as built-in DDoS protection for its customers, Goel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Render’s customers use its platform for their entire cloud presence, according to Goel. Some of its notable customers include publicly-traded </span><a href="https://us.anker.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, online developer community </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indie Hackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Web3 platform </span><a href="https://near.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEAR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goel added that many of its customers host popular open-source projects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Elasticsearch, MySQL and MongoDB on Render as an alternative to expensive managed versions of these services, because Render has simplified the process of managing such projects.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Render competes with the “big three” cloud providers &#8212; Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud &#8212; by offering a large suite of features at a competitive cost. Goel said many of Render’s customers migrate to its platform from Heroku and AWS because it provides “increased flexibility, better performance, and access to modern features </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like infrastructure-as-code, private networking and persistent storage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a customer chooses what service to deploy, Render helps them manage the process and infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AWS and other large providers were built for the 2000s, when managing infrastructure was the norm at every company,” Goel said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the big three offerings require expensive and scarce DevOps engineering resources to manage, we offer simplicity and a world-class developer experience at a fraction of the cost.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Diego-based startup <a href="http://lifevoxel.ai/">LifeVoxel</a> has raised $5 million in a seed round to bolster data intelligence of its AI diagnostic visualization platform for faster and precise prognosis.</p>
<p>The platform, dubbed Prescient, is used for diagnostics, workflow management and triage, taking away the stress of managing software and hardware technology from physicians and hospitals &#8212; and allowing them to focus on patient care.</p>
<p>The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform is used by healthcare facilities for remote diagnostics in various medical fields including radiology, cardiology and orthopedics. The platform stores diagnostic imagery, enabling physicians to analyze them, on-demand, from any device including mobile phones. It also includes features that makes it possible to include diagnostic annotations and reports.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237801" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We plan to spend the funds secured in this round to build out our deep learning AI models and machine learning algorithms to provide data intelligence to be able to identify similarities, abnormalities, and predictive diagnoses to help improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis,” LifeVoxel founder and chief architect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/koveykovalan/">Kovey Kovalan</a> told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“In short, with our continued growth, we can help medical professionals figure out what is wrong with patients faster so they can begin the work of healing them sooner,” said Kovalan.</p>
<p>The round drew an array of investors including medical and radiology specialists and high-networth individuals with an interest in medical technology.</p>
<p>Kovalan, who was born and raised in Malaysia, studied computer science in Ohio State University, and on completion, went on to specialize in artificial intelligence. Research and interest later led him to apply artificial intelligence using GPU to offer medical imaging classification, resulting in the development of the platform, which his company says “enables zero-latency interactivity of medical images over internet.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform is designed to save about 50% cost of technology costs for hospitals using the software, and allows them to expand or scale down depending on the needs of the institutions. It also enables physicians to access patients and their data from anywhere in the world, making it possible to deliver speedier patient care.</p>
<p>He is hoping to use the platform to change the current landscape of medical imaging where images are hosted on-premises, making it hard for collaboration, and in harnessing it for artificial intelligence. The startup hopes to use the technologies for the improvement in diagnostic outcome using intelligent visualization.</p>
<p>“For rural populations currently lacking in specialists, the platform’s ability to turn any device into a radiology workstation offers access to the same network of specialist physicians for imaging study review as urban areas. Recently such techniques were deployed during the pandemic to provide first-of-a-kind interactive 3D VR Telepresence between remote proctors thousands of miles away and surgeons within operating rooms.”</p>
<p>The startup’s technology is timely as more healthcare institutions expand their remote and telemedicine capabilities &#8212; which has largely been fueled by the Covid pandemic. This is in addition to increased adoption of AI-enabled technologies for better patient outcomes as more hospitals move away from conventional cloud-based systems.</p>
<p>“Medical imaging and radiology need dynamic solutions to replace the inadequacies in conventional systems,” said co-founder, president and CEO of LifeVoxel Sekhar Puli.</p>
<p>“With this round of funding, we will be able to accelerate not only our vision to be the de facto platform for medical imaging applications across the globe but make significant strides in the Telehealth imaging and advanced tech-based AI solutions for the future of healthcare.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pet item sales topped $100 billion in 2020, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pets are big business. Sales in this area <a href="https://www.bioguardlabs.com/pandemic-era-pet-industry-surpasses-record-breaking-100-billion-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped $100 billion in 2020</a>, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years. However, in that same period, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jul/27/veterinarians-face-high-demand-treat-pets-amid-ado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5,000 new veterinarians were added</a>, causing delays in getting appointments and added <a href="https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/news/2021/05/26/alarming-suicide-rates-reflective-stresses-felt-veterinarians/7361193002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress upon veterinarians</a> to manage their practices.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://yourfuzzy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzzy</a> announced $44 million in growth funding to expand its digital pet care network of veterinary professionals to alleviate some of the strain on the industry and make care accessible and affordable to all. The San Francisco-based company previously raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fuzzy-lands-18m-series-b-for-pet-telemedicine-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18 million in a Series B round</a> in March.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2016, provides 24/7 live chat and telehealth, ship-to-home prescriptions, vet-curated items in its e-commerce marketplace and educational content and programs. Its digitally-native approach can save pet parents up to $750 a year on healthcare expenses, Zubin Bhettay, co-founder and CEO of Fuzzy, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The big story in 2020 was that everyone needed telehealth services for themselves, and we saw that transfer to pets and then exacerbated by the industry,” he added. “The surge in people getting pets caused emergency room waits to grow to up to 10 hours, while it started taking four to six weeks to get a vet appointment.”</p>
<p>By leading the shift to more telehealth services, Fuzzy hopes to encourage pet parents to consider the health of their pet on a more regular basis to aid in their longevity. The company has facilitated more than 1 million consultations to date and with it, amassed data and operation expertise to be able to expand delivery care at scale.</p>
<p>Bhettay wasn’t planning to raise additional funds so soon after the Series B, but said accelerated growth in the business enabled the company to hire more, check off more of the to-do list items over the past eight months and provided a unique opportunity to lean in on partnerships and expand financial plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He expects 2021 revenue growth to be five times over 2020, while Fuzzy memberships, which start for free and then a monthly subscription of $24.99 or annual subscription for $99.99, have increased through partnerships with retailers and vet groups. Bhettay did not reveal the company’s valuation, but did say it was more than a three-time uptick from the Series B round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Icon Ventures, with existing investors Greycroft, Matrix and Crosscut participating, with additional backing from veterinary clinic groups and individuals, including former Chewy chairman Mark Vadon and Clearlake Group founder Jose Feliciano. In addition, 25% of the capital was raised from underrepresented communities, Bhettay said.</p>

<p>In addition to expanding the vet network — Fuzzy is operational in 25 locations — his plans for the new funding include the development and launch of new product offerings, additional educational content and new member growth.</p>
<p>“We want to see pet care go from once a year to anytime, anywhere,” Bhettay added. “As we think about our vision of becoming the first place where everyone comes to, there are some features and products that we can bring into the business to accelerate that path, as well as acquisitions in the next six to 12 months.”</p>
<p>There are a number of startups tapping into this major trend of pets to capture that household spend in the areas of healthcare, insurance and food. Bhettay is also seeing the larger incumbents focus here, as well as marketing dollars, which he considers validation that the market is shifting to the digitalization of pet care.</p>
<p>Tom Mawhinney, general partner at Icon Ventures, has four dogs himself and felt the pains of having to wait weeks to get them in to see a veterinarian, including having to take one dog to the emergency vet.</p>
<p>He called Bhettay “an energetic and smart entrepreneur” who is building a strong team to go after a space that is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>“The problems are more exacerbated the more pets that are added to the system, which has not grown in a way to support that,” Mawhinney added. “There needs to be new means for providing care to pets, and Fuzzy is putting in place a bespoke wellness plan that is encouraging interaction to become more frequent and make the overall lives of pets better.”</p>
