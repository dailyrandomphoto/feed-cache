										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest bid to outspend the competition on podcasting exclusives, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning announced that it has signed a multi-year deal with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7kz7cRLYAcPiWxqiKw1nlG">Archewell Audio</a>, a new production founded by Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markel, The Duchess of Sussex. Financial details haven’t been disclosed, but given the profile of the names and the cost of previous exclusives, it seems safe to suggest the company paid a pretty penny here.</p>
<p>The first full podcast series is expected to arrive at some point in 2021, and like all Spotify podcasts, will be free for subscribers. Before then, however, Archewell and Spotify-owned Gimlet will release a holiday special co-hosted by the Duke and Duchess. As you’d imagine, that’s set to be released at some point this month. They will continue to both produce and host shows for the duration of the deal.</p>
<p>Here’s what the pair had to say in a joint statement offered to Spotify,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction. With the challenges of 2020, there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each other’s stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify, of course, has been spending hundreds of millions over the past couple of years to build a library of exclusive podcasting content. Last month the music streaming service spent $235 million to buy ad company, Megaphone. Other high-profile acquisitions include Gimlet, The Ringer, Parcast and Anchor. The company also signed controversial host Joe Rogan to a multi-year deal in excess of $100 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last few years, Skylum made a name for itself with a set of photo-editing apps like Aurora HDR and Luminar. With <a href="https://skylum.com/luminar-ai">Luminar AI</a>, it is now launching a brand-new photo editor, starting at $79. The new application, available as a standalone product for Mac and Windows and as a plug-in for Lightroom and Photos for MacOS, was built from the ground up and offers many of the traditional photo-editing features you&#8217;re probably familiar with from the likes of Lightroom. The focus, though, is on its new AI-based tools, with a special focus on editing landscapes (and skies in general) and portrait shoots.</p>
<p>In total, Skylum added 13 AI features to the application. You can use those to improve your composition, replace the sky in your images (and relight the scene accordingly), add fog, mist and haze, and manipulate the faces and bodies of your portrait subjects by simply dragging a few sliders.</p>
<p>The idea here is to make it very easy for beginners to improve their photos while also giving pros the tools to quickly get the results they are looking for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach to AI lines up with that of the best minds in the field. What differentiates it, however, is our human-centric application of this incredibly powerful technology. In my experience, only 30% of our time is actually spent being creative,” said Alex Tsepko, CEO of Skylum. “Luminar AI uses artificial intelligence to flip those metrics. We created Luminar AI so people can focus on the outcomes and photos, and not worry so much about the editing process.”</p>

<p>For beginners, the place to start is Luminar AI&#8217;s templates, which you can think of as very advanced filters that go well beyond what <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is capable of. The application automatically classifies the image to get started (say landscape or portrait) and gives you a list of matching templates. That&#8217;s cool and often a good start, but chances are if you invest in a tool like this, you&#8217;ll want more granular control.</p>
<p>Luminar AI&#8217;s marquee feature is its Sky AI, which lets you replace the sky in your images with a few clicks. To do this, you choose from a set of pre-made skies, including sunsets, or create your own library. Either way, the application can then relight the whole scene based on what that sky looks like. It works surprisingly well. There&#8217;s also an Augmented Sky AI, which is a bit more gimmicky and lets you add birds, planes and balloons to the sky. It&#8217;s not for me, but expect to see a lot of balloons in your favorite influencers&#8217; images in the near future. For more subtle changes, you can opt for the Sky Enhancer AI, which makes your sky pop a little bit more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086862" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086862" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086862" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Old-fashioned-look.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skylum</p></div></p>
<p>For more general editing, the Accent AI tool is quite useful to adjust brightness, contrast and color, while Structure AI brings more clarity to an image.</p>
<p>Skylum promises that those adjustments won&#8217;t look unnatural, but your mileage may vary. Indeed &#8212; and this depends on your personal tastes &#8212; I found that for the best results, only moving the sliders 10 or 20 points was often enough. Anything more and you run the risk of creating some pretty garish images.</p>
<p>The portrait features include Body AI, Iris AI, Face AI and Skin AI. They make it exceedingly easy to perform the kind of retouching operations that would usually take a long time in Photoshop, be that bringing out a subject&#8217;s eyes, whitening teeth or removing blemishes from their skin.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086868" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086868" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086868" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Body-AI.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086868" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skylum</p></div></p>
<p>But while tools to change clouds in your landscapes and add bokeh to your shots are pretty uncontroversial for anybody but the most extreme of photography purists, having tools that can easily slim down anybody&#8217;s body or face with just a few clicks is something else.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t necessarily the place to litigate the ethics of portrait retouching and the toxicity of body shaming on social networks, but it&#8217;s something to be aware of, especially given how easy Luminar AI makes it to retouch bodies and faces and how effective the tool is. For what it&#8217;s worth, I tend to find myself feeling rather queazy using this side of Luminar AI&#8217;s tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tive.co/">Tive</a>, a Boston-based startup, is building a hardware and software platform to help track the conditions of a shipment like say food or medicine to make sure it is stored under the proper conditions as it moves from farm or factory to market. Today, the company announced a $12 million Series A.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rre-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rre-ventures">RRE Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the round with help from new investor Two Sigma Ventures and existing investors NextView Ventures, Hyperplane Ventures, One Way Ventures, Fathom Ventures and other unnamed individuals. The company has now raised close to $17 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tive">Tive <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> helps companies all over the world track their shipments in a very specific way,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Krenar Komoni told me. Using a tracking device the company created, customers can press a button, place the tracker on a palette or in a container, and it begins transmitting shipment data like temperature, shock, light exposure, humidity and location data in real time to ensure that the shipment is moving safely to market under proper conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that they are the first company to create single-use 5G trackers, meaning the shipping company doesn&#8217;t have to worry about managing, maintaining, recharging or returning them (although they encourage that by giving a discount for future orders on returned items).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Tive tracker over computer displaying tracking data software." width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg 1526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-15-at-9.16.35-AM.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087288" class="wp-caption-text">Tive hardware tracker and data tracking software. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Tive</p></div></p>
<p>The approach seems to be working. Komoni reports that revenue has grown 570% in 2020 as the product-market fit has become more acute with digitization hitting the supply chain in a big way. He says that in particular customers and investors like the company&#8217;s full-stack approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting [&#8230;] and why we are resonating with customers and also why investors like it, is because we&#8217;re providing the full stack, meaning the hardware, the software, the platform and the APIs to major transportation management systems,&#8221; Komoni explained.</p>
<p>The company has 22 employees and expects to double that number in 2021. As he grows the company, Komoni says that as an immigrant founder, he&#8217;s particularly sensitive to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an immigrant myself. I grew up in Kosovo, came to the US when I was 17 years old, went to high school here in Vermont. I&#8217;m a US citizen, but part of who I am is being open to different cultures and different nationalities. It&#8217;s just part of my nature,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2015 and its facilities are in Boston. It has continued shipping devices throughout the pandemic, and that has meant figuring out how to operate in a safe way with some employees in the building. He expects the company will have more employees operating out of the office as we move past the pandemic. He also has an engineering operation in Kosovo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kryo, the company behind <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com">the ChiliSleep brand</a>, is announcing that it has merged with another sleep technology company, <a href="https://www.ebbsleep.com">Ebb Therapeutics</a>, and also raised $37 million in new funding led by Ebb&#8217;s biggest investor KKR.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Kryo/ChiliSleep&#8217;s products include <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/products/chilipad-sleep-system">the chiliPAD</a>, a device designed to improve sleep by adjusting the temperature of your bed. Co-founder and CEO Tara Youngblood told me that the company has always been focused on &#8220;changing sleep through temperature regulation&#8221; — but recently, the team has also become &#8220;hungry for this software piece&#8221; that will allow them to reach consumers without hardware.</p>
<p>Ebb, meanwhile, has created <a href="https://www.ebbsleep.com/cart/?add-to-cart=59805">a cooling headband</a> that&#8217;s also supposed to help customers sleep better. Youngblood said that the two companies have &#8220;a complementary approach,&#8221; and that the merger will create a strong portfolio of combined patents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Youngblood also said that moving forward, the company will be led by Kryo management, but she declined to comment further on whether the Ebb team will be part of the merger.</p>
<p>The plan is to launch a new software platform called Sleep.me in May, which will combine sleep-related community, content and coaching (that last piece will draw on Ebb&#8217;s existing coaching service), with free and paid offerings. Youngblood said the company will continue to sell ChiliSleep products as well, while &#8220;the Ebb product line and Ebb brand will probably go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Youngblood acknowledged that there&#8217;s been an explosion in sleep-related products in recent decades — something she attributed to growing research and awareness around the importance of sleep to our health.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going to be different, really, with the platform is that we&#8217;re going talk to that individual&#8221; and offer personalized advice, she said. &#8220;Thermal regulation may be a part of [your personalized approach], or it may not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Youngblood also noted that ChiliSleep has a medical advisory board that includes <a href="https://medicine.arizona.edu/person/michael-grandner-phd-mtr-cbsm-faasm">Dr. Michael Grandner</a> of the University of Arizona, <a href="http://www.cvilleneuroandsleep.com">Dr. Chris Winter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Starrett">Dr. Kelly Starrett</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insomnia and sleep-related issues are unfortunately on the rise, but fortunately so are effective treatments to address them,&#8221; said Ali Satvat, the global head of KKR Health Care Strategic Growth, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to support the merger of ChiliSleep and Ebb to bring these innovations to the market and help solve an unmet need for those who need improved sleep.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">James <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cox-4bc4" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cox-4bc4">Cox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> spent much of his professional career at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> trying to crack the problem of how to reduce congestion through ride-sharing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As one of the architects of the Uber Pool service and a longtime proponent of ride-sharing as a means to slash vehicle emissions, Cox leapt at the chance to harness technology developed at MIT that purported to perfect a dynamic routing and vehicle management system for transit authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That technology is at the heart of <a href="https://theroutingcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theroutingcompany.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608116439869000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbZXxwEUxrf9vUXLq8VjyAmDhDZA">The Routing Company</a>, the startup that Cox now leads. It&#8217;s based on sofrware developed by Routing Company co-founder and chief technology officer, Alex Wallar, when he was a doctoral student at MIT focused on optimizing vehicle distributions. Working with collaborators including Daniela Rus, the director of MIT&#8217;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and post-doc researcher Javier Alonso Mora, Wallar developed a platform that could apply real-time optimization to public transit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">In April, Wallar took the research to Menno van der Zee, and the two men developed the underlying platform that would become The Routing Company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cox came on board as an advisor to the company initially, but decided to join the ride full-time after seeing the technology that Wallar and van der Zee had developed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, with $5 million in new financing led by the MIT deeptech investment fund, <a href="http://www.engine.xyz/">The Engine</a>, and $6.5 million in total financing, the company is taking its tech to transit authorities around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are thrilled to support The Routing Company. They have cracked the code for dynamic shared rides at scale.&#8221; said Reed Sturtevant, general partner of The Engine. &#8220;Smart ride sharing solutions for cities will have a ripple effect. Innovation in transit could quickly reduce congestion, shorten commute times for those who can&#8217;t afford to live in the city where they work, and help the environment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea is to take the services that private companies had been trying to offer to consumers, and bring the benefits to everyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup landscape is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/ford-is-shutting-down-chariot-shuttle-service/#:~:text=Chariot%20will%20end%20service%20on,will%20cease%20by%20February%201.&amp;text=Those%20enterprise%20routes%20in%20Austin,winding%20down%20by%20early%20March.">littered with failed private commuter services</a>, and The Routing Company hopes to circumvent the issues they faced by working with, instead of competing against, public urban transit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the US alone, public transportation is a $74 billion business&#8230; and during the COVID-19 pandemic it&#8217;s a business that&#8217;s suffering greatly.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we and all the other ridesharing companies were building shared rides algorithms in the past.. The complexity in solving the shared rides problem had not been solved in real time,&#8221; said Cox of his time at Uber. &#8220;My understanding was that it was not possible to solve it in real time. We are really making transit a customer. If you look at transit they are very good at working with high capacity routes and demand. Where they’re weaker is in low and medium density areas. This is where there’s really an opportunity to help them.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Cox sees his new company as solving a problem that specifically impacts low-income, low density communities. These areas typically aren&#8217;t serviced as well or as frequently by traditional public transit, and the tools on offer from the Routing Company give transit authorities a way to spin up a new fleet to service those areas.</p>
<p>The Routing Company sells a package that includes an app for riders, an app for drivers, and a fleet management platform for the transit agency. While it experiments with different pricing options, Cox declined to disclose how much the company is charging its initial customers, but the revenue model is based on either a per vehicle, per-month fee or on a percentage of the revenue generated per vehicle, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Each driver receives a link to download an app. The riders are capable of accessing the app in a push a button shuttle way. We have built tools to allow people to make a phone call and make an appointment with an operator,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>The algorithms that had been developed for ride sharing in the past used an individual&#8217;s geolocation and destination to set the parameters of who would pick them up. The Routing Company flips that model by focusing on the position of an entire fleet of vehicles first and their already established routes to determine which vehicle is the best suited to pick up a passenger for a ride.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wait times depend on the city and the number of vehicles deployed through The Routing Company, but Cox said the goal was to have passengers wait no more than 10 minutes for a pick up.  Already, one city in Scotland is using the service and The Routing Company has signed contracts with four undisclosed cities in the US an done in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plenty of people who have tried to make shuttle startups. The issue with a number of those is that the unit economics don’t work. Our approach definitely has the right technology and if we can augment public transit rather than compete with it,&#8221; Cox said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The foldable category got off to a famously rocky start. Fifteen months after the release of the first Galaxy Fold, Samsung has time to work out some of the issues with the original device in a fairly public fashion, given the world the better-received Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold 2 this year.</p>
<p>Likely due to various stumbles from mobile manufacturers, the form factor has yet to redefine the industry in a meaningful way – but meaningful change takes time. And in case there was any doubt surrounding Samsung’s commitment to foldable displays, Mobile President <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/editorial-samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences-with-personalized-tech-tailor-made-for-life-in-2021">TM Roh penned a letter</a> on the company’s site, noting an expansion of the portfolio next year.</p>
<p>Whether that means an additional device or something more meaningful remains to be seen, though it does seem to suggest the arrival of at least one more affordable model. Price has certainly been a major hurdle for the adoption of these products. In the letter Roh notes that he/the company will be “sharing more in January” – perhaps an allusion to CES or a standalone Samsung event. Roh adds,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>True to our heritage of staying ahead of the curve with trailblazing mobile tech, we’ll be expanding our portfolio of foldables, so this groundbreaking category is more accessible to everyone. And while we’re already known for our revolutionary cameras, we’ll never stop trying to outdo ourselves — so be on the lookout for super-intelligent, pro-grade camera and video capabilities in 2021. We’ve also been paying attention to people’s favorite aspects of the Galaxy Note experience and are excited to add some of its most well-loved features to other devices in our lineup.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing particularly earth-shattering. With the race to 5G devices in the rear-view, the focus is seemingly back on cameras, in addition to folding screens. More after the holidays, no doubt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last year, Adobe has quietly continued to expand its tools for helping developers use PDFs in their applications. In April, the company launched a couple of SDKs, for example, which are <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/07/29/adobe-document-services-bring-world-class-pdf-tools-to-your-apps.html#gs.nke2rv">now known</a> as the PDF Embed API and PDF Tools API, and with that update, the company also launched its <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/">Adobe Documents Services</a> platform. The idea here is to provide developers with easy-to-use tools to build PDFs into their applications and workflows. Today, the company is announcing a new partnership with Microsoft that brings Document Services to Power Automate, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> low-code workflow automation platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had this vision about a year and a half back where we said, &#8216;how about bringing the best of what we provide in our own apps to third-party apps as well?&#8217; &#8221; Vibhor Kapoor, Adobe&#8217;s SVP for its Document Cloud business, told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the simple mindset where we said: let&#8217;s decompose the capabilities of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/acrobat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="acrobat">Acrobat <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as microservices [and] as APIs and give it to developers and publishers because frankly, a PDF for developers and publishers has been a pain for lack of a better word. So we brought these services to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team worked to make embedding PDFs into web experiences better, for example (and Kapoor frankly noted that previously, the developer experience had always been &#8220;very suboptimal&#8221; and that the user experience, too, was not always intuitive). Now, with Document Services and the Embed API, it&#8217;s just a matter of a few lines of JavaScript to embed a PDF.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2087105" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087105" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087105" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png" alt="" width="618" height="366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png 618w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pdf_combine.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2087105" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Kapoor acknowledged that exposing these features in SDKs and APIs was a bit of a challenge, simply because the teams didn&#8217;t originally have to worry about this use case. But on top of the technical challenges, this was also a question of changing the overall mindset. &#8220;We never had a very developer-oriented offering in the past and that means that we need to build a team that understands developers, and figure out how we package these APIs and make them available,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The new Power Automate integration brings over 20 new PDF-centric actions from the PDF Tools API to Microsoft&#8217;s platform. These will allow users to do things like create PDFs from documents in a OneDrive folder, for example, covert images to PDFs or apply optical character recognition to PDFs.</p>
<p>Since Adobe launched the platforms, about 6,000 developers have now started using it and Kapoor tells me that he is seeing &#8220;significant growth&#8221; in terms of the number of API calls that are being made. From a business perspective, adding Power Automate will also likely function as a new funnel for getting new developers on board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s only a matter of time now before drones become a key component of everyday logistics infrastructure, but there are still significant barriers between where we are today and that future – particularly when it comes to regulation. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iris-automation-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iris-automation-inc">Iris Automation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is developing computer vision products that can help simplify the regulatory challenges involved in setting standards for pilotless flight, thanks to its detect-and-avoid technology that can run using a wide range of camera hardware. The company has raised a $13 million Series B funding round to improve and extend its tech, and to help provide demonstrations of its efficacy in partnership with regulators.</p>
<p>I spoke to Iris Automation CEO Jon Damush, and Iris Automation investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tess-hatch" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tess-hatch">Tess Hatch, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vp">VP <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bessemer-venture-partners">Bessemer Venture Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about the round and the startup&#8217;s progress and goals. Damush, who took over as CEO earlier this year, talked about his experience at Boeing, his personal experience as a pilot, and the impact on aviation of the advent of small, cheap and readily accessible electric motors, batteries and powerful computing modules, which have set the stage for an explosion in the commercial UAV industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve now shattered some of the barriers that have been in aerospace for the past 50 years, because you&#8217;re starting to really democratize the tools of production that allow people to make things that fly much easier than they could before,&#8221; Damush told me. &#8220;So with that, and the ability to take a human out of the cockpit, comes some interesting challenges – none more so than the regulatory environment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-aviation-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-aviation-administration">Federal Aviation Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (FAA), and most airspace regulators around the world, essentially break regulations around commercial flight down into two spheres, Damush explains. The first is around operations – what are you going to do while in flight, and are you doing that the right way. The second, however, is about the pilot, and that&#8217;s a much trickier thing to adapt to pilotless aircraft.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges is the part of the regulations called 91.113b, and what that part of the regs states is that given weather conditions that permit, it&#8217;s the pilot on the airplane that has the ultimate responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft,&#8221;  That&#8217;s not a separation standard that says you&#8217;ve got to be three miles away, or five miles away or a mile away – that is a last line of defense, that is a safety net, so that when all the other mitigations that lead to a safe flight from A to B fail, the pilot is there to make sure you don&#8217;t collide into somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris comes in here, with an optical camera-based obstacle avoidance system that uses computer vision to effectively replace this last line of defence when there isn&#8217;t a pilot to do so. And what this unlocks is a key limiting factor in today&#8217;s commercial drone regulatory environment: The ability to fly aircraft beyond visual line of sight. All that means is that drones can operate without having to guarantee that an operator has eyes on them at all times. When you first hear that, you imagine that this factors in mostly to long-distance flight, but Damush points out that it&#8217;s actually more about volume – removing the constraints of having to keep a drone within visual line of sight at all times means you can go from having one operator per drone, to one operator managing a fleet of drones, which is when the economies of scale of commercial drone transportation really start to make sense.</p>
<p>Iris has made progress towards making this a reality, working with the FAA this year as part of its integrated pilot program to demonstrate the system in two different use cases. It also released the second version of its Casia system, which can handle significantly longer range object detection. Hatch pointed out that these were key reasons why Bessemer upped its stake with this follow-on investment, and when I asked if COVID-19 has had any impact on industry appetite or confidence in the commercial drone market, she said that has been a significant factor, and it&#8217;s also changing the nature of the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two largest industries [right now] are agriculture and public safety enforcement,&#8221; Hatch told me. &#8220;And public safety enforcement was not one of those last year, it was agriculture, construction and energy. That&#8217;s definitely become a really important vertical for the drone industry – one could imagine someone having a heart attack or an allergic reaction, an ambulance takes on average 14 minutes to get to that person, when a drone can be dispatched and deliver an AED or an epi pen within minutes, saving that person&#8217;s life. So I really hope that tailwind continues post COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Series B round includes investment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bee-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bee-partners">Bee Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> OCA Ventures, and new strategic investors Sony Innovation Fund and Verizon Ventures (disclosure: TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media Group, though we have no involvement, direct or otherwise, with their venture arm). Damush pointed out that Sony provides great potential strategic value because it develops so much of the imaging sensor stack used in the drone industry, and Sony also develops drones itself. For its part, Verizon offers key partner potential on the connectivity front, which is invaluable for managing large-scale drone operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has completed its 17th mission, putting a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite on orbit for client <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/synspective-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="synspective-inc">Synspective, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Tokyo-based space startup that has raised over $100 million in funding to date. Syspective aims to operate a 30-satellite constellation that can provide global imaging coverage of Earth, with SAR&#8217;s benefits of being able to see through clouds and inclement weather, as well as in all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>This is Synspective&#8217;s first satellite on orbit, and it took off from Rocket Lab&#8217;s launch facility on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. It will operate in a sun synchronous orbit approximately 300,000 miles from Earth, and will act a a demonstrator of the startup&#8217;s technology to pave the way for the full constellation, which will provide commercially available SAR data avails both raw, and processed via the company&#8217;s in-development AI technology to provide analytics and insights.</p>
<p>For Rocket Lab, this marks the conclusion of a successful year in launch operations, which also saw the company take its key <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">first steps towards making its Electron launch system partially reusable</a>. The company did have one significant setback as well, with a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/04/rocket-lab-launch-fails-during-rockets-second-stage-burn-causing-a-loss-of-vehicle-and-payloads/"> mission that failed to deliver its payloads to orbit in July</a>, but the company quickly bounced back from that failure with improvements to prevent a similar incident in future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In 2021, Rocket Lab will aim to launch its first mission from the U.S., using its new launch facility at Wallops Island, in Virginia. That initial U.S. flight was supposed to happen in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a NASA certification process for one of its systems, pushed the launch to next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/refreshing-our-policies-to-support-community-well-being">announced</a> a new set of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en">Community Guidelines</a> that aim to strengthen its existing policies in areas like harassment, dangerous acts, self-harm and violence, alongside the introduction of four new features similarly focused on the community&#8217;s well-being. These include updated resources for those struggling with self-harm or suicide, opt-in viewing screens that hide distressing content, a text-to-voice feature to make TikTok more accessible and an expanded set of COVID-19-related resources.</p>
<p>While many of the topics were already covered by TikTok&#8217;s Community Guidelines ahead of today&#8217;s changes, the company said the updates add more specifics to each of the areas based on what behavior it&#8217;s seen on the platform, heard through community feedback and received via input from experts such as academics, civil society organizations and TikTok&#8217;s own Content Advisory Council.</p>
<p>One update is to the guidelines related to suicide and self-harm, which have now incorporated feedback and language used by mental health experts to avoid normalizing self-injury behaviors. Specifically, TikTok&#8217;s policy on eating disorder content has added considerations aimed at prohibiting the normalization of or the glorification of dangerous weight loss behaviors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2086947" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086947" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?w=391" alt="" width="391" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png 808w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=768,1334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=391,680 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tips-and-Support.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Stronger policies on bullying and harassment now further detail the types of content and behaviors that aren&#8217;t welcome on TikTok, including doxxing, cyberstalking and a more extensive policy on sexual harassment. This one is particularly interesting, given that there have been some cases of TikTok users figuring out where anti-masker nurses worked &#8212; and at least <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/oregon-nurse-placed-on-leave-over-anti-mask-covid-19-tiktok.html">one incident led to the nurse being put on leave</a>. It&#8217;s unclear how TikTok will approach this sort of &#8220;doxxing&#8221; behavior, however, as it didn&#8217;t involve publishing a home address &#8212; only alerting an employer.</p>
<p>Another update expanded the guidelines around TikTok&#8217;s dangerous acts policy to more explicitly limit, label or remove content depicting dangerous acts and challenges. Through a new &#8220;harmful activities&#8221; section to the minor safety policy, TikTok reiterates that content promoting dangerous dares, games and other acts that may jeopardize the safety of youth is prohibited.</p>
<p>TikTok also updated its policy around dangerous individuals and organizations to focus on the issue of violent extremism. The new guidelines now describe in greater detail what&#8217;s considered a threat or incitement to violence, as well as the content that will be prohibited. This one is timely, too, as many Trump supporters have been pushing for a new civil war or other violence as a result of Trump losing the U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>In terms of new features, TikTok worked with behavioral psychologists and suicide prevention experts &#8212; including <a href="https://www.providence.org/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.providence.org/en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2Ghej2gRlOM8_Hel95vzkHeDr3w">Providence</a>, <a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw">Samarita<wbr></wbr>ns</a><a href="https://samaritanshope.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://samaritanshope.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa3So6LwR4KgxqsSGDv2hMqkZ7qw"> of Singapore</a> and members of its U.S. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5GwrqBOL67DLDSZ4wr4NkSDnGtw">Content Advisory Council</a> &#8212; to create new resources that include evidence-based actions users can take for searches related to self-harm. These new resources will appear when users search for terms like &#8220;selfharm&#8221; or &#8220;hatemyself.&#8221; Access to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line will continue to be available for emergency support, as before.</p>
<p>TikTok will also introduce new opt-in viewing screens that will appear on top of videos of content some may find graphic or distressing. These videos are already ineligible for the For You feed, but may not be prohibited. For example, the screens might cover violence or fighting that&#8217;s not being removed due to documentary reasons; animals in nature doing something some find upsetting &#8212; like hunting and killing their prey; or otherwise scary stuff, like horror clips.</p>
<p>When TikTok becomes aware of this disturbing content through user flagging, it will apply the screens to the videos to reduce unwanted viewing. Users who then come across the video can either tap the button at the bottom of the screen to &#8220;skip video&#8221; or the other to &#8220;watch anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, a new text-to-voice feature, aimed at accessibility, allows people to convert their typed text to a voice that plays over it in a video. This follows TikTok&#8217;s recent launch of a feature to support people with <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFalF2i7rrcKRjmgyUgRKoGL6PQMg">photosensitive epilepsy.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086945" style="width: 353px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086945" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2086945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?w=343" alt="" width="343" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=151,300 151w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=768,1523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=343,680 343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=774,1536 774w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=1032,2048 1032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Text-to-speech.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok is also adding questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines to its in-app coronavirus resource hub. These will be provided by public health experts, like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, and will be linked to from the Discover page, search results and via banners on COVID-19 and vaccine-related videos. The company says its COVID-19 hub has already been viewed more than 2 billion times in the last six months. TikTok is partnering with <a href="https://teamhalo.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamhalo.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608059290014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGTpSMEEisQvuEk3aMJhFOE6Cm5w">Team Halo</a> as well, so scientists all over the world can share the progress being made on the vaccine through video updates.</p>
<p>TikTok has been fairly aggressive about moderating content on its platform. If you scroll through the feed long enough, you&#8217;ll find users lamenting about videos of theirs that were taken down for policy violations. You&#8217;ll also come across videos where users have reuploaded another person&#8217;s deleted video in order to respond to it. It even quickly addressed much of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">the election misinformation</a> that was being spread in November by blocking top hashtags, like #RiggedElection and #SharpieGate.</p>
<p>Its new policies out today also include changes that address what&#8217;s been more recent user behavior, like the calls for violence following the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping our community safe is a commitment with no finish line,&#8221; said TikTok, in its announcement today about its updates. &#8220;We recognize the responsibility we have to our users to be nimble in our detection and response when new kinds of content and behaviors emerge. To that end, we&#8217;ll keep advancing our policies, developing technology to automatically detect violative content, building features that help people manage their TikTok presence and content choices, and empowering our community to help us foster a trustworthy environment. Ultimately, we hope these updates enable people to have a positive and meaningful TikTok experience,&#8221; the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today is launching a way for customers to create custom clothing with a new service called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/amazonmadeforyou">Made for You</a>, which lets shoppers create a custom T-shirt to their exact measurements. But unlike some companies that <a href="https://www.mtailor.com/how-it-works.html">use mobile technology to scan and measure</a> your body from an app, Amazon Fashion&#8217;s Made for You service requires users to provide the company with their height, weight, body style, and two photos of themselves to get measured for their custom fit.</p>
<p>After users provide their data, they can then choose from a selection of eight different colorways, as well as preferred sleeve and shirt lengths, necklines and fabrics.</p>
<p>To get started with Made for You, users choose between the two types of fabrics to customize the design. This includes either the Medium-weight 100% Pima Cotton shirt or the Lightweight 56% Pima Cotton, 38% Modal, and 6% Elastane tri-blend options. They can then choose other aspects of their shirt &#8212; like either a slim, classic or relaxed fit, a crew or V-neck, and short or long sleeve length, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The shirts can even include your name printed on the label, as a small perk.</p>
<p>When finished, customers can view the product they customized on a virtual body double before placing the order. The experience works both on web and inside the Amazon app.</p>
<p>The custom shirts cost $25 are available to all Amazon customers in the U.S., not just Prime members.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2087075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png 828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Made-for-You-CX-3-Red-Shirt-.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>At launch, influencers including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakescott/?hl=en">Blake Scott</a> (650K followers on Instagram), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caralynmirand/?hl=en">Caralyn Mirand</a> (253K Instagram followers), and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scoutthecity/?hl=en">Sai de Silva</a> (330K Instagram followers) are touting the new feature on Amazon&#8217;s behalf and are featured in its marketing.</p>
<p>Custom clothing is often seen as a luxury and this process does make it more affordable. That can be helpful for those who struggle with fit due to measurements that fall outside of traditional sizing. But the service also seems to be a pretty transparent attempt to grab customer data for the Amazon Fashion business.</p>
<p>Amazon, however, characterizes Made for You as part of its ongoing efforts to eliminate online shopping challenges &#8212; this time, size and fit. Over time, the company says it wants to expand Made for You with more styles and selection, based on customer feedback.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The retailer has been focused on its fashion business for years, having <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/04/27/68516/amazons-echo-look-rates-your-outfits-and-slurps-up-revealing-data/">experimented in the past</a> with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/29/how-echo-look-could-feed-amazons-big-data-fueled-fashion-ambitions/">Echo Look camera</a> that would help users rate their styling choices. Today, Amazon uses data from its social feature, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/finds/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_ggwhead_9a1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0HGYNCMMYWB7VAAG78C9&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=98c55ba7-fb82-44d8-b396-63413e7f5172&amp;pf_rd_i=19419848011">#FoundItOnAmazon</a> to feed images to &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=19419848011">Style by Alexa</a>&#8221; for fashion inspiration and to drive sales. And with Prime Wardrobe and its optional styling service, Amazon attempts to learn what its customers like to wear and then automate the shopping process by curating items to try on at home in batches.</p>
<p>Though Amazon didn&#8217;t explain how it may put the collected data to use to aid its Amazon Fashion business beyond custom clothing, it did say the data was securely stored and customers could delete their data at any time by tapping the profile icon at the top left of the Made for You home page. Amazon also says the uploaded photos aren&#8217;t stored and are deleted immediately after being used to create the virtual body double and determine measurements.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s goal with all these efforts is to improve online apparel shopping, it could potentially extend to other areas &#8212; for example, by helping Amazon build out its <a href="https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Amazon-fashion-fostering-over-100-private-label-brands,1156429.html">dozens of private labels</a> in apparel. And with the added data on real-world customer sizing, the retailer could learn how to better cut its clothing for the best fit. It could even be working on systems that could later help customers select their right size just from a photo, perhaps.</p>
<p>Made for You is launching today in the U.S. across web and mobile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after it raised a $15 million Series B, <a href="https://public.com/">Public</a>, a social-focused free stock trading service, has raised a $65 million Series C.</p>
<p>The startup is not the only company to raise successive rounds this year. Welcome has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">managed the feat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">along with Skyflow</a> and others. Public&#8217;s Series C, therefore, fits into the trend of investors doubling down into startups that they think have potential.</p>
<p>After an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">initial freeze during the early pandemic months</a>, venture capitalists and other investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/3-investors-discuss-the-state-of-saas-investing-in-2020/">accelerated the pace</a> at which they deploy late-stage checks to upstart companies. Public&#8217;s Series C typifies the tendency, representing just over 72% of its total fundraising to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Public round also exemplifies another developing venture trend, namely that of existing investors preempting portfolio companies&#8217; proximate rounds. In this case <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the new investment. It also led Public&#8217;s Series A and B rounds.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vDByipQZZN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">Skyflow raises $17.5M more to help companies protect your personal data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Skyflow raises $17.5M more to help companies protect your personal data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/embed/#?secret=vDByipQZZN" data-secret="vDByipQZZN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But trends alone are not enough to pull any round together. So, TechCrunch got on the phone with Public co-founders Jannick Malling and Leif Abraham to better understand what investors see in the fintech upstart.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>Public grew quickly in 2020, expanding its user base by a multiple of 10 since the start of the year.</p>
<p>According to Abraham, the company&#8217;s growth has been consistent instead of lumpy, expanding at around 30% each month. The co-founder also stressed that most of Public&#8217;s users find its service organically, implying that the startup&#8217;s marketing costs have not been extreme, nor its growth artificially boosted.</p>
<p>That user growth explains why Public was able to raise more. But why did it want to?</p>
<p>The founding duo told TechCrunch that they had plenty of cash in the bank from their preceding round, but saw the raise as a way to double-down on their model.</p>
<p>While competing services to Public also sport zero-cost trading, Public&#8217;s model hinges on a social focus (TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">covered an element of Public&#8217;s social platform here</a>, for example). And in the eyes of its founders, Public gets better as more people use it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yDK7YXVZDt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/">As investing apps boom, Public doubles down on its social focus</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As investing apps boom, Public doubles down on its social focus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/embed/#?secret=yDK7YXVZDt" data-secret="yDK7YXVZDt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So, the startup intends to use its new capital to continue investing into product work, keeping its flywheel alive.</p>
<p>That self-reinforcing dynamic works something like this: Public offers a place where investors can discuss and execute trades for free. Those same investors tell their friends about Public, who later show up and take part in the conversation. Those conversations are enriched by the new participants &#8212; as Public deals with securities, it only has users who have registered as themselves, limiting trolling &#8212; and the process repeats.</p>
<p>So far it has worked. How much longer Public and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robinhood">Robinhood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and M1 and Wealthfront and others can continue to accrete net-new investors to their platforms is an open question, however.</p>
<h2>Revenue?</h2>
<p>Astute readers will note that we discussed Public&#8217;s growth in the above paragraphs only from a user perspective. What about revenue?</p>
<p>Like other companies that offer free stock trades, Public makes money from what&#8217;s called payment for order flow. It&#8217;s the routing of trades to different market makers. Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">generates oceans of income</a> from the practice, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="km3bf1qhZA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">With a 2021 IPO in the cards, what do we know about Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a 2021 IPO in the cards, what do we know about Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/embed/#?secret=km3bf1qhZA" data-secret="km3bf1qhZA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Before chatting with Public, I dug into its <a href="http://public.s3.com/rule606/apex/">trading partner Apex&#8217;s filings</a> to learn about its payment for order flow results from its recent filings. The resulting sums are somewhat modest for Apex&#8217;s collected clients. This means that Public&#8217;s revenue metrics, a portion of the aggregate sums, are even more unassuming.</p>
<p>Naturally, we were curious if the company had changed up its business model and thus had revenues heading into its new investment that we could not spot from external documentation. The founding team told TechCrunch that it had not changed its model, and that their company is more focused on user growth than near-term revenue targets.</p>
<p>This makes some sense. Public emphasized to TechCrunch that most of its users are long-term holders. The longer a user holds securities, the less they likely trade. That limits <em>trading</em> incomes like payment for order flow. So, trading likely won&#8217;t make a lot of money for the company.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s monetization plans remain opaque. This means that the company&#8217;s new check will not only fund its product work in terms of its social experience, but also, we presume, its future revenue generation.</p>
<p>You can look around the fintech market and find examples of ways that Public could further monetize its user base.</p>
<p>This is not to say that revenue at Public has not grown. It has. I asked the company if trading volume <em>generally</em> scales with user growth. It&#8217;s correlated, the founders said. So, we can infer that the company&#8217;s growing user base has executed more trades over time, as a whole.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what Public builds next, and how soon we get a taste for its future plans for generating ample top line from its users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is not a review of the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E Sport SUV.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I spent two short hours in Ford&#8217;s upcoming EV. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable declaring a conclusion with just a couple of hours behind the wheel. I need more time with the Mach-E, and after Ford reads this article, I&#8217;ll probably be last in line for long-term tests.</p>
<p>During my short time with the Mach-E, one thing became clear: The Mach-E should not be called a Mustang, and it should not be called an SUV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By calling the Mach-E a Mustang SUV, Ford is selling buyers an experience not found in the Mach-E. This isn&#8217;t a fight over semantics. The Mach-E isn&#8217;t a sporty SUV in a traditional manner. For that, look at the Audi E-Tron Sportback or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Model X. Those offer several key characteristics missing from the Mach-E SUV. They&#8217;re sturdy, stout and powerful, whereas the Mach-E feels small, loose and sloppy.</p>
<p>There are several areas of concern. I found the vehicle dynamics questionable. The throttle is nauseating, and the rear end has a hard time keeping traction. The range is poor compared to competitors; the AWD version gets 50 miles less than a comparable Tesla. And what&#8217;s more important in an electric vehicle than driving characteristics and electric range?</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2079337,2079341,2079330,2079339,2079338,2079336,2079335,2079332,2079334,2079340"]</p>
<h2>Early impressions</h2>
<p>A few weeks back I took a 2021 Mustang Mach-E AWD around a familiar route in lower Michigan. Every auto journalist knows this area by Hell, Michigan. Despite the name, it&#8217;s a lovely area with old-growth hardwoods lining gentle winding roads where cars can breathe. And for fun, turn off the main road for a bit of dipping and diving on gravel roads. This area was not kind to the Mach-E.</p>
<p>The test was short, but I was still left with several impressions.</p>
<p>The Mach-E bumbles around like an economy crossover. There&#8217;s nothing confident or reassuring about the ride or handling. Even with the Mustang name, the Mach-E doesn&#8217;t drive like a Mustang (hold your jokes; the latest Mustangs are fantastic). The Mach-E isn&#8217;t a car that can be thrown into a corner and expect to emerge safely. The body rolls, rear tires break loose and you lose respect for the Mustang name.</p>
<p>The throttle is touchy and over-expressive. Tap the peddle and Mach-E leaps forward. Combined with aggressive regenerative braking, the Mach-E takes some getting used to. I found the powertrain nauseating. Electric vehicles are an exercise in finesse. The electric motors need to provide power in a smooth, predictable fashion that&#8217;s exciting and confident without being overbearing. It&#8217;s a hard formula and something that few automakers have gotten right the first time.</p>
<p>I was immediately taken aback by the AWD Mach-E&#8217;s poor handling. Most modern EVs drive so well they&#8217;re boring. Not the Mach-E. The rear end is too lively for a pedestrian-vehicle, and not in a sporty manner. This is just sloppy and nauseating. The tires easily break free on everyday turns. Press down on the accelerator, turn the wheel and the vehicle often has to engage traction control to keep the rear wheels from spinning.</p>
<p>By insisting on marketing the Mach-E as sporty, Ford set the expectations on the capability outside of its technical ability. Things get loose when the driver leans into the performance aspects of the Mach-E. During my time with the Mach-E, there were several times I was rounding a normal corner and the back tires became unpredictable or took the car too wide. This is exaggerated with additional speed. I&#8217;m curious how the AWD system handles snow and ice. Several times during my test drive it struggled on gravel.</p>
<p>I later asked a Ford engineer about the tremendous amount of oversteer, and he replied, &#8220;Yeah, only if you drive it that way.&#8221; That stuck with me because I don&#8217;t think it was my fault. I don&#8217;t think I was driving the Mach-E around Ann Arbor, Michigan in an aggressive fashion, but even still, the roads were dry, and the traction control kicked on several times during my short drive. That shouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>The Mach-E performs better in a straight line. The acceleration is quick. With the go-pedal mashed to the floor, the Mach-E rears on its back legs and jumps forward with enthusiasm. Is it quicker than a Tesla? No, but it&#8217;s still quicker than most vehicles in its price range and plenty fast enough to speed away from a stop light.</p>
<p>The Mach-E has three driving modes. In the standard and economy mode, the throttle delivers power in a more refined method than the performance mode, which seems messy and crude. All three modes offer one-peddle driving through aggressive regenerative braking.</p>
<p>The electric range is another factor to consider with the Mach-E. The AWD version tops out at an EPA-estimated 270 miles compared to the 326 miles found in Tesla&#8217;s AWD Model Y. The RWD-only version of the Mach-E tops out at 300 miles per charge.</p>
<p>With such a short test, I&#8217;m unable to dive deep into the real-world battery range of the Mach-E. I need to live with the car and use it for a variety of tasks, both around town and long distance. All I can report is the results from my 2 hour drive: I average 2.7 miles to kilowatt-hour, I returned it with 112 miles remaining on the battery, which the vehicle says is 56%. I was driving the AWD model with the extended range battery. The EPA and Ford says this version is good for 270 miles per charge.</p>
<p>The Mach-E&#8217;s pricing is competitive with a starting price of $42,895. The AWD, extended-range version starts at $54,700 and heads north depending on options. Most U.S. buyers are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The Tesla Model 3 starts at $37,990. The long-range, AWD Model 3 that starts at $46,990; the Model Y crossover costs $49,990.</p>
<div data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Competitors have downsides, too. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are novel vehicles with class-leading range, but they&#8217;re not without flaws, including questionable build quality. Other vehicles like the Polestar 2 are fantastic but have less electric range and a higher starting price of $59,900.</div>

<p>The Mach-E&#8217;s interior is fantastic, and that was not a surprise. Ford builds some of the nicest interiors in its class, and the inside of the Mach-E is lovely.</p>
<p>Like most EVs, Ford took great steps to replace traditional automotive components with modern equivalents. Instead of a gauge cluster, a small, narrow LCD screen sits in front of the driver. It&#8217;s classy and efficient. A large LCD screen sits in the center stack for media playback and climate controls. A rotating knob is glued onto the screen at the bottom and provides physical volume control. I really like the volume knob.</p>

<p>The seats seem fine. I was only in them for two hours.</p>
<p>The inside is a bit cramped, but it&#8217;s acceptable for a small crossover. The driver sits in a commanding position, which could be the reason for the SUV designation. Two adults can sit in the back for a cross-town jaunt, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to sit back there for an extended amount of time, as legroom is lacking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m frustrated about the vehicle&#8217;s dynamics, which overshadow fun features found within the Mach-E. Owners can use their smartphone as a key and preprogram navigation routes through a robust road-trip app. The doors are operated by a button, allowing for a cleaner exterior. Ford is even adding hands-free driving through an over-the-air-update, too. But these items hardly matters. Who cares if the cake&#8217;s pretty if it tastes like sadness?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>My first impressions of the Mach-E are poor, and I went into this short test with excited optimism. For me, this Ford Mach-E was supposed to bring the joy of electric vehicles to the masses through a familiar nameplate and legacy manufacturer. I&#8217;m a Ford guy who lives in Michigan and looks at the Mach-E development with local pride. I&#8217;m disappointed.</p>
<p>Right now, based on first impressions, I can only recommend shoppers try competitors before buying the Ford Mustang Mach-E. I don&#8217;t think this vehicle is good enough to buy over a Tesla.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup hailing from far-flung Iceland is emerging as one of the key players in the race to distribute one of the key Coronavirus vaccines around the world. <a href="https://controlant.com/">Controlant</a> — which has a unique real-time supply chain monitoring technology based on GSM networks and is specifically geared to areas like pharmaceuticals and life sciences —  has confirmed it is providing its monitoring services to Pfizer as it delivers the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine globally. The Controlant platform involves screen-based IoT tags which-link to GSM networks and then feed into web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Last week the Governor of New York held up a box (see image above and video below) containing the vaccine, with an unidentified tag that looked like a Controlant GSM tracking device. TechCrunch contacted Controllant and the company confirmed that it was indeed their technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086846" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086846" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png" alt="Controlant Cold Chain as a Service Solution" width="720" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-2086846" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Controlant-Cold-Chain-as-a-Service-Solution.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086846" class="wp-caption-text">Controlant Cold Chain as a Service Solution</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In September Controlant secured $15 million in Series B funding to drive the market expansion of its real-time &#8216;Cold Chain as a Service&#8217; platform. It has largely Iceland-based investors including <a href="http://sjova.is">Sjova</a> and <a href="http://vis.is">VIS</a>. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/frumtak">Frumtak</a>, a VC firm in Iceland, first invested in Controlant in 2011. The recent financing brought Controlant’s total funding to date to $50 million. Frumtak recently sold 11% of its stake in Controlant (a transaction handled by <a href="https://www.arionbanki.is/english/">Arion Bank</a>) for close to $14 million, but will continue to hold a 13% stake through its Frumtak II fund.</p>
<p>In addition to the visibility and monitoring solutions that Controlant is providing to Pfizer, it’s also working directly with the U.S. Government, the CDC, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and stakeholders in &#8216;Operation Warp Speed&#8217;. The platform is being used throughout the entirety of the U.S. supply chain journey of the vaccines.</p>

<p>Gisli Herjolfsson (pictured), co-founder and CEO of Controlant, said in a statement: &#8220;Controlant has amassed a depth of expertise in vaccine supply chain operations and we are happy to have the opportunity to apply our solutions to the entirety of the mRNA-based Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine supply chain, through our direct work with  Pfizer and government stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Controlant IoT devices, packed with the vaccines, capture environmental information, including time, temperature, and light events, and send the information, in real-time, to Controlant’s proprietary platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has issued <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with a fine of €450,000 (~$547k) for failing to promptly declare and properly document a data breach under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The decision is noteworthy as it&#8217;s the first such cross-border <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> decision by the Irish watchdog, which is the lead EU privacy supervisor for a number of tech giants &#8212; having a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">backlog</a> of some 20+ ongoing cases at this point, including active probes of Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple and LinkedIn, to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DPC’s investigation commenced in January, 2019 following receipt of a breach notification from Twitter and the DPC has found that Twitter infringed Article 33(1) and 33(5) of the GDPR in terms of a failure to notify the breach on time to the DPC and a failure to adequately document the breach. The DPC has imposed an administrative fine of €450,000 on Twitter as an effective, proportionate and dissuasive measure,&#8221; the regulator writes in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The GDPR requires most breaches of personal data to be notified to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of the controller becoming aware of the breach.</p>
<p>The regulation also requires they document what data was involved and how they&#8217;ve responded to the security incident &#8212; in order that the relevant data supervisor can check against compliance.</p>
<p>In this case Twitter was found to have failed on both counts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the social media company for comment, including asking whether it plans to accept the decision and pay up &#8212; or if it&#8217;s considering its legal options.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Twitter has now sent this statement, attributed to Damien Kieran, its chief privacy officer and global data protection officer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter worked closely with the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to support their investigation. We have a shared commitment to online security and privacy, and we respect the IDPC’s decision, which relates to a failure in our incident response process. An unanticipated consequence of staffing between Christmas Day 2018 and New Years’ Day resulted in Twitter notifying the IDPC outside of the 72 hour statutory notice period. We have made changes so that all incidents following this have been reported to the DPC in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>We take responsibility for this mistake and remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and data of our customers, including through our work to quickly and transparently inform the public of issues that occur. We appreciate the clarity this decision brings for companies and consumers around the GDPR’s breach notification requirements. Our approach to these incidents will remain one of transparency and openness.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company also told us that since this specific incident, where inadequate staffing over the 2018 holiday period led to a delay in reporting the breach, it has made all relevant incident reports to the DPC within the required 72 hour period.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision relates to a breach that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/twitter-bug-revealed-some-android-users-private-tweets/">publicly disclosed in January 2019</a> &#8212; when it said a bug in its ‘Protect your tweets’ feature could have meant some Android users who’d applied the setting to make their tweets non-public may have had their data exposed to the public Internet since as far back as 2014. (Though GPDR would only apply to data the bug exposed since May 2018.)</p>
<p>Since fessing up to the &#8216;Protect your tweets&#8217; bug, Twitter has had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/twitter-says-some-business-users-had-their-pivate-data-exposed/">plenty more egg on its face</a> where security is concerned &#8212; including suffering a high profile account hijacking episode <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-accounts-hacked-crypto-scam/">earlier this year</a>, after crypto-scam-spreading hackers gained network access credentials using a social engineering technique.</p>

<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC, meanwhile, continues to face criticism for the length of time it&#8217;s taking to reach decisions on major cross-border GDPR cases where impacts on individual rights can scale to hundreds of millions of European Internet users.</p>
<p>Last year commissioner Helen Dixon said its first major GDPR decisions would come &#8220;early&#8221; in 2020.</p>
<p>In the event the first cross-border decision has crossed the line days before the end of the year &#8212; underlining the challenges for the bloc in effectively enforcing its digital rulebook against tech giants. (GDPR technically begun being applied in May 2018, although platform giants have faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">precious little enforcement to date</a>.)</p>
<p>In this specific case, some half a year extra was added to the decision timeline after a draft outcome Ireland submitted to other EU DPAs for review, back in May, was not accepted by all of them &#8212; triggering a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/twitter-could-face-its-first-gdpr-penalty-within-days/">majority vote mechanism</a> in the GDPR for settling disagreement between the bloc&#8217;s data supervisors.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has published this Article 65 decision and the full final decision <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/consistency-findings/binding-decisions_en">on its website here</a>.</p>
<p>The (now) final outcome on the Twitter case comes at a key time &#8212; with EU lawmakers due to set out their next major pieces of digital policy later today, as part of an ambitious push to accelerate regional digitization by rolling out a reassuring promise of European guardrails wrapping around all this tech.</p>
<p>Yet with GDPR enforcement proving such a tedious, friction-filled process that threatens to take the shine off the nascent Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act many months (or even years) before they can become EU law &#8212; raising questions about how the whole strategy can be expected to function in the absence of effective (i.e. fair but fast) enforcement.</p>
<p>The wider risk here is European citizens losing faith in the rights-based framework they&#8217;re told they enjoy, under EU law and the bloc&#8217;s patchwork of regulatory frameworks, if the animal turns out to be such a plodding house-cat when people do try to obtain relief.</p>
<p>So the Commission&#8217;s strategy of claiming expanded digital rules will act as a public trust booster risks falling into a trough of disillusionment at the legislative proposal stage.</p>
<p>Simple put: You can&#8217;t allow your regulators to move so slowly and expect your rulebook to touch tech giants whose playbook is to move fast in order to disrupt the rule of law in their own business&#8217; interests.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision in the Twitter case is thus a measure of how sizeable a gap sits between the rhetoric EU policymakers ply around the bloc&#8217;s &#8216;powerful&#8217; digital rules &#8212; and the messier and more faltering reality: Nearly two years since Twitter disclosed the breach and waiting for a hammer to drop in what should be a relatively straightforward case.</p>
<p>A data breach is not an investigation into the lawfulness of Facebook&#8217;s business model vs GDPR, after all, nor does it delve into the intricacies of Google&#8217;s adtech &#8212; both of which are still open case files on the DPC&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The penalty itself is also a fraction (a little over 0.1%) of Twitter&#8217;s full-year 2019 revenue; a far cry from the up to 4% of global annual turnover maximum allowed for under the GDPR (or the up to 2% max for the specific infringements involved in the breach case).</p>
<p>The size of the fine calculated by Ireland was one of the objections raised by other EU DPAs during the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_bindingdecision01_2020_en.pdf">dispute of the draft decision</a> &#8212; the DPC initially proposed an <em>even smaller fine</em> (in the range of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">0.005% and 0.01% of Twitter&#8217;s annual turnover; or between €</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">135k and €275k). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Article 65 intervention forced Ireland to increase the size of the penalty (though not by much), with the EDPB issuing a binding requirement that Ireland reassess the calculation &#8220;</span>so as to ensure it is appropriate to the facts of the case&#8221;. (It did not specify how large an increase would be required.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the DPC for comment.</p>

<p>EU DPAs also disagreed on the controller/processor status of Twitter&#8217;s Irish business vs its US entity &#8212; with Ireland accepting Twitter Ireland as the data controller and Twitter Inc as the processor, a designation that seems intended to reduce its liability.</p>
<p>So this first cross-border GDPR decision looks more millstone than milestone for the Commission, at the fag end of 2020.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot for commissioners to celebrate here, even though they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">suggested in the summer</a> that the best answer to GDPR enforcement concerns would be for Ireland to get a decision out. The problem now is the black marks against the bloc&#8217;s record on digital enforcement look stubbornly set in &#8212; just as the Commission is laying out a plan to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/">all in on platform regulation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Accessing and sharing data is a complicated issue for large businesses, and doing this in a secure, compliant way is a problem for many. <a href="http://www.exate.com">eXate</a>, a London-based data software firm is attacking this problem and has now raised a £2.3 million seed round led by Outward VC, with additional backing from ING Ventures and Triple Point Ventures.</p>
<p>eXate is competing with those that tend to do more specific types of data privacy such as  Hazy, Privitar, and Very Good Security. By contrast, eXate says it aggregates multiple types of privacy into one solution, and provides central governance and control.</p>
<p>eXate was founded by Peter Lancos and Sonal Rattan, former digital business leaders at HSBC. Its clients include ING, its new investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Peter Lancos, CEO, eXate, said in a statement: “Organisations that store and process large volumes of data experience many challenges when it comes to data sharing. We see the biggest obstacles arise from the lack of joined-up thinking.  The use of expensive multiple single-point solutions, coupled with monitoring complicated country-by-country policies adds time and budget to data initiatives.”</p>
<p>The funding will enable eXate to capitalize on DataSecOps demand by growing its team, accelerating platform development and expanding into new geographies and verticals.</p>
<p>Andi Kazeroonian, Investor at Outward VC, commented on the investment: “Ensuring the protection of sensitive data is a mission-critical challenge for companies that wish to utilise data to deliver value to its stakeholders. eXate’s unique platform provides companies with the tools it requires to ensure data privacy and protection by design.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/">Taxdoo</a>, a startup that has built what it calls an &#8220;automated platform for financial compliance&#8221; aimed at cross-border e-commerce companies, has raised  $21 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Leading the Series A round is venture capital firm Accel, with participation from Visionaries Club, 20VC and existing investor HTGF. The funding will be invested in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/taxdoo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="taxdoo">Taxdoo’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> growth &#8212; including international expansion&#8211; increased hiring, R&amp;D, sales, and customer support. Accel’s Harry Nelis has joined the Taxdoo board.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Harry Stebbings’ 20VC is noteworthy, as the podcaster-turned-VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/from-twenty-minute-vc-to-20vc-harry-stebbings-launched-a-micro-vc-off-the-back-of-his-popular-podcast/">originally said</a> his micro fund was targeting U.S. startups across various stages, and therefore there wasn’t any perceived conflict with his role as a partner at European VC Stride. Taxdoo is based out of Hamburg, Germany. “20VC essentially invests largely in the U.S. but can also invest where Stride does not, anywhere in Europe outside of the U.K. and Paris,” clarified Stebbings in a WhatsApp message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in May 2016, after its three founders &#8212; Christian Koenigsheim, Matthias Allmendinger, and Roger Gothmann &#8212; finished their PhDs in finance at the University of Hamburg, Taxdoo wants to use automation to meet the tax and compliance burden faced by cross-border e-commerce companies that sell on various marketplaces and platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Shopify. This sees those businesses facing increasing complexity around VAT, accounting and other compliance requirements, with data siloed across multiple online systems.</p>
<p>Taxdoo brings that data into a single place and then uses its own tech to automate transaction-level data ingestion, tax calculation and filings across Europe. Customers can also collaborate with their tax advisors through the platform and reduce other compliance burdens, including Intrastat filings.</p>
<p>“While it has become easier and easier to sell products across borders in Europe from a marketing and logistics standpoint, the resulting compliance obligations – like accounting or VAT – are a nightmare for sellers,” Taxdoo’s Christian Koenigsheim tells me.</p>
<p>“Handling these issues manually using spreadsheets is a recipe for disaster. To solve this problem, we&#8217;ve used our in-house expertise to automate the entire process – from the collection of data to the filing of VAT returns in different countries and the integration of transactions into the seller&#8217;s accounting system”.</p>
<p>Koenigsheim says a typical Taxdoo customer sells products on different marketplaces and their own shop, with annual revenues of around €5-10 million. “Our largest customers are global consumer brands with annual revenues of €150 million and above,” he says.</p>
<p>Examples include D2C brands like air up and YFood or e-commerce companies OmniDeal and sellvin. “Among others, we partner with tax professionals, ERP systems, and e-commerce agencies to help them handle these complex issues for their clients,” adds Koenigsheim.</p>
<p>“Our secret sauce is that we automate the entire workflow from end-to-end. This starts with the aggregation of data from different channels like marketplaces, shops, and ERP systems using our automated connectors. Our system [then] analyses data under all applicable regulations and prepares the required returns across the EU, which are filed by an international network of tax partners using a convenient software solution created by us”.</p>
<p>Taxdoo data can also be exported to a seller’s accounting system, enabling them to more easily collaborate with local tax advisors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the addressable market is growing fast, in part helped by accelerated digitisation during the pandemic and the growth of e-commerce. Taxdoo cites data showing that cross-border transactions now represents approximately 25% of total e-commerce transactions in Western Europe and Scandinavia, and is rising.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Accel’s Harry Nelis: “With a booming e-commerce landscape and companies of all sizes looking to sell their products and services internationally, we see an acute need for integrated financial and tax compliance. Taxdoo’s founders bring together unique experience at the intersection of tax, finance and software and we are excited to work with them to build Taxdoo into a category defining company”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/deena-shakir" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="deena-shakir">Deena Shakir <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> joined <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lux-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lux-capital">Lux Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a partner last year after spending seven years with Google, the last of them with GV, Google&#8217;s venture unit.</p>
<p>While Shakir seems to fit right in with the firm &#8212; known for its wealth of PhDs and moonshot investments &#8212; venture wasn&#8217;t something she was focused on as a career, as she told us during a lengthy interview last week. An Iraqi-American who grew up in Silicon Valley after her parents immigrated to the region, Shakir put herself through both Harvard, then Georgetown&#8217;s School of Foreign Service through a mix of merit scholarships and work and thought she might become a doctor or nab a PhD in anthropology.</p>
<p>Instead, an internship with the BBC saw her cover an historic White House speech, which led her to spend more than two years at the State Department, working for then Secretary Clinton. When she later headed home to be with her family, she was aware that she wanted to make an impact; she didn&#8217;t foresee making it through her investments, yet that&#8217;s what&#8217;s now happening.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know Shakir, it&#8217;s worth listening to our conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-frontier-tech-is-going-mainstream/id1498270180?i=1000502187169">here </a>at some point; in the meantime, here are some lightly edited excerpts that shine a light on where she is placing her bets and why.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Lux is known for investing in rocket companies and satellites, though its website actually lists 21 different industries in its portfolio. Did the firm&#8217;s deals arise from these industries that interest the firm or because of teams that interest the firm and that happen to operate in these industries? </strong></p>
<p>DS: I actually find some of this industry categorization as problematic because if you look through the portfolio, you&#8217;ll see we love healthcare, meats, robotics, AI, food production, industrial IoT, and data meets FinTech. It really is intersectional in terms of how we approach industries; that&#8217;s the nature of how we think about investing. But in terms of how we think about where we want to make investments, we certainly have areas where historically we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time that have given us insights into where there are white spaces [such as having worked on] autonomous vehicles and having insights through that experience into the types of software platforms that could power the next generation of autonomy. So there&#8217;s definitely a lot of generational and evolutionary investing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Last week, Lux participated in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-incubated-at-founders-fund-emerges-with-9-million-in-funding/">seed round</a> a startup called Varda that is centered around manufacturing in space. What is it trying to make in space and why?</strong></p>
<p>DS: There are few companies that I think would be perceived as more of a Lux fit than Varda. We pride ourselves on companies that turns science fiction into fact [including in the] space space. We were in Relativity Space; we&#8217;re in a number of satellite companies &#8212; Orbital Insight and Planet and several others.</p>
<p>But this is not only a space that we&#8217;re interested in, but also the founding team is one that we&#8217;ve had the chance to get to know over time and felt very strongly about. It is not an intuitive company, which is probably part of the reason why you might be asking about it, like: what exactly do they do, right? At the end of the day, it&#8217;s quite early, but they&#8217;re working on two things that we really love &#8212; manufacturing and space &#8212; abd there are some really interesting innovations that we&#8217;re just at the very beginning of understanding their application in space [including around] physical processes and the supply chain. And this team is at the forefront of taking those on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is it going to be manufacturing carbon nanotubes in space to take to the ISS? What&#8217;s the need it&#8217;s addressing?</strong></p>
<p>DK: At the end of the day, the need is around cost and supply chain. It&#8217;s still extremely expensive to launch anything into orbit &#8212; we&#8217;re talking tens of millions of dollars if not more. That&#8217;s the key problem that they want to solve. Manufacturing in space is the hypothesis here. And they have some fascinating and confidential, at this point, hypotheses as to how they will be able to do that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there enough later-stage funding for companies that will need a lot of capital? Lux is now managing $2.5 billion in assets, after raising $1 billion last year. But some space investors say there is not [enough to go around] partly because there haven&#8217;t yet been enough liquidity events.</strong></p>
<p>DK: That&#8217;s interesting, because we got excited about what we now call frontier tech before that was really a category &#8212; certainly before it had any venture-return profile. Now, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that frontier tech is no longer at the frontier. It&#8217;s becoming a key part of many large enterprises. And we&#8217;re seeing huge companies producing rockets en masse. We&#8217;re seeing private companies launch rockets into space and collaborate with NASA. We&#8217;re also seeing venture-funded companies that previously sounded like science fiction that are approaching just phenomenal valuations. So it does seem like we&#8217;re at a turning point here. If you take a look at the cap tables [of] these types of companies, you&#8217;ll see players that may not necessarily have taken those types of bets earlier on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One of your bets is <a href="https://www.shiru.com/">Shiru</a>, which is leveraging computational design to create enhanced proteins to help feed the world. What does it say about your interests and process?</strong></p>
<p>DS: I spent a lot of time, especially at GV, with some of the alternative protein companies in our portfolio. And a big part of what I&#8217;ve done since my days in government, and certainly throughout my time at Google, has been talking to commercial partners, Fortune 500 companies, and understanding what their needs are. A big part of my role at GV was helping to plug in these large, behemoth companies with up-and-coming tech companies and help them to meet the innovation demands that they have, and that&#8217;s a large part of where my thesis came from.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe that there is a huge opportunity in food that enables these Fortune 500 food companies to meet the increasing demands from consumers, environmental demands, and cost demands [related to] animal-based ingredients. Shiru&#8217;s approach is an interesting one because they are taking a business model that has worked quite well in pharma . . .in enabling the production of novel IP. In this case, [it&#8217;s] novel plant-based proteins, using machine learning and computational biology and actually licensing it to these food companies so they can go on to produce their own versions of the Impossible Burger or Beyond Meat or simply replace a costly animal-based ingredient in one of their products.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Another of your deals is <a href="https://www.allstripes.com/">AllStripes</a>, which aggregates and analyzes medical records, then sells the de identified data to pharma companies to help them develop medicines. So the common thread is machine learning?</strong></p>
<p>DS: Yes, so for me, it&#8217;s about machine learning AI that&#8217;s streamlining a really analog industry, whether it&#8217;s education, whether it&#8217;s finance, whether it&#8217;s food, and certainly healthcare, where I spend the majority of my time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are some of the areas you&#8217;re digging into?</strong></p>
<p>DK: Within healthcare, specifically, I am spending a lot of time looking at women&#8217;s health and within women&#8217;s health. I am looking a lot at fertility tech, and I&#8217;ve seen everything from robotic cryo storage to embryo selection to consumerized clinics for IVF. And it&#8217;s definitely an interesting market and one that&#8217;s growing, especially if you look more broadly at demographic trends in terms of women having children later in life, as well as what we&#8217;re seeing in terms of IVF rates and other countries as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a mother of two young kids and had some pretty scary medical experiences myself with with both of their births, and that definitely inspired a look into that space as a patient, but also one where I think there&#8217;s really been underinvestment. I get really frustrated when I hear anyone talk about women&#8217;s health as niche, there is nothing niche about it. From the pure numbers perspective, [women] represents obviously half the population. But women also account for over 80% of dollars spent in healthcare and so companies that are focused on women in the healthcare space are also excellent wedges into other areas.</p>
<p>So outside of those areas in women&#8217;s health, I&#8217;m looking at menopause and at aging in place for anyone across the gender spectrum. Mental health is a huge one, too. I come from a family of physicians. My father is a psychiatrist. In fact, that&#8217;s the reason I grew up in the Bay Area. He came to Stanford in the &#8217;70s for his residency in psychiatry and I&#8217;ve had a lifelong fascination with mental health. In fact, like many children of immigrants, for a hot minute I thought I was going to be a doctor myself and and even interned with VA&#8217;s psychiatry department right before going to college.</p>
<p>Part of why I get excited about it is because it is one of the fields in medicine that&#8217;s still so untouched by tech &#8212; certainly on the data side in terms of being slow to adopt EHRs. On the diagnostic and therapeutic side, there have been some really interesting non-pharmacological interventions for mental health, like TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation), but it has been elusive to attack and, of course, it&#8217;s top of mind for many folks right now with the mental health burden on everyone at the pandemic. So we&#8217;re seeing a lot of really interesting novel approaches emerge, as well as tailwinds propelling some companies that have been around for a while in a space.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Lux actually formed a $345 million <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/announcing-lux-health-tech-acquisition-corp-2f02fa4b39ba">health-care focused SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, in October.</a> Is that one of many to come and also, is the idea to perhaps back a company that Lux has funded earlier in time or an outfit it has no association with whatsoever?</strong></p>
<p>DS: We believe that SPACs are really powerful for companies that have an exciting big story to tell and whose value isn&#8217;t necessarily best evaluated by looking in the rearview mirror. And given the changing nature of health care, particularly given everything the pandemic has done, it&#8217;s a particularly salient and interesting opportunity for health care.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve have gotten some <em>really</em> interesting inbound from some of the top companies in the healthcare space. As you can imagine, it&#8217;s just a very, very interesting time for healthcare. We&#8217;re not looking at our own portfolio companies. But a number of our companies are going down that path, and we&#8217;re encouraging them to [pursue it].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenoti">Zenoti, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a 10-year-old startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/zenoti-raises-15-million-for-spa-bookings/">develops services for the spa and salon industry</a>, is the latest entrant to the coveted unicorn list.</p>
<p>The Bellevue, Washington-headquartered SaaS startup has raised $160 million in its Series D financing round that valued it at “well past $1 billion,” said Sudheer Koneru, founder and chief executive of Zenoti, in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week. The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/advent-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="advent-international">Advent International <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Tiger Global and Steadview Partners. The startup has raised about $251 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zenoti.com/">Zenoti</a>, which started its journey in India, has built a cloud management solution for health and wellness industries. The startup’s platform allows customers to pay directly from a mobile app after their appointment. It also checks them in when they walk into the store and notifies the providers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For their clients, Zenoti allows them to accept bookings, accept digital payments, handle payroll, manage backend inventory, and transfer the tip from customers to directly a staff’s bank account. The startup was founded in 2010, but it wasn’t until 2012 when it had built this complete stack and went to the market.</p>
<p>Zenoti’s platform combines both the ERP and CRM tools. And that’s what this industry, which had surprisingly been underserved prior to Zenoti’s entry, needed, explained Shekhar Kirani, partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Accel was the first investor to back Zenoti. Unlike offerings from companies such as Microsoft and Notion, for instance, that have built “horizontal” services that people across the industries use, the spa and salon industry needed a “vertical” player that just looked at solving the issues that they were facing, he explained. Zenoti did just that.</p>
<p>It became very clear early on that Zenoti could pursue customers beyond India. That early bet has proven right for the startup, for which the U.S. now accounts for 60% of the revenue, followed by the UK. Over 12,000 businesses including Hand &amp; Stone and Gene Juarez in more than 50 countries today use Zenoti&#8217;s offering. The startup works with higher-end businesses.</p>
<p>Kirani described the success of Zenoti as a growing SaaS movement in India, which has produced scores of startups such as Freshworks, Zoho, MindTickle, and Chargebee that started in the world’s second largest internet market but now have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/">most of their customers outside of the country</a>.</p>
<p>Zenoti&#8217;s offerings have proven even more useful in recent months as the pandemic prompted firms to move several aspects of their businesses digital. An increasingly growing number of spa and salon chains that previously did not adopt digital offerings are now embracing mobile apps and ways to cut reliance on paper bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing businesses embrace Zenoti’s technology to help pivot and strengthen their offering, and we are impressed by the company’s growth over the last year, particularly among some of the most established brands in the industry,” said Eric Wei, Managing Director of Advent International, in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, the startup has grown by 100% this year, its best to date, and has a large backlog of businesses who want to become customers, said Koneru, who is hopeful to maintain this growth momentum next year. (Zenoti employees also donated $250,000 to help the workers in the industry they serve.)</p>
<p>Zenoti, which employs about 550 people, does not make money from end-customers and instead charges a subscription fee to businesses. Koneru, who previously worked at Microsoft and invested in offline spa businesses, said that while the startup is currently not turning a profit, its margin has improved and the revenue growth has accelerated. He declined to share figures.</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to some additional categories such as grooming. In recent months, it has started to serve gyms and other fitness centres. Zenoti is also open to exploring M&amp;A opportunities, Koneru said, adding that these acquisitions would ideally fuel the startup&#8217;s customer growth instead of broadening the technology stack.</p>
