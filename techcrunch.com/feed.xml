										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.photomath.app/en/">Photomath</a>, the popular mobile app that helps you solve equations, has raised a $23 million Series B funding round led by Menlo Ventures. The app is a massive consumer success, and chances are you might already know about it if you have a teenager in your household.</p>
<p>The app lets you point your phone’s camera at a math problem. It recognizes what’s written and gives you a step-by-step explanation to solve the problem. You might think that it’s the perfect app for lazy students.</p>
<p>But there are many different use cases for Photomath. For instance, you can write an equation in your notebook and use Photomath to draw a graph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typing an equation on a keyboard is quite difficult. That’s why bridging the gap between the physical world and your smartphone is key to Photomath’s success. You can just grab a pen and write something down on a piece of paper. Essentially, it’s an AR calculator.</p>
<p>GSV Ventures, Learn Capital, Cherubic Ventures and Goodwater Capital are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Behind the app’s success, there’s an interesting story. Photomath was originally designed as a demo app for another company called MicroBlink. At the time, the team was working on text recognition technology. It planned to sell its core technology to other companies that might find it useful.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/microblink-launches-photomath-to-solve-math-equations-with-a-phone/">they pitched MicroBlink</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in London. And things changed drastically overnight as Photomath reached the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/disrupt-london-finalist-photomath-rockets-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">first spot</a> of the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>Photomath has now attracted over 220 million downloads. As of this writing, it is still #59 in the U.S. App Store, one rank above Tinder. Other companies tried to build competitors, but it seems like they didn’t manage to crush the tiny European startup.</p>
<p>The app seems even more relevant as many kids are spending more time studying at home. They can’t simply raise their hand to call the teacher for some help.</p>
<p>Photomath is free and users can optionally pay for Photomath Plus, a premium version with more features, such as dynamic illustrations and animated tutorials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber today notified employees that it will extend its work from home policy through September 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;In considering the extension, we took into account the latest scientific data and experts’ views; the fact that different countries are at different stages of recovery; and the start of the school year,&#8221; Uber Chief People Officer Nikki Krish wrote in an email, viewed by TechCrunch, to employees. &#8220;[&#8230;] We know that some CommOps, IT, or other roles require physical presence in an office, so please continue to work within the policies your teams have developed—however, as always, we won’t force anyone to go into the office if they have medical concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber is also encouraging employees to get vaccinated when it&#8217;s possible to do so. In the email, Krish said Uber employees will be able to take time off in order to get vaccinated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August, Uber notified employees that they should expect to work from home through June 2021. As for other tech companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/google-will-continue-to-let-employees-work-from-home-through-the-end-of-june-2021/">Google in July</a> extended its work from home policy through the end of June 2021, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/facebook-extends-coronavirus-work-from-home-policy-until-july-2021/">Facebook in August</a> extended its remote work policy until July 2021.</p>
<p>Post-COVID, Uber will likely have a hybrid work model, Krish said, but it&#8217;s still a work in progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re taking a number of aspects into consideration, such as how being physically together benefits or reduces productivity, collaboration, and engagement,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;We’ll update you on where things stand in a few weeks, and along the way as we make progress.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use Office, Microsoft would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/microsoft-really-really-really-doesnt-want-you-to-buy-office-2019/">really, really, really</a> like you to buy a cloud-enabled subscription to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365?&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;OCID=AID2100139_SEM_Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;lnkd=Google_O365SMB_Brand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB">Microsoft 365</a> (formerly Office 365). But as the company promised, it will continue to make a stand-alone, perpetual license for Office available for the foreseeable future. A while back, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/microsoft-really-really-really-doesnt-want-you-to-buy-office-2019/">launched Office 2019</a>, which includes the standard suite of Office tools, but is frozen in time and without the benefit of the regular feature updates and cloud-based tools that come with the subscription offering.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft is announcing what is now called the Microsoft Office LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel). It&#8217;ll be available as a commercial preview in April and will be available on both Mac and Windows, in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>
<p>And like with the previous version, it&#8217;s clear that Microsoft would really prefer if you just moved to the cloud already. But it also knows that not everybody can do that, so it now calls this version with its perpetual license that you pay for once and then use for as long as you want to (or have compatible hardware) a &#8220;specialty product for specific scenarios. Those scenarios, Microsoft agrees, include situations where you have a regulated device that can&#8217;t accept feature updates for years at a time, process control devices on a manufacturing floor and other devices that simply can&#8217;t be connected to the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We expect that most customers who use Office LTSC won&#8217;t do it across their entire organization, but only in specific scenarios,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s CVP for Microsoft 365, Jared Spataro, writes in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a specialty product, Microsoft will also raise the price for Office Professional Plus, Office Standard, and the individual Office apps by up to 10%.</p>
<p>&#8220;To fuel the work of the future, we need the power of the cloud,&#8221; writes Spataro. &#8220;The cloud is where we invest, where we innovate, where we discover the solutions that help our customers empower everyone in their organization – even as we all adjust to a new world of work. But we also acknowledge that some of our customers need to enable a limited set of locked-in-time scenarios, and these updates reflect our commitment to helping them meet this need.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have one of these special use cases, the price increase will not likely deter you and you&#8217;ll likely be happy to hear that Microsoft is committing to another release in this long-term channel in the future, too.</p>
<p>As for the new features in this release, Spataro notes that will have dark mode support, new capabilities like Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP in Excel, and performance improvements across the board. One other change worth calling out is that it will not ship with Skype for Business but the Microsoft Teams app (though you can still download Skype for Business if you need it).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/wendell-brooks-has-resigned-as-president-of-intel-capital/">Wendell Brooks stepped down</a> as managing partner and head of Intel Capital last August, Anthony Lin was named to replace him on an interim basis. At the time, it wasn&#8217;t clear if he would be given the role permanently, but today, six months later, the answer is known.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-capital/news/story.html?id=a0F1I00000CSXjbUAH#/type=All/page=0/term=/tags="> letter to the firm&#8217;s portfolio CEOs</a> published on the company website, Lin mentioned, almost casually that he had taken on the two roles on a permanent basis. &#8220;Personally, I want to share that I have been appointed to managing partner and head of Intel Capital. I have been a member of the investment committee for the past several years and am humbly awed by the talent of our entrepreneurs and our team,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Lin takes over in a time of turmoil for Intel as the company struggles to regain its place in the semiconductor business that it dominated for decades. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">Intel itself has a new CEO</a> with Pat Gelsinger returning in January from VMware to lead the organization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the corporate investment arm of Intel, it looks for companies that can help the parent company understand where to invest resources in the future. If that is its goal, perhaps it hasn&#8217;t done a great job as Intel has lost some of its edge when it comes to innovation.</p>
<p>Lin, who was formerly head of mergers and acquisitions and international investing at the firm, can use the power of the firm&#8217;s investment dollars to try help point the parent company in the right direction and help find new ways to build innovative solutions on the Intel platform.</p>

<p>Lin acknowledged how challenging 2020 was for everyone, and his company was no exception, but the firm invested in 75 startups including 35 new deals and 40 deals involving companies it had previously invested in. It  has also made a commitment to invest in companies with more diverse founders. To that end, 30% of new venture stage dollars went to startups led by diverse leaders, according to Lin.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the company made a five year commitment that 15% of all of its deals would go to companies with Black founders. It made some progress towards that goal, but there is still a ways to go. &#8220;At the end of 2020, 9% of our new venture deals and 15% of our venture dollars committed were in companies led by Black founders. We know there is more progress to be made and we will continue to encourage, foster and invest in diverse and inclusive teams,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Lin faces a big challenge ahead as he takes over a role that had the same leader for the first 28 years in Arvind Sodhani. His predecessor, Brooks, was there for five years. Now it passes to Lin and he needs to use the firm&#8217;s investment might to help Gelsinger advance the goals of the broader firm, while making sound investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong><em>Update: </em></strong><em>There&#8217;s an entire second session of this? My lord.</em></p>
<p>Today the <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> dragged the CEO of Reddit, a Cato wonk, social media icon DeepFuckingValue, the CEO of Citadel Kenneth Griffin, a hedgefund bro who got whomped <em>by</em> DeepFuckingValue, and the CEO of Robinhood Vlad Tenev, who got womped when individual investors joined DeepFuckingValue in his womping of the hedge fund and thus womped his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">capital requirements</a> leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">general market chaos</a>, before them virtually for questioning.</p>
<p>It was not very useful. Between a cascade of Zoom failures &#8212; mutings, incorrect unmutings, a green screen that was not actually in use, and an actual gavel &#8212; members of Congress largely took five minute slots to embarass themselves, and not make material points.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The format was not conducive to real questioning, and most questions were both too long and either too precise, and misguided in their direction, or too imprecise, even if they landed in the strike zone. Sitting here I am trying to recall a single thing that I learned. I suppose that Robinhood&#8217;s CEO was not sure on the details of his company&#8217;s arbitration agreement with users. And perhaps a little bit about how <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1362468077720453123">many of its users trade options</a>. And that Reddit&#8217;s CEO has a nice suit.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some members of Congress mocked the proceedings, calling them political theater. That earned a rebuke by Maxine Waters, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some members of Congress nearly got around to asking something useful. But largely the method of asking questions was bilge, the responses canned, and nothing much uncovered.</span></p>
<p>What would have worked? I suppose Congress could have brought in a few actual experts and a more limited number of guests, and then hammered them with questions about the ethical reality of payment for order flow, Robinhood&#8217;s app mechanics and how easily it offers access to exotic trading tools, and the like. That would have helped.</p>
<p>Instead, we got great stuff like this:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I believe that investing is investing&quot; &#8211; Steve Huffman</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Which was not very helpful. That said, there were some good memes and jokes, so, let&#8217;s have some fun instead of being annoyed with our elected representatives:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Did you buy GameStock because you were not aware of payment for order flow&quot; is an incredible series of words to put one after the other</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The rest of it was a waste of time. As I write this sentence to you, a member of Congress just asked how Robinhood go its name. Which is dumb, as the name is <em>so obvious it nearly makes your head hurt with how earnest it is</em>.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s that. This was a waste. Real questions remain. They largely didn&#8217;t get asked, and certainly didn&#8217;t get answered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has appointed Dr. Marian Croak to lead its responsible artificial intelligence division within Google Research, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/google-to-reorganize-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported earlier today. </a>Croak was previously the vice president of engineering at the company.</span></p>
<p>In her new role, Croak will oversee the teams working on accessibility, AI for social good, algorithmic fairness in health, brain fairness, ethical AI and others. She&#8217;ll report to Jeff Dean, SVP of Google AI Research and Health. In a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/">Google blog post and video confirming the news</a>, Croak said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This field, the field of responsible AI and ethics, is new. Most institutions have only developed principles, and they’re very high-level, abstract principles, in the last five years. There’s a lot of dissension, a lot of conflict in terms of trying to standardize on normative definitions of these principles. Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use? There’s quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times. And what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.</span></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all comes after the departure of Dr. Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team, as well as the corporate lockout of researcher Margaret Mitchell, founder of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team. </span>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Gebru, <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html">according to Axios</a>. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned. In a statement to Axios at the time, Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our security systems automatically lock an employee’s corporate account when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered. In this instance, yesterday our systems detected that an account had exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple external accounts. We explained this to the employee earlier today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mitchell is still locked out of her account, and tweeted today about how she only found out about the reorganization through the Bloomberg story.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8230;And this is how I find out. I&#39;m so glad for all the trust they&#39;ve rebuilt. It seems I&#39;ve been completely erased and my team taken.<a href="https://t.co/1BTGOo5Wry">https://t.co/1BTGOo5Wry</a></p>
<p>&mdash; MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362469250053533697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Google to try to determine what this means for Mitchell, but the company declined to comment on her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.queenly.com/">Queenly</a>, a marketplace for formalwear, launched into a world where its core product of dresses and gowns had a massive competitor, bigger and more elusive than Poshmark: quarantine.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused the fancy in-person events that one might attend, such as award shows, pageants, proms and weddings to be canceled to limit spread. But despite the fact that you might be rocking sweats over slacks, Queenly co-founders Trisha Bantigue and Kathy Zhou say that they had half a million in sales last year, and over 100,000 people visit their website everyday.</p>
<p>“So many women bought dresses to just dress up and feel normal at home, when everything else around the world was not,” Bantigue said. “It helped them feel grounded and stabilize themselves in this crazy chaotic pandemic environment.” The canceled events have also found new homes, such as Zoom weddings, Twitch pageants, socially distant proms and graduation car parades. The co-founder added that content creators on TikTok and YouTube have also bought Queenly dresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pandemic growth added a surprising dimension to Queenly’s business, and the Bay Area startup is currently partaking in the Y Combinator winter cohort to navigate it. So far, it has raised $800,000 to date from investors including Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix, Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber, and Kelly Thompson, former COO of Samsclub.com and Walmart.com. The goal, the co-founders tell me, is to become the StockX for formalwear.</p>
<p>Queenly is a marketplace for buying and selling formal dresses, from wedding dresses to pageant gowns. The 50,000 dresses on the platform are either new or resale, and sellers get paid 80% of the price that the gowns go for.</p>
<p>Part of the company’s biggest sell, according to the co-founders, is its algorithm that matches buyers to dresses. Before Queenly, Zhou was a former software engineer at Pinterest who helped build content creation flows and the back end of the platform. She took the same focus that her and her Pinterest co-workers had on data-driven search and development and applied it to Queenly.</p>
<p>The search engine can go deeper than a normal dress search on Macy’s can, which might create options based on size, color and cut. In contrast, Queenly can help offer more diverse insights with a larger range of sizes, silhouette options and different shades of the same color.</p>
<p>Last week, a seller sold her wedding dress with a tag that says the dark mesh on the dress is for a darker skin tone. Queenly is beta-testing a feature that lets you search <a href="https://queenly.com/search?q=medium%20skin%20tone%20sheer">medium skin tone</a> sheer options or <a href=" https://queenly.com/search?q=dark%20skin%20tone%20sheer">dark skin tone</a> sheer options. The team says that skin-tone filters are one of the important long-term goals of their search engine.</p>
<p>“These are just some things that we know because we&#8217;re women, and we know how to build this product for women,” Zhou said. “As opposed to if this was a male founder, they would not know that that would even be something that women would search for.”</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 50,000 dresses for sale on the Queenly platform, ranging from $70 to $4,000 and going up to size 32.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114886" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114886" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2114886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png" alt="" width="813" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png 4181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=1536,846 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=2048,1129 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Queenly</p></div></p>
<p>With these search insights, Queenly says that it is able to sell dresses within two weeks, claiming that some users say that their same dresses spent five months on the Poshmark platform.</p>
<p>The diversity of dresses, from a price and range perspective, is one of the ways that Queenly stays competitive with large retail brands like Nordstrom.</p>
<p>“Buying and carrying inventory is very capital intensive for any startup,” Bantigue said. “As female minority founders it was hard for us to raise in the beginning.” As a result, the startup doesn’t keep a physical inventory of dresses, but instead relies on users to help get dresses from owner to buyer. If a dress is under $200, Queenly sends a prepaid shipping label to the seller to mail directly to the end buyer. If a dress is over $200, Queenly gets the dress sent directly to the company, does light dry cleaning and authentication, and then sends it right to the user.</p>
<p>Bringing the users into the transaction process adds a layer of risk because it depends on people to do things for the startup to be successful. The incentive here is that sellers make 80% of their sale price, and Queenly pockets the other 20%.</p>
<p>The startup’s biggest cost is shipping. To limit these costs, Queenly currently doesn’t accept or honor any returns, unless the dress upon arrival is not what was described in the sales post.</p>
<p>While this is a sensical business decision, it could be a hurdle for the startups’ clientele. Sizes are complicated and inconsistent, so the inability to return a dress might stifle a customer’s appetite to buy in the first place.</p>
<p>“We were actually worried about this before, but for two years now we [have not] had a complaint about sizing,” Bantigue said.</p>
<p>The co-founders say that many buyers are comfortable tailoring a dress post-purchase, and sellers are required to post pictures so expectations are set pre-purchase. There have been no cases of counterfeit brands to date, Bantigue said.</p>
<p>Queenly’s next plan is to bring on boutique stores and dress designers for Queenly partners, a program started to help small boutique businesses digitize their inventory through the Queenly platform.</p>
<p>“For years, the formalwear industry has been mostly offline, with only big name players being available online,” Bantigue said. “We want to change this.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today the Apple TV+ streaming service has now arrived on the Google TV platform, starting with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-chromecast-adds-a-remote-and-the-new-google-tv-interface-for-49/">Chromecast with Google TV</a>. It will also become available on Google TVs from both Sony and TCL, with expansions to other Android TV-powered devices in the months to come, Google says.</p>
<p>Google TV was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/"> introduced last September</a> as the new way Google will refer to its interface for Chromecast, where it combines streaming services, live TV via YouTube TV and other Google offerings, into one user interface &#8212; making it more competitive with similar offerings from Apple and Amazon. Today, the platform supports a wide range of top streaming services, like Disney+, Netflix, HBO Max, Peacock, Prime Video, CBS All Access, Hulu, Soing and others, including, of course, YouTube.</p>
<p>With the added support for Apple TV+, users who already have subscriptions will be able to tune into its original programming, which includes movies, documentaries and series like &#8220;Ted Lasso,&#8221; &#8220;For All Mankind,&#8221; &#8220;Servant,&#8221; &#8220;The Morning Show,&#8221; &#8220;Dickinson&#8221; and others. The app also provides access to the user&#8217;s library of movies and shows purchased from Apple, recommendations, and supports Family Sharing. The latter allows up to six family members to share a subscription to Apple TV+ and Apple TV channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following the app&#8217;s launch on Google TV, users in the U.S. will be able to browse Apple&#8217;s Originals in Google TV&#8217;s personalized recommendations and surface its content in search results. Users can also ask Google Assistant to open the Apple TV app or they can request an Apple Original title by name. And they&#8217;ll be able to add Apple TV+ programming to the Google TV Watchlist. Google says these features will arrive in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; however, instead of at launch.</p>
<p>The launch makes Google TV one of the last of the major streaming device platforms to support Apple&#8217;s streaming service, which is otherwise broadly available.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/apple-tv-to-launch-november-1-for-4-99-month-one-year-free-comes-with-select-apple-devices/">debuted</a> in November 2019 for Apple customers, and later rolled out to non-Apple platforms including, that same year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/the-apple-tv-app-arrives-on-roku-ahead-of-apple-tv-streaming-service-launch/">Roku devices</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-app-comes-to-amazons-fire-tv-stick-and-other-devices/"> Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV platform</a>. Today, it&#8217;s also now available across a variety of smart TVs by Samsung, LG, Vizio and Sony; gaming consoles including PlayStation (PS4 &amp; PS5) and Xbox (One, Series X, Series S); and via the web.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today we know of HubSpot — the maker of marketing, sales and service software products — as a preeminent public company with a market cap above $17 billion. But HubSpot wasn’t always on the IPO trajectory.</p>
<p>For its first five years in business, HubSpot offered three subscription packages ranging in price from $3,000 to $18,000 per year. The company <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/how-to-overhaul-pricing-in-3-steps/">struggled with poor churn</a> and anemic expansion revenue. Net revenue retention was near 70%, a far cry from the 100%+ that most SaaS companies aim to achieve.</p>
<p>Something needed to change. So in 2011, they introduced <a href="https://offers.openviewpartners.com/usage-based-pricing-playbook">usage-based pricing</a>. As customers used the software to generate more leads, they would proportionally increase their spend with HubSpot.  This pricing change allowed HubSpot to share in the success of its customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In a usage-based model, expansion “just happens” as customers are successful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>By the time HubSpot went public in 2014, net revenue retention had jumped to nearly 100% — all without hurting the company’s ability to acquire new customers.</p>
<p>HubSpot isn’t an outlier. Public SaaS companies that have adopted usage-based pricing grow faster because they’re better at landing new customers, growing with them and keeping them as customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108918" style="width: 914px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108918" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2108918" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png" alt="" width="904" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108918" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyle Poyar</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Widen the top of the funnel</strong></h2>
<p>In a usage-based model, a company doesn’t get paid until after the customer has adopted the product. From the customer’s perspective, this means that there’s no risk to try before they buy. Products like Snowflake and Google Cloud Platform take this a step further and even offer $300+ in free usage credits for new developers to test drive their products.</p>
<p>Many of these free users won’t become profitable — and that’s okay. Like a VC firm, usage-based companies are making a portfolio of bets. Some of those will pay off spectacularly — and the company will directly share in that success.</p>
<p>Top-performing companies open up the top of the funnel by making it free to sign up for their products. They invest in a frictionless customer onboarding experience and high-quality support so that new users get hooked on the platform. As more new users become active, there’s a stronger foundation for future customer growth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doing home renovations yourself can be more cost-effective than hiring a contractor, but many people don&#8217;t know where to begin. Ian Janicki, the founder and CEO of DIY home renovation startup <a href="https://www.buildoutfit.com/">Outfit</a>, has always wanted to make architecture and design more accessible to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized I could leverage my knowledge of being handy to create a product that scaled,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For those who want to go through the Outfit process, the first step is submitting information about the space they&#8217;re looking to renovate, such as dimensions and photos, as well as the maximum amount they&#8217;re looking to spend. Outfit then provides information about the expected cost of the project, the handiness level required to complete the project and everything that would need to be done in order to complete the project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We make sure it&#8217;s transparent and that you understand the amount of time that might be required,&#8221; Janicki said.</p>
<p>Once someone decides they want to move forward, Outfit then sends all the necessary tools and materials to the customer. Through the app, Outfit offers a step-by-step guide for completing the project. In the event someone gets stuck, they can chat with Janicki or someone else from the Outfit team for support.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114267" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114267" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png 2290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=2048,1066 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Outfit</p></div></p>
<p>Outfit has had a small set of pilot customers &#8212; some who have completed their projects and some whose projects are still underway.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The millennial generation is now starting to purchase their homes and has been accelerated because of remote work and COVID,&#8221; Janicki said. &#8220;They’re the Ikea generation and can put together bookshelves and are really used to digital experiences and are now demanding this digital solution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So far, the projects have ranged in cost from $1,000 to $15,000, but it really depends on things like how invasive the project is, how big the space is and more, Janicki said. The rendered &#8220;after&#8221; photo below would probably cost about $9,000. In general, Outfit charges customers the cost of the actual materials (e.g. power drills, wrenches, cabinets, tiles, etc.) and then adds a percentage of the total on top as a surcharge to the customer.</p>

<p>Down the road, Outfit envisions offering rentals of the tools themselves, but Janicki said he just wanted to streamline everything in the early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reverse logistics is complicated to we&#8217;re trying to take it one step at a time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are a number of home improvement startups out there, such as <a href="https://www.eano.com/">Eano</a>, <a href="https://www.rennohome.com/">Renno</a> and others, but Janicki said he&#8217;s not aware of any direct competitors. He said he recognizes that there are some people who are fully capable of buying all the necessary items themselves, watching a video on YouTube and then completing the project. Meanwhile, homeowners are also just as capable of hiring someone to do the project for them. But with Outfit, Janicki sees it as somewhere in between. He calls it &#8220;DIY plus.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In terms of being handy, it’s a rare trait that everyone appreciates,&#8221; Janicki said. &#8220;If we can elevate people in their handiness level, I’m going to be super happy. It’s that pride that you were actually able to accomplish that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Outfit is currently available nationwide. To date, the company has backing from Y Combinator, and previously raised about $700,000 from investors like GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, B Capital Group&#8217;s Crissy Costa, Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a year after Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/google-launches-the-first-developer-preview-of-android-11/">announced</a> the first developer preview of Android 11, the company today released<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"> the first developer preview of Android 12</a>. Google delayed the roll-out of Android 11 a bit as the teams and the company&#8217;s partners adjusted to working during a pandemic, but it looks like that didn&#8217;t stop it from keeping Android 12 on schedule. As you would expect from an early developer preview, most of the changes here are under the hood and there&#8217;s no over-the-air update yet for intrepid non-developers who want to give it a spin.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114865" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114865" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2114865" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png 784w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/android12.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Among the highlights of the release so far &#8212; and it&#8217;s important to note that Google tends to add more user-facing changes and UI updates throughout the preview cycle &#8212; are the ability to transcode media into higher-quality formats like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AV1 image format</a>, faster and more responsive notifications and a new feature for developers that now makes individual changes in the platform togglable so they can more easily test the compatibility of their apps. Google also promises that <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/android-11-beta-2-and-platform-stability.html">just like with Android 11</a>, it&#8217;ll add a Platform Stability milestone to Android 12 to give developers advance notice when final app-facing changes will occur in the development cycle of the operating system. Last year, the team hit that milestone in July when it launched its second beta release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With each version, we’re working to make the OS smarter, easier to use, and better performing, with privacy and security at the core,&#8221; writes Google VP of Engineering Dave Burke. &#8220;In <span class="il">Android</span> <span class="il">12</span> we’re also working to give you new tools for building great experiences for users. Starting with things like compatible media transcoding, which helps your app to work with the latest video formats if you don’t already support them, and easier copy/paste of rich content into your apps, like images and videos. We’re also adding privacy protections, refreshing the UI, and optimizing performance to keep your apps responsive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously, there are dozens of developer-facing updates in Android 12. Let&#8217;s look at some in detail.</p>
<p>For the WebView in Android 12, Google will now implement the same SameSite cookie behavior as in Chrome, for example. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/google-rolls-back-samesite-cookie-changes-to-keep-essential-online-services-from-breaking/">slowed down</a> the roll-out of this change, which makes it harder for advertisers to track your activity across sites in Chrome, simply because it was breaking too many sites. Now, with this feature fully implemented in Chrome, the Android team clearly feels like it, too, can implement the same privacy tools in WebView, which other apps use to display web content, too.</p>
<p>As for the encoding capabilities, Burke notes that, &#8220;with the prevalence of HEVC hardware encoders on mobile devices, camera apps are increasingly capturing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding">HEVC format</a>, which offers significant improvements in quality and compression over older codecs.&#8221; He notes that most apps should support HEVC, but for those that can&#8217;t, Android 12 now offers a service for transcoding a file into AVC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114890" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114890" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114890" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png 1622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=768,1022 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=511,680 511w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=1154,1536 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=1539,2048 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114890" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Android 12 now also supports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AV1 Image File Format</a> as a container for images and GIF-like image sequences. &#8220;Like other modern image formats, AVIF takes advantage of the intra-frame encoded content from video compression,&#8221; explains Burke. &#8220;This dramatically improves image quality for the same file size when compared to older image formats, such as JPEG.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114916" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copy-paste-drag-and-drop-in-split-screen.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114916" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2114916" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copy-paste-drag-and-drop-in-split-screen.gif" alt="" width="320" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As with every Android release, Google also continues to tinker with the notification system. This time, the team promises a refreshed design to &#8220;make them more modern, easier to use, and more functional.&#8221; Burke calls out optimized transitions and animations and the ability for apps to decorate notifications with custom content. Google now also asks that developers <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/unified-content-api">implement</a> a system that immediately takes users from a notification to the app, without an intermediary broadcast receiver or service, something it <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#soafa">recommended before</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114914" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114914" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114914" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png" alt="" width="1024" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png 1672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=768,300 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=680,266 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=1536,601 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android 12 will now also offer better support for multi-channel audio with up to 24 channels (a boon for music and other audio apps, no doubt), spatial audio, MPEG-H support and haptic-coupled audio effects with the strength of the vibration and frequency based on the audio (a boon for games, no doubt). There&#8217;s also <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#immersive-mode-improvements">improved gesture navigation</a> and plenty of other optimizations and minor changes across the operating system.</p>
<p>Google also continues to drive forward its Project Mainline, which allows for an increasing number of the core Android OS features to be updated through the Google Play system &#8212; and hence bypasses the slow update cycles of most hardware manufacturers. With Android 12, it is bringing the Android Runtime module into Mainline, which will then let Google push updates to the core runtime and libraries to devices. &#8220;We can improve runtime performance and correctness, manage memory more efficiently, and make Kotlin operations faster &#8211; all without requiring a full system update,&#8221; Burke says. &#8220;We’ve also expanded the functionality of existing modules &#8211; for example, we’re delivering our seamless transcoding feature inside an updatable module.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find a more detailed list of all of the changes in Android 12 <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/android-12-dp1.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Developers who want to get started with bringing their apps to Android 12 can do so today by <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download">flashing a device image</a> to a Pixel device.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social audio app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> has now topped 8 million global downloads, despite still being in a prelaunch, invite-only mode, according to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/clubhouse-social-audio-apps-rise/">new data </a>released today by mobile data and analytics firm App Annie. Per its estimates, Clubhouse grew from over 3.5 million global downloads as of February 1, 2021, to reach 8.1 million by February 16, 2021. This sharp growth is attributed to several high-profile guest appearances, including those from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example.</p>
<p>App Annie also estimates that 2.6 million-plus of the total global installs took place in the U.S. &#8212; a figure that highlights the app&#8217;s global appeal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114892" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114892" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse, meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t officially shared its total number of downloads or registered users, but CEO Paul Davison revealed in January the app had grown to 2 million weekly active users &#8212; which means the app&#8217;s monthly active user figure and total registered user count would be much higher. Other <a href="https://bvajresh.medium.com/charting-the-growth-of-clubhouse-audio-app-9672aaa82f80">estimates</a> have put the app&#8217;s registered user base in between 6 million and 10 million (the latter citing unnamed sources.)</p>
<p>Reached for comment on App Annie&#8217;s report, Clubhouse said it doesn&#8217;t publish user numbers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that app install figures aren&#8217;t typically a valid proxy for registered users as many people often download an app but then never open it or sign up. But in Clubhouse&#8217;s case, the two figures could be more closely aligned as people who are installing the app are motivated to join. The app is not open to the public, so the users installing the app are likely either in possession of a Clubhouse invite or are aiming to get one from a friend or trusted contact who&#8217;s already joined.</p>
<p>Also in the new report, App Annie noted how the Clubhouse phenomenon is having an impact on the larger app ecosystem. Local rivals to Clubhouse offering their own social audio experience have also gained downloads in recent days, including <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dizhua, Tiya and Yalla, which have attracted users in China, the U.S., Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dizhua, for example, has 174,000 downloads; Tiya has 6 million; and Yalla has 34.5 million, the report says. Yalla, notably, has been live since 2016, but Clubhouse&#8217;s popularity is giving it a boost. </span></p>
<p>Beyond this small handful, there&#8217;s been an explosion of social audio experiences, including those from startups like <a href="https://sonar.app/">Sonar</a>, <a href="https://joinlockerroom.com/">Locker Room</a>, <a href="https://www.beta.wearequilt.com/">Quilt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/early-snapchat-employee-debuts-yoni-circle-a-social-storytelling-app-for-womxn/">Yoni Circle</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roadtrip-listen-together/id1390884340">Roadtrip</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-audio-conversations/id1435216195">Space</a>, <a href="https://capiche.fm/">Capiche.fm</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/yac-gets-backed-by-slack-to-bring-the-intimacy-of-voice-back-when-remote-co-workers-interact/">Yac</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cappuccino-podcast-by-friends/id1506849927">Cappuccino</a> and others. Twitter, meanwhile, is building its own Clubhouse rival with Spaces, which it said <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1362207015729266689">yesterday</a> will expand to Android by March. Facebook, too, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reportedly</a> planning a Clubhouse competitor.</p>

<p>The question on everyone&#8217;s minds now is how much of this growth is sustainable. <a href="https://medialyte.substack.com/p/portrait-of-a-clubhouse-skeptic">Skeptics say</a> Clubhouse lends itself to those who tend to dominate conversations by talking at length; that many of its conversations are just kind of boring; that the app favors the &#8220;hustle culture&#8221;-obsessed; and so on. Some also wonder how well social audio apps will fare when the world reopens post-COVID and there&#8217;s more to do &#8212; including the return to traditional networking events.</p>
<p>But these concerns don&#8217;t take into account that social audio has the potential to carve out space for itself by supplanting users&#8217; other mobile spoken-word audio activities, like podcast listening or audiobooks. Of course, questions about Clubhouse&#8217;s future can&#8217;t really be answered now, as the pandemic continues, and with an app that&#8217;s not fully open to the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plusvolta.com/">Volta Energy Technologies</a>, the energy investment and advisory services firm backed by some of the biggest names in energy and energy storage materials, has closed on nearly $90 million of a targeted $150 million investment fund, according to people familiar with the group&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The venture investment vehicle complements a $180 million existing commitment from Volta&#8217;s four corporate backers &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Equinor, Albermarle, Epsilon and Hanon Systems &#8212; and comes at a time when interest in energy storage technologies couldn&#8217;t be stronger. </span></p>
<p>As the transition away from internal combustion engines and hydrocarbon fuels begins in earnest, companies are scrambling to drive down costs and improve performance of battery technologies that will be necessary to power millions of electric cars and store massive amounts of renewable energy that still needs to be developed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Capital markets have noticed the enormity of the opportunity in transitioning away from carbon,&#8221; said Jeff Chamberlain, Volta&#8217;s founder and chief executive.</p>
<p>It was born of an idea that began in 2012 when Chamberlain began talking with the head of the Department of Energy under the Obama administration. What began when Chamberlain was at Argonne National Lab leading the development of <a href="https://www.jcesr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jcesr.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613753964828000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfxsLrsppOlykSkAgRTpM6s5_SOQ">JCESR</a>, the lead lab in the U.S. government’s battery research consortium, evolved into Volta Energy as Chamberlain pitched a private sector investment partner that could leverage the best research from National Laboratories and the work being done by private industry to find the best technology.</p>
<p>Support for the Volta project remained strong through both public and private institutions, according to Chamberlain. Even under the Trump administration, Volta&#8217;s initiative was able to thrive and wrangle some of the biggest names in chemicals, utility, oil and gas and industrial thermal management to invest in a $180 million fund that could be evergreen, Chamberlain said.</p>
<p>According to people with knowledge of the organization&#8217;s plans, the new investment fund, which is targeting $150 million but has a hard cap of $225 million, would complement the existing investment vehicle to give the firm more firepower as additional capital floods into the battery industry.</p>
<p>Chamberlain declined to comment specifically on the fund, given restrictions, but did say that his firm had a mandate to invest in technology that is battery and storage related and that &#8220;enables the ubiquitous adoption of electric vehicles and the ubiquitous adoption of solar and wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back during the first cleantech boom the brains behind Volta witnessed a lot of good money getting poured into bad ideas and vaporware that would never amount to commercial success, said Chamberlain. Volta was formed to educate investors on the real opportunities that scientists were tracking in energy storage and back those companies with dollars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew that investors were throwing money into a dumpster fire. We knew it could have a negative impact on this transition to carbon,&#8221; Chamberlain said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our whole objective was to help guide individuals deploying massive amounts of their personal wealth and move it from putting money into an ongoing dumpster fire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That mission has become even more important as more money floods into the battery market, Chamberlain said.</p>
<p>The SPAC craze set off by Nikola&#8217;s public offering in electric vehicles and continuing through QuantumScape&#8217;s battery SPAC through a slew of other electric vehicle offerings and into EV charging and battery companies has made the stakes higher for everyone, he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Battery companies are the latest SPAC target as EVs get a huge regulatory boost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/embed/#?secret=qgvFJ00AmG" data-secret="qgvFJ00AmG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chamberlain thinks of Volta&#8217;s mission as finding the best emerging technologies that are coming to market across the battery and power management supply chain and ensuring that as manufacturing capacity comes online, the technology is ready to meet growing demand.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investors who do not truly understand the energy storage ecosystem and its underlying technology challenges are at a distinct disadvantage,” said Goldman Sachs veteran and early Volta investor Randy Rochman, in a statement. “It has become abundantly clear to me that nothing happens in the world of energy storage without Volta’s knowledge. I can think of no better team to identify energy storage investment opportunities and avoid pitfalls.”  </span></p>
<p>The new fund from Volta has already backed a number of new energy storage and enabling technologies, including: <a href="https://natron.energy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which develops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high-power, fire-safe Sodium-ion batteries using Prussian blue chemistry for applications that demand a quick discharge of power; </span><a href="https://www.smartwires.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Wires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which develops hardware that acts as a router for electricity to travel across underutilized power lines to optimize the integration of renewable power and energy storage on the grid; and </span><a href="https://ionicmaterials.com/">Ionic Materials</a>, which makes<span style="font-weight: 400;"> solid lithium batteries for both transportation and grid applications. Ionic Materials’ platform technology also enables breakthrough advancements in other growing markets, such as 5G mobile, and rechargeable alkaline batteries. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a> has <a href="https://medium.com/@jacknwellis/bytedance-the-75b-social-media-unicorn-from-china-is-now-in-the-market-for-patents-909f25ef8182">acquired</a> its fair share of patents in recent years and is itself embroiled in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/triller-sues-tiktok-over-patent-infringement/">patent fight</a> with its rival Triller. That&#8217;s not what joining the LOT Network is about, though. ByteDance is joining a group of companies here that includes the likes of IBM, the Coca-Cola Company, Cisco, Lyft, Microsoft, Oracle, Target, Tencent, Tesla, VW, Ford, Waymo, Xiaomi and Zelle. In total, the group now has more than 1,300 members.</p>
<p>As LOT CEO Ken Seddon told me, the six-year-old group had a record year in 2020, with 574 companies joining and bringing its set of immunized patents to over 3 million, including 14% of all patents issued in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the core features of LOT, which only charges members who make more than $25 million in annual revenue, is that its members aren&#8217;t losing control over the patents they add to the pool. They can still buy and trade them as before, but if they decide to sell to what the industry calls a &#8220;patent assertion entity,&#8221; (PAE) that is, a patent troll, they automatically provide a free license to that patent to every other member of the group. This essentially turns LOT into what Seddon calls a &#8220;flu shot&#8221; against patent trolls (and one that&#8217;s free for startups).</p>
<p>&#8220;The conclusion that people are waking up to is, is that we&#8217;re basically like a herd, we&#8217;re herd immunization, effectively,&#8221; Seddon said. &#8220;And every time a company joins, people realize that the community of non-members shrinks by one. It&#8217;s like those that don&#8217;t have the vaccination shrinks &#8212; and they are, &#8216;wait a minute, that makes me a higher risk of getting sued. I&#8217;m a bigger target.&#8217; And they&#8217;re like, &#8216;wait a minute, I don&#8217;t want to be the target.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>ByteDance, he argues, is a good example for a company that can profit from membership in LOT. While you may think of patents as purely a sign of a company&#8217;s innovativeness, for corporate lawyers, they are also highly effective defense tools (that can be used aggressively as well, if needed). But it can take a small company years to build up a patent portfolio. But a fast-growing, successful company also becomes an obvious target for patent trolls.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are a successful company, you naturally become a target,&#8221; Seddon said. &#8220;People become jealous and they become threatened by you. And they covet your money and your revenue and your success. One of the ways that companies can defend themselves and protect their innovation is through patents. Some companies grow so fast, they become so successful, that their revenue grows faster than they can grow their patent portfolio organically.&#8221; He cited Instacart, which <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-09-Instacart-Acquires-Over-250-Patents-From-IBM">acquired 250 patents from IBM</a> earlier this month, and Airbnb, which was <a href="https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/airbnb-sued-for-patent-infringement-by-ibm/">sued by IBM over patent infringement</a> in early 2020 (the companies <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-and-airbnb-announce-settlement-in-patent-litigation-301198325.html">settled in December</a>), as examples.</p>
<p>ByteDance, thanks to the success of TikTok, now finds itself in a situation where it, too, is likely to become a target of patent trolls. The company has started acquiring patents itself to grow its portfolio faster and now it is joining LOT to strengthen its protection there.</p>
<p>&#8220;[ByteDance] is being a visionary and trying to get ahead of the wave,&#8221; Seddon noted. &#8220;They are a successful global company that needs to develop a global IP strategy. Historically, PAEs were just a U.S. problem, but now ByteDance has to worry about PAEs being an issue in China and Europe as well.  By joining <span class="il">LOT,</span> they protect themselves and their investments from over 3 million patents should they ever fall into the hands of a PAE.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynn-wu-2b587b3a/?originalSubdomain=cn">Lynn Wu</a>, director and chief IP Counsel, Global IP and Digital Licensing Strategy at ByteDance, agrees. &#8220;Innovation is core to the culture at ByteDance, and we believe it’s important to protect our diverse technical and creative community,&#8221; she said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As champions for the fair use of IP, we encourage other companies to help us make the industry safer by joining <span class="il">LOT</span> Network. If we work together, we can protect the industry from exploitation and continue advancing innovation, which is key to the growth and success of the entire community.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another reason companies are so eager to join the group now, though, and that&#8217;s because these patent assertion entities, which had faded into the background a bit in the mid-to late-2010s, may be making a comeback. The core assumption here is a bit gloomy: Many companies seem to assume we&#8217;re in for an economic downturn. If we hit a recession, a lot of patent holders will start looking at their patent portfolios and start selling off some of their more valuable patents in order to stay afloat. Because beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, that often means they&#8217;ll sell to a patent troll if that troll is the highest bidder. Last year, a patent troll sued Uber <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1246739/alleged-troll-sues-uber-using-newly-offloaded-ibm-patents">using a patent sold by IBM</a>, for example (and IBM gets a bit of a bad rap for this, but, hey, it&#8217;s business).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened after the last recession &#8212; though it typically takes a few years for the effect to be felt. Nothing in the patent world moves quickly.</p>
<p>Now, when LOT members sell to a troll, that troll can&#8217;t sue other LOT members over it. Take IBM, for example, which joined LOT last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;People give IBM a lot of grief and criticism for selling to PAEs, but at least IBM is giving everybody a chance to get a free license,&#8221; Seddon told me. &#8220;IBM joined LOT last year and what IBM is effectively doing is saying to everybody, &#8216;look, I joined LOT.&#8217; And they put all of their entire patent portfolio into LOT. And they&#8217;re saying to everybody, &#8216;look, I have the right to sell my patents to anybody I want, and I&#8217;m going to sell it to the highest bidder. And if I sell it to a patent troll and you don&#8217;t join LOT &#8212; and if you get sued by a troll, is that my fault or your fault? Because if you join LOT, you could have gotten a free license.&#8217; &#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to overvalue a startup when the public market is willing to double its valuation the moment it starts to trade.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-valuation-nasdaq-private-market">CoinDesk reported</a> yesterday that crypto trading startup Coinbase is being valued at $77 billion on private exchanges. And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valuing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=7b6c95824786">Forbes reported</a> that Stripe is being valued at $115 billion on secondary markets, where private shares can be bought and sold, albeit in a limited fashion.</p>
<p>I instantly wanted to write a piece headlined &#8220;Beware those super hot secondary market valuations,<em>&#8220;</em> but after a little digging, I cannot. It turns out that the public markets are so hot, there is historical precedent for seemingly aggressive secondary market transactions being conservative compared to later IPO valuations. And there is further precedent for private market transactions that are more conservative in price terms than venture-determined valuations also working out.</p>

<hr />
<p>The hot equities market is making stock pickers out of many startup investors, regardless of whether they are leading priced rounds or buying shares on modern secondary markets.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s explore the new prices for Coinbase and Stripe by starting with a look at their dated private valuations, their new, reported secondary prices and where some companies that went public with notable secondary prices wound up trading today.</p>
<p>This will be fun! I promise!</p>
<h2>Overprice me, I dare you</h2>
<p>Coinbase was last valued by private-market money at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/coinbase-series-e--25f6f746">around $8 billion, per Crunchbase data</a> back in October of 2018. More recently we&#8217;ve seen secondary transactions that value the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1354562917744713734">at $50 billion</a>, other notes concerning <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/14/coinbase-valuation-75-billion-bitcoin-value-cryptocurrency/">a $75 billion possible valuation</a>, and even some enthusiastic chat from a former employee <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/01/29/coinbase-investors-say-it-could-hit-100-billion-valuation-when-it-goes-public/?sh=b05f8fa5b50f">that the company could be worth $100 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Its new $77 billion price tag might seem somewhat pedestrian in that mix, but recall that we&#8217;re largely discussing the valuations associated with Coinbase set by buyers not in the know; retail secondary buyers of shares in the cryptocurrency exchange are probably not its board members.</p>
<p>So, the <em>public</em> is, to some degree, repricing Coinbase. The question is whether those prices make any sense. Hold your answer, we have more work to do.</p>
<p>Stripe at $115 billion on secondary exchanges is perhaps bonkers, or perhaps nothing more than rationality. In its last round, a $600 million Series G that came in mid-2020, Stripe was valued at around $36 billion. And, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">rumored to be raising capital at a $100 billion valuation</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getcensus.com/">Census</a>, a startup that helps businesses sync their customer data from their data warehouses to their various business tools like Salesforce and Marketo, today announced that it has raised a $16 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital.

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Census raises $4.3M seed to put product info in cloud data warehouses to work&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/census-announces-4-3m-seed-to-put-product-info-in-cloud-data-warehouses-to-work/embed/#?secret=IXekrbZ1Dt" data-secret="IXekrbZ1Dt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is part of a new crop of startups that are building on top of data warehouses. The general idea behind Census is to help businesses operationalize the data in their data warehouses, which was traditionally only used for analytics and reporting use cases. But as businesses realized that all the data they needed was already available in their data warehouses and that they could use that as a single source of truth without having to build additional integrations, an ecosystem of companies that operationalize this data started to form.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company argues that the modern data stack, with data warehouses like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery and Snowflake at its core, offers all of the tools a business needs to extract and transform data (like Fivetran, dbt) and then visualize it (think Looker).</p>
<p>Tools like Census then essentially function as a new layer that sits between the data warehouse and the business tools that can help companies extract value from this data. With that, users can easily sync their product data into a marketing tool like Marketo or a CRM service like Salesforce, for example.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years ago, we were the first to ask, &#8216;Why are we relying on a clumsy tangle of wires connecting every app when everything we need is already in the warehouse? What if you could leverage your data team to drive operations?&#8217; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the data warehouse is connected to the rest of the business, the possibilities are limitless,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Census explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we launched, our focus was enabling product-led companies like Figma, Canva, and Notion to drive better marketing, sales, and customer success. Along the way, our customers have pulled Census into more and more scenarios, like auto-prioritizing support tickets in Zendesk, automating invoices in Netsuite, or even integrating with HR systems.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Census already integrates with dozens of different services and data tools and its customers include the likes of Clearbit, Figma, Fivetran, LogDNA, Loom and Notion.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Census plans to use the new funding to launch new features like deeper data validation and a visual query experience. In addition, it also plans to launch code-based orchestration to make Census workflows versionable and make it easier to integrate them into an enterprise orchestration system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A couple of weeks ago SentinelOne announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentinelone-acquires-high-speed-logging-startup-scalyr-for-155m/">acquiring high-speed logging platform Scalyr</a> for $155 million. Just this morning <a href="http://crowdstrike.com">CrowdStrike</a> struck next, announcing it was buying unlimited logging tool <a href="https://www.humio.com/">Humio</a> for $400 million.</p>
<p>In Humio, CrowdStrike gets a company that will provide it with the ability to collect unlimited logging information. Most companies have to pick and choose what to log and how long to keep it, but with Humio, they don&#8217;t have to make these choices, with customers processing multiple terabytes of data every single day.</p>
<p>Humio CEO Geeta Schmidt writing in <a href="https://www.humio.com/humio-crowdstrike">a company blog post announcing the deal</a> described her company in similar terms to Scalyr, a data lake for log information:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Humio had become the data lake for these enterprises enabling searches for longer periods of time and from more data sources allowing them to understand their entire environment, prepare for the unknown, proactively prevent issues, recover quickly from incidents, and get to the root cause,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LRa5LW16G1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity unicorn, files to go public</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity unicorn, files to go public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/embed/#?secret=LRa5LW16G1" data-secret="LRa5LW16G1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That means with Humio in the fold, CrowdStrike can use this massive amount of data to help deal with threats and attacks in real time as they are happening, rather than reacting to them and trying to figure out what happened later, a point by the way that SentinelOne also made when it purchased Scalyr.</p>
<p>&#8220;The combination of real-time analytics and smart filtering built into CrowdStrike’s proprietary Threat Graph and Humio’s blazing-fast log management and index-free data ingestion dramatically accelerates our [eXtended Detection and Response (XDR)] capabilities beyond anything the market has seen to date,&#8221; CrowdStrike CEO and co-founder George Kurtz said in a statement.</p>
<p>While two acquisitions don&#8217;t necessarily make a trend, it&#8217;s clear that security platform players are suddenly seeing the value of being able to process the large amounts of information found in logs, and they are willing to put up some cash to get that capability. It will be interesting to see if any other security companies react with a similar move in the coming months.</p>
<p>Humio was founded in 2016 and raised just over $31 million, according to Pitchbook Data. Its most recent funding round came in March 2020,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/humio-announces-20m-series-b-to-advance-unlimited-logging-tool/"> a $20 million Series B</a> led by Dell Technologies Capital. It would appear to be a decent exit for the startup.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and raised over $480 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">before going public in 2019</a>. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, and is subject to typical regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles is warning of a potential data breach after a contractor was hit by ransomware.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based Automatic Funds Transfer Services (AFTS), which the DMV said it has used for verifying changes of address with the national database since 2019, was hit by an unspecified strain of ransomware earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a statement sent by email, the DMV said that the attack may have compromised &#8220;the last 20 months of California vehicle registration records that contain names, addresses, license plate numbers and vehicle identification numbers.&#8221; But the DMV said AFTS does not have access to customers&#8217; Social Security numbers, dates of birth, voter registration, immigration status or driver&#8217;s license information, and was not compromised.</p>
<p>The DMV said it has since stopped all data transfers to AFTS and has since initiated an emergency contract to prevent any downtime.</p>
<p>AFTS is used across the United States to process payments, invoices and verify addresses. Several <a href="https://www.skagitpud.org/news/pud-aware-of-potential-data-security-issue/">municipalities</a> have <a href="https://awwd.com/impact/emergency-information/afts-inc-security-issue/">already</a> confirmed that they are affected by the <a href="https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Finance-and-Administration/Customer-Accounts/Utility-Billing/AFTS-FAQ">data breach</a>, suggesting it may not be limited to California&#8217;s DMV. But it&#8217;s not known what kind of ransomware hit AFTS. Ransomware typically encrypts a company&#8217;s files and will unlock them in exchange for a ransom. But since many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">companies have backups</a>, some ransomware groups threaten to publish the stolen files online unless the ransom is paid.</p>
<p>AFTS could not be immediately reached for comment. Its website is offline, with a short message: &#8220;The website for AFTS and all related payment processing website <em>[sic] </em>are unavailable due to technical issues. We are working on restoring them as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking at additional measures to implement to bolster security to protect information held by the DMV and companies that we contract with,&#8221; said Steve Gordon, the director of the state&#8217;s DMV.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjekz/the-california-dmv-is-making-dollar50m-a-year-selling-drivers-personal-information">it was reported</a> that California&#8217;s DMV makes more than $50 million a year by selling drivers&#8217; personal information, including <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyzeza/california-dmv-data-private-investigators">to bondsmen and private investigators</a>.</p>
<p>California has more than 35 million registered vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of &#8220;Zoom University&#8221; was only possible because edtech wasn’t ready to address the biggest opportunity of the past year: remote learning at scale. Of course, the term encapsulates more than just Zoom, it’s a nod to how schools had to rapidly adopt enterprise video conferencing software to keep school in session in the wake of closures brought on by the virus’ rapid spread.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a year since students were first sent home because of the coronavirus, a cohort of edtech companies is emerging, emboldened with millions in venture capital, ready to take back the market.</p>
<p>The new wave of startups are slicing and dicing the same market of students and teachers who are fatigued by Zoom University, which &#8212; at best &#8212; often looks like a gallery view with a chat bar. Four of the companies that are gaining traction include <a href="https://www.class.com/">Class</a>, <a href="https://www.engageli.com/">Engageli</a>, <a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a> and <a href="https://inspace.chat/">InSpace</a>. It signals a shift from startups playing in the supplemental education space and searching to win a spot in the largest chunk of a students day: the classroom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While each startup has its own unique strategy and product, the founders behind them all need to answer the same question: Can they make digital learning a preferred mode of pedagogy and comprehension &#8212; and not merely a backup &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">after the pandemic is over</a>?</p>
<p>Answering that question begins with deciding whether videoconferencing is what online, live learning should look like.</p>
<h2>Ground up</h2>
<p>“This is completely grounds up; there is no Zoom, Google Meets or Microsoft Teams anywhere in the vicinity,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-avida/">Dan Avida</a>, co-founder of Engageli, just a few minutes into the demo of his product.</p>
<p>Engageli, a new startup founded by Avida, Daphne Koller, Jamie Nacht Farrell and Serge Plotkin, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/14/engageli-launches-with-14-5-million-to-bring-digital-learning-to-universities/">raised $14.5 million</a> in October to bring digital learning to college universities. The startup wants to make big lecture-style classes feel more intimate, and thinks digitizing everything from the professor monologues to side conversations between students is the way to go.</p>
<p>Engageli is a videoconferencing platform in that it connects students and professors over live video, but the real product feature that differentiates it, according to Avida, is in how it views the virtual classroom.</p>
<p>Upon joining the platform, each student is placed at a virtual table with another small group of students. Within those pods, students can chat, trade notes, screenshot the lecture and collaborate, all while hearing a professor lecture simultaneously.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2114420" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png" alt="" width="683" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png 1448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>“The FaceTime session going on with friends or any other communication platform is going to happen,” Avida said. “So it might as well run it through our platform.”</p>
<p>The tables can easily be scrambled to promote different conversation or debates, and teachers can pop in and out without leaving their main screen. It’s a riff on Zoom’s breakout rooms, which let participants jump into separate calls within a bigger call.</p>
<p>There’s also a notetaking feature that allows students to screenshot slides and live annotate them within the Engageli platform. Each screenshot comes with a hyperlink that will take the student back to the live recording of that note, which could help with studying.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be better than Zoom, we want to be different than Zoom,” Avida said. Engageli can run on a variety of products of differing bandwidth, from Chromebooks to iPads and PCs.</p>
<p>Engageli is feature-rich to the point that it has to onboard teachers, its main customer, in two phases, a process that can take over an hour. While Avida says that it only takes five minutes to figure out how to use the platform to hold a class, it does take longer to figure out how to fully take advantage of all the different modules. Teachers and students need to have some sort of digital savviness to be able to use the platform, which is both a barrier to entry for adoption but also a reason why Engageli can tout that it&#8217;s better than a simple call. Complexity, as Avida sees it, requires well-worth-it time.</p>
<p>The startup’s ambition doesn’t block it from dealing with contract issues. Other video conferencing platforms can afford to be free or already have been budgeted into. Engageli currently charges $9.99 or less per student seat for its platform. Avida says that with Zoom, “it’s effectively free because people have already paid for it, so we have to demonstrate why we’re much better than those products.”</p>
<p>Engageli’s biggest hurdle is another startup’s biggest advantage.</p>
<h2>Built on top of Zoom</h2>
<p>Class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">launched less than a year ago</a> by Blackboard co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasen">Michael Chasen</a>, integrates exclusively with Zoom to offer a more customized classroom for students and teachers alike. The product, currently in private paid beta, helps teachers launch live assignments, track attendance and understand student engagement levels in real time.</p>
<p>While positioning an entire business on Zoom could lead to platform risk, Chasen sees it as a competitive advantage that will help the startup stay relevant after the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re not really pitching it as pandemic-related,” Chasen said. “No school has only said that we’re going to plan to use this for a month, and very few K-12 schools say we’re only looking at this in case a pandemic comes again.” Chasen says that most beta customers say online learning will be part of their instructional strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Investors clearly see the opportunity in the company’s strategy, from distribution to execution. Earlier this month, Class announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/class-series-a-zoom/">it had raised $30 million in Series A financing</a>, just 10 weeks after raising a $16 million seed round. Raising that much pre-launch gives the startup key wiggle room, but it also gives validation: a number of Zoom’s earliest investors, including Emergence Capital and Bill Tai, who wrote the first check into Zoom, have put money into Class.</p>
<p>“At Blackboard, we had a six to nine month sales cycle; we’d have to explain that e-learning is a thing,” Chasen said, who was at the LMS business for 15 years. “[With Class] we don’t even have to pitch. It wraps up in a month, and our sales cycle is just showing people the product.</p>

<p>Unlike Engageli, Class is selling to both K-12 institutions and higher-education institutions, which means its product is more focused on access and ease of use instead of specialized features. The startup has over 6,000 institutions, from high schools to higher education institutions, on the waitlist to join.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108367" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108367" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2108367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png" alt="" width="650" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png 1004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Class</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Class software is only usable on Macs, but its beta will be available on iPhone, Windows and Android in the near future. The public launch is at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>“K-12 is in a bigger bind,” he said, but higher-ed institutions are fully committed to using synchronous online learning for the “long haul.”</p>
<p>“Higher-ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they&#8217;re now taking the next step,” he said. “Whereas with a lot of K-12, I&#8217;m actually seeing that this is the first step that they&#8217;re taking.”</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually, depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>
<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” he said. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they’re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.”</p>
<h2>Asynchronously, silly</h2>
<p>Engageli and Class are both trying to innovate on the live learning experience, but Top Hat, which raised $130 million in a Series E round<a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/02/top-hat-raises-130m-in-series-e-funding.html#"> this past week</a>, thinks that the future is pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>Top Hat digitizes textbooks, but instead of putting a PDF on a screen, the startup fits features such as polls and interactive graphics in the text. The platform has attracted millions of students on this premise.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a lot of companies putting emphasis on creating a virtual classroom,” he said. “But replicating the same thing in a different medium is never a good idea…nobody wants to stare at a screen and then have the restraint of having to show up at a previous pre-prescribed time.”</p>
<p><a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/top-hat-launches-community/#:~:text=TORONTO%20%E2%80%94%20July%2030%2C%202020%20%E2%80%94,communicate%2C%20collaborate%2C%20and%20build%20connections">In July</a>, Top Hat launched <a href="https://tophat.com/features/community/">Community</a> to give teachers a way to make class more than just a YouTube video. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">Similar to ClassDojo,</a> Community provides a space for teachers and students to converse and stay up to date on shared materials. The interface also allows students to create private channels to discuss assignments and work on projects, as well as direct message their teachers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will edtech empower or erase the need for higher education?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/embed/#?secret=987ODe3Rz9" data-secret="987ODe3Rz9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CEO Mike Silagadze says that Top Hat tried a virtual classroom tool early on, and “very quickly learned that it was fundamentally just the wrong strategy.” His mindset contrasts with the demand that Class and Engageli have proven so far, to which Silagadze says might not be as long-term as they think.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s definitely a lot of interest that&#8217;s generated in people signing up to beta lists and like wanting to try it out. But when people really get into it, everyone pretty much drops off and focuses more on asynchronous, small and in-person groups.”</p>
<p>Instead, the founder thinks that “schools are going to double down on the really valuable in-person aspects of higher education that they couldn&#8217;t provide before” and deliver other content, like large lecture-style classes or meetings, through asynchronous content delivery.</p>
<p>This is similar to what Jeff Maggioncalda, the CEO of Coursera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/">told TechCrunch in November:</a> Colleges are going to re-invest in their in-person and residential experiences, and begin offering credentials and content online to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve been on the journey to create a more and more complete platform that our customers can use since almost day one,” Silagadze said. “What the pandemic has brought is much more comprehensive testing functionality that Top Hat has rolled out and better communication tooling so basically better chat and communication tooling for professors.”</p>
<p>TopHat costs $30 per semester, per student. Currently Top Hat has most of its paying customers coming in through its content offering, the digital textbooks, instead of this learning platform.</p>
<h2>College spin-out</h2>
<p><a href="https://inspace.chat/">InSpace</a>, a startup spinning out of Champlain college, is similarly focused on making the communication between professors and students more natural. <a href="https://www.champlain.edu/academics/our-faculty/hall-narine">Dr. Narine Hall</a>, the founder of the startup, is a professor herself who just wanted class to “feel more natural&#8221; when it was being conducted.</p>
<p>InSpace is similar to some of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">virtual HQ platforms</a> that have popped up over the past few months. The platforms, which my colleague Devin Coldewey aptly dubbed Sims for Enterprise, are trying to create the feel of an office or classroom online but without a traditional gallery view or conference call vibe. The potential success of inSpace and others could signal how the future of work will blend gaming and socialization for distributed teams.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvhJbVm3t54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>InSpace is using spatial gaming infrastructure to create spontaneity. The technology allows users to only hear people within their nearby proximity, and get quieter as they walk, or click, away. When applied to a virtual world, spatial technology can give the feeling of a hallway bump-in.</p>
<p>Similar to Engageli, inSpace is rethinking how an actual class is conducted. In inSpace, students don&#8217;t have to leave the main call to have a conversation during inSpace, which they do in Zoom. Students can just toggle over to their own areas and a professor can see teamwork being done in real time. When a student has a question, their bubble becomes bigger, which is easier to track than the hand-raise feature, says Hall.</p>
<p>InSpace has a different monetization strategy than other startups. It charges $15 a month per-educator or “host” versus per-student, which Hall says was so educators could close contracts “as fast as possible.” Hall agrees with other founders that schools have a high demand for the product, but she says that the decision-making process around buying new tooling continues to be difficult in schools with tight budgets, even amid a pandemic. There are currently 100 customers on the platform.</p>
<p>So far, Hall sees inSpace working best with classes that include 25 people, with a max of 50 people.</p>
<p>The company was born out of her own frustrations as a teacher. In grad school, Hall worked on research that combined proximity-based interactions with humans. When August rolled around and she needed a better solution than WebEx or Zoom, she turned to that same research and began building code atop of her teachings. It led to inSpace, which recently announced that it has landed $2.5 million in financing led by Boston Seed Capital.</p>

<p>The differences between each startup, from strategy to monetization to its view of the competition, are music to Zoom’s ears. Anne Keough Keehn, who was hired as Zoom’s Global Education Lead just nine months ago, says that the platform has a “very open attitude and policy about looking at how we best integrate&#8230;and sometimes that’s going to be a co-opetition.”</p>
<p>“In the past there has been too much consolidation and therefore it limits choices,” Keehn said. “And we know everybody in education likes to have choices.” Zoom will be used differently in a career office versus a class, and in a happy hour versus a wedding; the platform sees opportunity in it all beyond the “monolithic definition” that video-conferencing has had for so long.</p>
<p>And, despite the fact that this type of response is expected by a well-trained executive at a big company in the spotlight, maybe Keehn is onto something here: Maybe the biggest opportunity in edtech right now is that there is opportunity and money in the first place, for remote learning, for better video-conferencing and for more communication.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: A previous version of this story claims that TopHat&#8217;s community platform cost $30 per student, per month. TopHat has clarified since that the community platform is free, but its core product is sold for this cost. An update has been made to reflect this clarification.</em></p>
