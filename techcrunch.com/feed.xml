										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is trying out some changes to the way that users report tweets that they believe might break Twitter&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>Like most social media companies, Twitter has long relied on user reporting to flag potentially policy-violating tweets. But in its new imagining of that system those reports would provide the company with a richer picture of behavior on the platform rather than just a way to evaluate individual incidents in isolation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244232" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244232" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=2048,1053 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Twitter-Reporting-Flow-Update-12.6.21.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Twitter is currently testing the new system with a small test group of U.S. users but has plans to release it to a broader swath of the platform starting in 2022. That system replacing the existing prompts that Twitter users see when they opt to report content on the platform.</p>
<p>One of the biggest<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> changes is that users will no longer be asked to specify which of Twitter&#8217;s policies they believe a tweet is violating — instead, they offer information and Twitter uses automated systems to suggest what rule a given tweet might be breaking. </span></p>
<p>The user that reported a tweet can either accept that suggestion or say that it isn&#8217;t right — feedback that Twitter can further use to hone its reporting systems. The company likens this to the difference between going to the doctor and describing your symptoms vs. self diagnosing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can be frustrating and complex about reporting is that we enforce based on terms of service violations as defined by the Twitter Rules,&#8221; Renna Al-Yassini, Senior UX Manager on the team said. &#8220;The vast majority of what people are reporting on fall within a much larger gray spectrum that don&#8217;t meet the specific criteria of Twitter violations, but they&#8217;re still reporting what they are experiencing as deeply problematic and highly upsetting.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter hopes to collect and analyze reports that fall into that gray area, using it to give the company a snapshot of problem behavior on the platform. Ideally, Twitter can identify emerging trends in harassment, misinformation, hate speech and other problem areas as they emerge, rather than after they&#8217;ve already taken root. The company declined to comment on if the changes would require hiring more human moderators, stating that it would use a blend of human and automated moderation to process the information.</p>
<p>The company also wants to improve the reporting process for users, &#8220;closing the loop&#8221; and making the reporting process more meaningful, even if a given tweet doesn&#8217;t prompt enforcement action. The new system aims to resolve some common complaints that the company identified through research on how to make the platform safer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It helps us address unknown unknowns,&#8221; said Fay Johnson, Twitter&#8217;s director of product management on the health team. &#8220;&#8230; We also want to make sure that if there are new issues that are emerging — ones that we may not have rules for yet — there is a method for us to learn about them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Snap&#8217;s creators begin to experiment with the company&#8217;s augmented reality Spectacles hardware, the company is delving deeper into juicing the capabilities of its Lens Studio to build augmented reality filters which are more connected, more realistic and more futuristic. At the company&#8217;s annual Lens Fest event, Snap debuted a number of changes coming to their lens creation suite. Changes range from efforts to integrate outside media and data to more AR-centric features designed with a glasses-future in mind.</p>
<p>On the media side, Snap will be debuting a news sounds library which will allow creators to add audio clips and millions of songs from Snapchat&#8217;s library of licensed music directly into their lenses. Snap is also making efforts to bring real-time data into Lenses via an API library that showcase evolving trends like weather information from Accuweather or cryptocurrency prices from FTX. One of the bigger feature updates will allow users to embed links inside lenses and send them to different web pages.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244224" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244224" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244224" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Sounds-Library.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244224" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Snap</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snap&#8217;s once-goofy selfie filters remain a big growth opportunity for the company which has long had augmented reality in its sights. Snap detailed that there are now more than 2.5 million lenses that have been built by more than a quarter-million creators. Those lenses have been viewed by users a collective 3.5 trillion times, the company says. The company is building out its own internal &#8220;AR innovation lab,&#8221; called Ghost, which will help the company bankroll Lens designers who are looking to push the limits of what&#8217;s possible, dishing out grants for up to $150k for individual projects.</p>
<p>As the company looks to make lenses smarter, they&#8217;re also looking to. make them more technically capable.</p>
<p>Beyond integrating new data types, Snap is also looking at the underlying AR tech to help make for enjoyable lenses for users with lower-end phones. Its World Mesh feature has allowed users with higher-end phones to leverage AR and view lenses that integrate more real world geometry data for digital objects in a lens to interact with. Now, Snap is enabling this feature across more basic phones as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244225" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244225" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244225" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lens-Studio-Real-World-Physics.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244225" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Snap</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, Snap is also rolling out tools to make digital objects react more realistically in reference to each other, debuting an in-lens physics engine which will allow for more dynamic lenses that can not only interact more deeply with the real world but can adjust to simultaneous user input as well.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s efforts to create more sophisticated lens creation tools on mobile come as the company is also looking to build out more future-flung support for the tools developers may need to design for hands-free glasses experiences on its new AR Spectacles. Creators have been crafting experiences with the new hardware for months and Snap has been building new lens functionality to address their concerns and spark up new opportunities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244229" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244229" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244229 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Andre-Elijah-Portrait.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244229" class="wp-caption-text">Image:Snap</p></div></p>
<p>Ultimately, Snap&#8217;s glasses are still firmly in developer mode and the company hasn&#8217;t offered any timelines for when they might ship a consumer product with integrated AR capabilities, so they theoretically have plenty of time to build to build in the background.</p>
<p>Some of the tools Snap has been quietly building include Connected Lenses which enable shared experiences inside Lenses so multiple users can interact with the same content using AR Spectacles. In their developer iteration, the AR Spectacles don&#8217;t have the longest battery life, meaning that Snap has had to get creative in ensuring that Snap&#8217;s are there when you need them without running persistently. The company&#8217;s Endurance mode allows lenses to continue running in the background off-display while waiting for a specific trigger like reaching a certain GPS location.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finding the right therapist is never an easy task, but it gets even harder when, as a person of color or someone with disabilities, there are few or no people sharing your experience available. <a href="https://therify.co/">Therify</a> hopes to change that with a network of providers from and catering to marginalized populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just makes a ton of sense,&#8221; co-founder James Edward Murray told me. I felt the same way after seeing Murray pitch his company during Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 demo day. The problem is super simple: not everyone can find therapists they feel comfortable with, since the process of finding one isn&#8217;t particularly convenient to begin with, and when you add in some important personal preferences, it can be nigh impossible.</p>
<p>Murray, who is Black, said his instinct in looking for a therapist was to find a Black woman, like those who raised him and with whom he feels comfortable and vulnerable. But after accounting for other factors, like timing, availability, and therapeutic approach, he ended up with only a handful of options. It didn&#8217;t feel right to him that there should be so few people that shared his background available to him through the system he was working in.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I talked with other people, co-workers of color, co-workers with disabilities&#8230; it became clear that there was a gap here,&#8221; he said — and he immediately got to work on filling it. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t originally want to start a business — I just had a Google form and was matching people, over a hundred, with culturally sensitive therapists. My company came to me and said, hey, can we build this into our benefits?</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when I thought, &#8216;hmmm&#8230;&#8217; this has value.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murray teamed up with CTO Warren Sadler, who worked in machine learning in the health sector, after &#8220;begging&#8221; him to start the company together.</p>

<p>Therify essentially aggregates the supply of providers, usually those with large group practices, and who belong to or specialize in working with people who might find it hard to find a therapist like themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started the company, because I&#8217;m Black I wanted to serve my community, but as I started the work I saw that the opportunity is so much broader than that,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;So we focused on anyone who feels underrepresented. It&#8217;s not just Black and Latinx employees, it&#8217;s Asian employees, it&#8217;s LGBTQ+ employees, veteran employees, everyone with marginalized identities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So someone can log into Therify and say they focus on anxiety and CBT in LA, and are South Asian and understand the South Asian family experience,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They understand your identity and particular experience — without that piece, it&#8217;s incomplete.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therify works with employee-provided benefits as a layer in between the users or members and covered providers, connecting people with specific needs or wants to therapists who can provide that. They also cover the first few sessions to ease the process of matching, and provide additional group formats to overcome obstacles felt particularly by some groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therapy is stigmatized in some communities,&#8221; Murray pointed out. &#8220;A group oriented format you can join anonymously, focused on overcoming imposter syndrome at work, or dealing with race-related trauma, it works in favor of people with marginalized communities who are super impacted by that stigma. It provides an alternative to actually going into a room for a one on one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therify signed up hundreds of providers in the first six months, partly due to the company&#8217;s modern payment stack — therapists and other providers often have to wait weeks or months for payments, and as Murray pointed out many in marginalized communities work on a sliding scale as well, but Therify guarantees market rate and direct deposit.</p>
<p>Of course the huge digital shift in the therapy industry has helped make this possible. But companies are also realizing that this kind of benefit is an important aspect of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, which helps with buy-in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mental health is a DEI problem: employees from under-represented backgrounds are more likely to leave their jobs, to report mental health symptoms, to report work related mental health issues. It&#8217;s a leaky bucket,&#8221; Murray explained. &#8220;Companies are putting all this effort into DEI but not building the infrastructure needed not just to attract but to keep a diverse group of employees. I experienced this myself at Facebook, and I&#8217;m not the only one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $1.3M seed round is led by SoftBank&#8217;s SB Opportunity Fund, Looking Glass Capital, Y Combinator of course, Flexport, True Culture Fund, and K5 Global, plus a raft of individual investors including former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao.</p>
<p>Murray said the money will power the buildout of Therify&#8217;s provider network and sales channels. In addition, the 18-month plan involves moving into Canada, Europe, and southeast Asia. That naturally involves a lot of legal and compliance work, but fortunately the product itself will translate fairly easily. Video call therapy has gone from niche to default and systems to support it are widely available — good news for a company hoping to scale globally.</p>
<p>As the company grows and serves more populations the hope is it will also serve those populations better. The more providers and customers join the system, the more easily and accurately it can match them together. Everybody should be able to get the kind of mental health treatment they deserve, and this is a step in the right direction to make sure that&#8217;s not just possible but easy and simple for all involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The launch sector is getting crowded. Many of the biggest players are building their own rocket engines, but space startup <a href="https://www.ursamajor.com/">Ursa Major</a> is betting that many new launch providers would rather outsource the engine than build it in-house.</p>
<p>Six years after being founded by former SpaceX and Blue Origin propulsion engineer Joe Laurienti, the company is ready to scale up its ambitions, and it just closed its largest funding round to date to do so: an $85 million Series C led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, as well as participation from XN, Alsop Louie, Alpha Edison, Dolby Family Ventures, KCK, Space Capital, Explorer 1, Harpoon Ventures, and others.</p>
<p>“A lot of a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to bring to market is that next step,” Laurienti explained. “We want to evolve this industry into much faster life cycles.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To get there, Ursa Major wants to rapidly manufacture engines – as many as one per week in 2022, with two per week to follow. (Currently, it takes a single employee around five days to assemble an engine and up to a few weeks to get it ready to ship to customers.) The company has scored a handful of commercial customers, including Phantom Space and Stratolaunch, and R&amp;D contracts with the government, though its engines have yet to see space.</p>
<p>“It made sense even six years ago that there was going to be a pretty complex ecosystem to launch because space was going to need so much accessibility,” Laurienti said. While the cost to launch has declined, the demand for space launch services is only expected to increase through the rest of the decade. <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/space-launch-services-market-101931">Fortune Business Insights</a> estimates that the global market size for launch will grow from $12.67 billion in 2019 to up to $26.16 billion by 2027.</p>
<p>But rocket engines are one of the most challenging pieces of equipment to develop; one only has to look to Blue Origin’s bumpy efforts to develop BE-4 engines for United Launch Alliance – or Elon Musk’s letter to employees about a “Raptor production crisis” – to see that engine development is no easy task.</p>
<p>The company has two products: the Hadley, a 5,000-pound thrust liquid oxygen and kerosene engine which is entering production now; and the Ripley, the next-gen engine that’s 10 times more powerful than Hadley with a 50,000-pound thrust. The company is booked to deliver over 50 Hadley engines next year, with the Ripley coming into production in the next couple of years, Laurienti said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He likened Ursa Major to a company like Intel, which is constantly innovating more powerful processors and outsourcing that expertise to brands like Dell and Lenovo. “We really like the notion that we are a technology development company, and the companies that are flying rockets today should not be flying the same engine that they architected for their rocket 10 years ago. That&#8217;s the paradigm we see in vertical integration.”</p>
<p>The company has a facility in Colorado where it makes the engines, which are largely 3D printed, and that’s collocated with the company’s three test stands where each engine is tested before it sees a customer. Ursa Major is planning on using the new capital to scale up its manufacturing operations and to begin development on additional engines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is suing two Russian individuals it claims are behind a sophisticated botnet operation that has silently infiltrated more than 1 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/windows/">Windows</a> machines worldwide.</p>
<p>In a complaint filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Google names Russian nationals Dmitry Starovikov and Alexander Filippov as the two main operators of the Glupteba botnet, citing Gmail and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Google Workspace</a> accounts they allegedly created to help them operate the criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>Google claims the defendants used the botnet network &#8211; which it describes as a &#8220;modern, borderless technological embodiment of organized crime” &#8211; for illicit purposes, including the theft and unauthorized use of Google users’ logins and account information. It’s demanding that Starovikov and Filippov pay damages and are permanently banned from using Google services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Glupteba botnet, which the tech giant has been tracking since 2020, has so far infected approximately 1 million Windows machines worldwide, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/">Google</a>, and is growing at a rate of thousands of new devices each day. Once a device has been infected &#8211; typically by tricking users into downloading malware via third party “free download” sites &#8211; the botnet steals user credentials and data, secretly mines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>, and sets up proxies to funnel other people’s internet traffic through infected machines and routers.</p>
<p>“At any moment, the power of the Glupteba botnet could be used in a powerful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack or distributed denial of service attack,” Google added in its complaint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The tech giant also notes that the Glupteba botnet stands out compared to conventional botnets due to its “technical sophistication,” which sees it utilize <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology to protect itself from disruption, Google said in the complaint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As well as the launching litigation against the so-called Glupteba botnet, the company’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) &#8211; which has observed the botnet targeting victims in the U.S., India, Brazil, Vietnam and Southeast Asia &#8211; announced it has worked with internet hosting providers to disrupt the botnet’s key command and control (C2) infrastructure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This means its operators no longer have control of the botnet, though Google has warned that Glupteba could return due to the fact it uses blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The Glupteba botnet does not rely solely on predetermined (web) domains to ensure its survival,” Google wrote in its complaint. “Instead, when the botnet’s C2 server is interrupted, Glupteba malware is hard-coded to ‘search’ the public Bitcoin blockchain for transactions involving three specific Bitcoin addresses that are controlled by the Glupteba Enterprise. Thus, the Glupteba botnet cannot be eradicated entirely without neutralizing its blockchain-based infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move, which marks the first time Google has taken action against a botnet operation, comes a day after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/microsoft-seizes-control-of-websites-used-by-china-backed-hackers/">Microsoft revealed that it has seized control of malicious websites being used by China-backed hackers</a> to target governments and human rights organisations in the U.S. and 28 other countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon CTO Werner Vogels has been in his job for 16 years, but the 63-year-old isn&#8217;t quite ready to retire. &#8220;There is so much more to do. I&#8217;m not finished yet,&#8221; he told me during an interview at the company&#8217;s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas last week. &#8220;We&#8217;re having an absolute ball with all the things that we&#8217;re doing. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s a dream job.&#8221; He noted how the percentage of IT spend that goes to the cloud is still minimal, &#8220;and then from a technology side &#8212; oh man &#8212; there&#8217;s so much more in the pipeline, so I&#8217;m not going anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>With re:Invent, Amazon placed a substantial bet on the return to in-person conferences. Typically, the show&#8217;s more than 60,000 attendees take over the Las Vegas Strip for a week. This year, there were about 27,000 attendees, which would still make it one of the largest tech conferences in any pre-COVID year, too.</p>
<p>The conference was also the first AWS event with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamselipsky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Selipsky</a> at the helm of the organization, with its long-time AWS CEO Andy Jassy now in Jeff Bezos&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/today-is-day-1-for-andy-jassy-as-former-aws-ceo-moves-to-amazon-corner-office/">CEO role</a> on the retail side of Amazon. Selipsky did not use the event to announce any major changes in AWS&#8217; strategy, as some had hoped. And maybe that&#8217;s no surprise. According to Vogels, there haven&#8217;t been any major changes under the new leadership yet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I knew Adam, of course, for a long time over the years. He joined us in the second year of AWS, maybe the first year, and then went off, of course, to do Tableau &#8212; and now he&#8217;s back. So that&#8217;s good. But, of course, he intimately knows the business,&#8221; Vogels said, and also noted that Selipsky and Jassy had long worked closely together before Selipsky took the CEO position at Tableau. &#8220;<span class="">It&#8217;s</span> <span class="">just</span> <span class="">continuation,</span> <span class="">just</span> <span class="">business a</span><span class="">s</span> <span class="">usual.</span> <span class="">Of</span> <span class="">course,</span> <span class="">the</span> <span class="">world</span> <span class="">around</span> <span class="">us</span> <span class="">is</span> <span class="">changing</span> and I think <span class="">there&#8217;s</span> <span class="">lots</span> <span class="">of</span> <span class="">sensitivities</span> that he definitely has <span class="">to</span> <span class="">deal</span> <span class="">with</span> &#8212; <span class="">and</span> <span class="">the</span> <span class="">same</span> <span class="">goes</span> <span class="">for</span> <span class="">AWS.</span> <span class="">I</span> <span class="">mean,</span> <span class="">this</span> <span class="">is</span> <span class="">not</span> <span class="">a</span> <span class="">business</span> <span class="">that</span> <span class="">is</span> <span class="">sort</span> <span class="active">of</span> <span class=" ">riding</span> <span class=" ">off</span> <span class=" ">into</span> <span class=" ">the</span> <span class=" ">sunset</span> <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">resting</span> <span class=" ">on</span> laurels <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">just</span> <span class=" ">do</span> <span class=" ">nothing. That is a business that continues to innovate and is also innovating itself.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>During his keynote, Vogels noted how AWS now has hundreds of different services. Jokingly, he blamed the company&#8217;s customers for that, who keep asking for more. But that&#8217;s also becoming a real problem, as it gets harder and harder for businesses to decide which service to use. AWS, Vogels noted, believes in building primitives, not frameworks. &#8220;B<span class=" ">ut</span> <span class=" ">also,</span> <span class=" ">I</span> <span class=" ">think</span> we have the chance &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen this in the past years &#8212; <span class="">to</span> <span class="">build</span> <span class="">more</span> <span class="">solutions,</span> <span class="">to</span> <span class="">build</span> <span class="">more</span> <span class="">packaged</span> <span class=" ">things</span> <span class=" ">for</span> <span class=" ">our</span> <span class=" ">customers.</span> T<span class=" ">here</span> <span class=" ">is</span> <span class=" ">a</span> <span class=" ">certain</span> <span class=" ">very</span> <span class=" ">large</span> <span class=" ">builder&#8217;s</span> <span class=" ">side</span> <span class=" ">of</span> <span class=" ">AWS</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">still</span> likes the tweaking <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">putting</span> <span class=" ">things</span> <span class=" ">together</span> <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">things</span> <span class=" ">like</span> <span class=" ">that, but there&#8217;s also a significant portion of our customers that just want a data lake,&#8221; he said. And some of those are the internal customers at AWS that take these primitives like AWS Glue, the company&#8217;s managed serverless data integration service, to build other solutions (and the feedback cycle from these internal teams, of course, is very fast).</span></p>
<p>Almost by default, for every service, there&#8217;s a long list of new features that users want &#8212; and then there&#8217;s the development team&#8217;s roadmap. Often, Vogels noted, AWS changes that roadmap based on how customers are using a service. With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DynamoDB</a>, AWS&#8217;s NoSQL key-value database, the team knew customers would want secondary indices. &#8220;But we decided to launch without, mostly to understand exactly how customers would start to use these databases. It was already on our roadmap, but customers actually wanted cell- and row-level security much more than secondary indices, so you allow your customers to change your roadmap and I think that&#8217;s just a healthier approach,&#8221; explained Vogels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another kind of customer, Vogels explained, is large, traditional enterprises that are still trying to figure out not just the technological part of moving to the cloud but also everything else around that. How do you build the organizational structure around that. That&#8217;s where AWS&#8217;s partner network comes in, but more and more, they are also asking AWS for help with these cultural changes directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, the main drivers for migrating to the cloud were about developer productivity and moving beyond owning hardware. &#8220;These days, the number one [reason] is security,&#8221; Vogels noted. &#8220;Many organizations &#8212; and definitely the larger enterprises &#8212; start to realize they cannot protect themselves. They cannot make these kinds of investments, but AWS can make them for them. And as such, it becomes a major driver for transitioning in the cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a difference from only a few years ago, when enterprises still worried quite a bit about security in the cloud and often saw it as a potential hurdle to migrating. Vogels believes that was mostly FUD. &#8220;<span class=" ">Well,</span> <span class=" ">you</span> <span class=" ">know,</span> <span class=" ">there</span> <span class=" ">is</span> <span class=" ">just</span> <span class=" ">this</span> <span class=" ">thing</span> <span class=" ">called</span> FUD &#8212; fear, <span class=" ">uncertainty</span> <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">doubt &#8212; a </span><span class="">marketing</span> <span class="">approach</span> <span class="">put</span> <span class="">into</span> <span class="">the</span> <span class="">world</span> <span class="">by</span> <span class="">your</span> <span class="">competitors</span> <span class="">who</span> <span class="">prefer</span> <span class="">to</span> <span class="active">actually</span> <span class=" ">spread</span> <span class=" ">lies </span><span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">introduce</span> <span class=" ">fear</span> <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">uncertainty</span> <span class=" ">in</span> <span class=" ">the</span> <span class=" ">story</span> <span class=" ">instead</span> <span class=" ">of</span> <span class=" ">working</span> <span class=" ">on</span> <span class=" ">building</span> <span class=" ">better</span> <span class=" ">products</span><span class=" ">.</span> <span class=" ">I</span> <span class=" ">think</span> <span class=" ">a</span> <span class=" ">very</span> <span class=" ">significant</span> <span class=" ">portion</span> <span class=" ">of</span> <span class=" ">this</span> <span class=" ">is</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">all</span> <span class=" ">standard</span> IT companies were, &#8216;<span class=" ">really</span> you&#8217;re going to buy servers <span class=" ">from</span> <span class=" ">a</span> <span class=" ">bookshop?</span> How <span class=" ">crazy c</span><span class=" ">an</span> <span class=" ">you</span> <span class=" ">be?</span> W<span class=" ">ell,</span> <span class=" ">it</span> <span class=" ">turns</span> <span class=" ">out</span> <span class=" ">everybody</span> wants servers <span class=" ">from</span> a <span class=" ">bookshop.</span> P<span class=" ">eople</span> <span class=" ">didn&#8217;t</span> <span class=" ">realize</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">Amazon</span> had been a technology <span class=" ">company</span> <span class=" ">from</span> day one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vogels himself, he said, had a very primitive view of AWS before he joined the company. When the company first invited him to give a talk while he was still an academic, he wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of Amazon. And indeed, he noted that hiring engineers was actually one of the biggest challenges in the early days of the service. &#8220;O<span class="">ne</span> <span class="">glimpse</span> <span class="">at</span> <span class="">the</span> <span class="">kitchen, h</span><span class="">owever,</span> <span class="active">and</span> <span class=" ">I</span> <span class=" ">realized</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">anything</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">was</span> <span class=" ">in</span> <span class=" ">the</span> distributed <span class=" ">systems</span> <span class=" ">textbook</span> <span class=" ">was</span> <span class=" ">happening</span> <span class=" ">at</span> <span class=" ">Amazon &#8212; b</span><span class=" ">ut</span> <span class=" ">at</span> <span class=" ">scale,</span> <span class=" ">and</span> <span class=" ">at</span> a <span class=" ">scale</span> <span class=" ">that</span> <span class=" ">I</span> <span class=" ">had</span> <span class=" ">never</span> <span class=" ">seen</span> <span class=" ">before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For security in the cloud, people had the same misunderstandings in the early days. And while there&#8217;s the genuine kind of misunderstanding that Vogels himself had about the scale of Amazon, he noted that there&#8217;s a second kind, too. &#8220;There is <span class="">the</span> <span class="">mischievous</span> <span class="">misunderstanding</span> <span class="">of</span> <span class="active">your</span> <span class=" ">competitors,&#8221; he said.</span> &#8220;<span class=" ">I</span> <span class=" ">remember</span> <span class=" ">one</span> <span class=" ">of</span> <span class=" ">our</span> competitors who is now <span class=" ">a</span> <span class=" ">really</span> <span class=" ">good</span> <span class=" ">partner, </span><span class=" ">in</span> <span class=" ">those</span> <span class=" ">days, they</span> <span class=" ">actually</span> had <span class=" ">sales</span> <span class=" ">meetings</span> <span class=" ">and</span> they <span class=" ">said,</span> &#8216;<span class=" ">who</span> <span class=" ">would</span> <span class=" ">ever</span> <span class=" ">want</span> <span class=" ">to</span> <span class=" ">buy</span> servers from Amazon<span class=" ">? It&#8217;s ridiculous. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8217; Things are different now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>When you talk to large enterprise CIOs, CTOs and other decision-makers, they often talk about wanting to be multi-cloud in order to get the best of what the various hyper clouds have to offer. All of the major cloud vendors, including AWS, now offer one kind of service or another to enable this, using their technology to run and manage containers and services on their competitors&#8217; clouds. In reality, I&#8217;m not seeing a lot of companies actually doing this, though, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/why-sabre-is-betting-against-multi-cloud/">more and more</a>, I hear companies say that this just locks them into the lowest common denominator. That&#8217;s something Vogels also echoed.</p>

<p>He argued that customers, just like they would when evaluating any other service, want to have an exit strategy. In practice, that may mean going with a single cloud provider, but architecting a system that would make it easier to move to another cloud if that ever becomes necessary.</p>
<p>For a lot of companies, migrating to the cloud still means lifting and shifting their existing services. Increasingly, though, it also means they can start to look at new development patterns. During his keynote, Vogels put a special emphasis on using serverless patterns, and indeed, he thinks that it should be something of the default going forward. &#8220;If you&#8217;re building from scratch, then yes,&#8221; he said when I asked him about this. But he also noted that there are, in essence, three different compute platforms today: instances, containers and serverless. Your SAP system, you&#8217;ll likely move to a specialized instance on EC2. Your homegrown tools that you can decompose into smaller blocks would make a good candidate for containers and Kubernetes. And then, for completely new services, serverless would be a good candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="">Interesting</span> <span class="">enough,</span> <span class="">I</span> <span class="">always</span> <span class="">thought</span> <span class="">when</span> <span class="">we</span> <span class="">launched</span> <span class="">[AWS&#8217; serverless platform] </span><span class="">Lambda,</span> <span class="">I</span> <span class="">thought</span> <span class="">that </span><span class=" ">the</span> <span class=" ">young</span> <span class=" ">entrepreneurs,</span> <span class=" ">the</span> <span class=" ">digital</span> <span class=" ">guys</span> <span class=" ">will</span> <span class=" ">be</span> hung-ho over it. <span class=" ">It</span> <span class=" ">turns</span> <span class=" ">out,</span> t<span class=" ">he</span> <span class=" ">biggest</span> <span class=" ">users</span> <span class=" ">of</span> Lambda <span class=" ">became</span> <span class=" ">enterprises,&#8221; Vogel noted and argued that this is likely because serverless gives them more control over their cost. </span></p>
<p>He also noted that there is a sustainability argument to be made for serverless, which doesn&#8217;t consume any resources while a service is idle. AWS made sustainability <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sustainability-pillar-well-architected-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sixth pillar of its well-architected framework last week</a>, as Vogels announced during his keynote. AWS believes in a shared responsibility model for cloud sustainability, with the company planning to run its operations on 100% renewable energy by 2025. But at the same time, it&#8217;s also up to the users to figure out how to most efficiently use the cloud, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I try to motivate my customers to start thinking about what they could do and not only think about technology, but what if you have, maybe a website that&#8217;s just a little bit less rich? Maybe your images are not five megabytes but maybe just 500K. All these kinds of things. So, become aware of the kinds of things that you are doing in your application design, or your website design, that actually may just use less resources,&#8221; he said. In a way, that&#8217;s against how engineers are trained to think, but Vogels argues that&#8217;s it&#8217;s a question of what you optimize for. Maybe a bit of extra latency reduces conversion rates, but it does help you meet your sustainability goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two <span class=" ">or</span> <span class=" ">three</span> <span class=" ">years</span> <span class=" ">down</span> <span class=" ">the</span> <span class=" ">road,</span> <span class=" ">we&#8217;ll</span> <span class=" ">see</span> <span class=" ">many</span> <span class=" ">more</span> <span class=" ">development</span> <span class=" ">practices</span> <span class=" ">happening</span> <span class=" ">around</span> <span class=" ">that a</span><span class=" ">nd,</span> <span class=" ">of</span> <span class=" ">course,</span> <span class=" ">tools</span> <span class=" ">to</span> <span class=" ">measure,</span> <span class=" ">because</span> <span class=" ">you</span> <span class=" ">need</span> <span class=" ">to</span> <span class=" ">know</span> <span class=" ">what</span> <span class=" ">you</span> are <span class=" ">doing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But he also noted that it&#8217;ll be up to the customers to decide what they want to optimize for: &#8220;<span class="">I&#8217;m</span> <span class="">not</span> <span class="">going</span> <span class="">to</span> <span class="">tell</span> <span class="">my</span> <span class="">customers</span> <span class="">what</span> <span class="">they</span> <span class="">should</span> <span class="">be</span> <span class="">doing, </span><span class="">because</span> <span class="">I</span> <span class="">believe</span> <span class="">that </span><span class="">there</span> <span class="">should</span> <span class="">be</span> <span class="">no</span> <span class="">gatekeepers.</span> P<span class="">eople</span> <span class="">should</span> <span class="">be</span> able <span class="">to</span> <span class="">innovate</span> <span class="">in</span> <span class="">any</span> <span class="">way</span> <span class="">that</span> <span class="">they</span> <span class="">would</span> <span class="">want</span> <span class="">to,</span> <span class="">but</span> <span class="">they</span> <span class="">need</span> <span class="">to</span> <span class="">become</span> <span class="">conscious</span> <span class="">to</span> <span class="">themselves.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Looking ahead, one of those technologies that keeps Vogels energized is quantum computing. Earlier this year, AWS announced that it would start building its own quantum hardware, with a bet <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/quantum-computing/announcing-the-opening-of-the-aws-center-for-quantum-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on superconducting qubits</a>. As of now, the company is partnering with a number of major quantum players, including IonQ, Rigetti and D-Wave, in making their hardware and services available through its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braket</a> service. But clearly, just like Google and Microsoft, AWS believes in building its own quantum hardware, too, just like it does for classical chips.</p>

<p>And so chances are, barring another global lockdown, we&#8217;ll see Vogels take the stage on the last day of re:Invent 2024 and talk about AWS&#8217; latest improvements to its quantum computer and how the developers in the audience can make the best possible use of that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://torq.io/">Torq</a>, a Portland, Oregon-based no-code security automation startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/stackpulse-announces-28m-investment-to-help-developers-manage-outages/">formerly known as StackPulse</a>, today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series B round led by Insight Partners. New investor <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/">SentinelOne</a>, the publicly traded endpoint security platform, also participated in this round, as well as existing investors GGV Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners. This brings Torq&#8217;s total funding to date to $78 million.</p>
<p>No-code/low-code platforms are obviously all the rage these days, though we tend to see fewer of them in the security space. Torq, which counts the likes of NS1, eToro, Armis and Healthy.io among its users, uses an easy-to-use graphical interface to help security teams automate routing workflows across security products. In that respect, it&#8217;s not that different from a Microsoft Power Automate, but with a singular focus on security.</p>
<p>The promise of Torq is that it can bring together the complex jumble of security tools that modern enterprises now deploy to keep their data safe. The service&#8217;s workflows can be triggered at regular intervals or from alerts. These can be simple workflows like reacting to Slack requests from employees for privileged access to a cloud resource, for example, or automating the analysis process of a suspicious file.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244111" style="width: 1380px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244111" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244111 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png" alt="Torq workflow" width="1370" height="1199" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png 1370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png?resize=768,672 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png?resize=680,595 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/torq-workflow-full.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244111" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Torq</p></div></p>
<p>“Torq’s automation has transformed how our team manages security,&#8221; said Lemonade CISO Jonathan Jaffe. &#8220;As just one example, using Torq to manage web application firewall blocking rules reduced time to block malicious traffic by 70x, and increased coverage to over 90% &#8211; a significant improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Torq CEO and co-founder Ofer Smadari noted, the company spent the time between its last funding round and today by focusing on the overall user experience. &#8220;We’ve made significant investments in the user experience &#8212; making it easier for users to connect other systems, create more complex workflows, and enhancing speed and responsiveness of the interface,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We invested heavily in scalability and resilience from the onset to ensure that Torq supports enterprises at any scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to support its growing number of customers and prospects as they scale their usage of the service. According to Smadari, the average number of workflows a customer runs on the service is currently growing 2-3x every week. &#8220;Once a customer gets started, they’re quick to expand. Making sure we are built to support this growth &#8211; before it happens &#8211; is essential,&#8221; said Smadari.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while Torq itself was built to help with some of the talent shortage in the security industry by freeing up security teams from routine tasks, Smadari also noted that its company&#8217;s biggest challenge right now is hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Torq’s rapid success is a testament to how the platform makes it easier for security teams to deliver better protection across every aspect of the business,&#8221; said Steve Ward, Managing Director at Insight Partners. &#8220;With its intuitive product and experienced team, Torq is quickly becoming a leader in the industry. We’re thrilled to partner with the Torq team as they continue to grow.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis laid out Tuesday an ambitious plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software in its vehicles that can sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions. The target is in line with goals from its competitors — all of which are seeking ways to make revenue beyond selling, repairing and financing vehicles.</p>
<p>Stellantis, the global automaker that merged Fiat Chrsyler and French PSA Group, said it will invest more than $33.7 billion through 2025 into software and electrification. That investment will include employing 4,500 software engineers by 2024.</p>
<p>The end goal is to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030 that Stellantis can generate revenue from for years after they&#8217;re sold to consumers. To reach its target, Stellantis will lean on partnerships with BMW, Foxconn and Waymo. Today, the company has 12 million &#8220;monetizable&#8221; connected cars globally. Stellantis defines &#8220;monetizable&#8221; as the vehicle&#8217;s first five years of life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>How does the company plan to actually make money? It starts with the underlying electrical and software architecture, which it&#8217;s calling STLA Brain. This underlying system is integrated with the cloud that connects electronic control units within the vehicle with the vehicle&#8217;s central high performing computer via a high-speed data bus. It will allow the company to upgrade software to vehicles &#8220;over the air,&#8221; or wirelessly.</p>
<p>On top of this &#8220;brain,&#8221; Stellantis will add its &#8220;SmartCockpit,&#8221; a platform built in partnership with Foxconn that will deliver applications to the driver such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce marketplace and payment services. Separately, Stellantis announced it signed a<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> non-binding memorandum of understanding with Foxconn to design a family of purpose-built microcontrollers. The partnership is intended to develop four families of chips that will cover more than 80% of the automaker&#8217;s microcontrollers&#8217; needs.</span></p>
<p>Finally, a third automated driving platform called &#8220;AutoDrive,&#8221; developed with BMW, will complete the automaker&#8217;s software plan. All three of these platforms — &#8220;brain,&#8221; &#8220;smartcockpit&#8221; and &#8220;autodrive&#8221; will be in all new Stellantis vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>Tesla was the first company to make software the central tenet of its vehicle, using over-the-air updates to add video games, improve performance or allow owners to upgrade the advanced driver assistance system. But automakers have long seen potential in using the vast amount of data collected daily to offer in-car services to owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, an increasing number of automakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-aims-to-build-netflix-sized-subscription-business-by-2030/">such as GM</a> have the technical capability to actually offer drivers the ability to subscribe to services they may want in a vehicle. That move hasn&#8217;t been without controversy, as consumers push back on the idea of having to subscribe to options like heated seats or adaptive cruise control that one used to pay for at the time the vehicle was purchased.</p>
<p>Stellantis plans to use software to offer car owners services and subscriptions and features on demand. It will also offer commercial customers data-as-a-service and fleet services. For instance, Stellantis said that in 2022 it plans to use its data collection capabilities to launch a usage-based insurance program offered through its finance arms in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Stellantis said its software strategy works with its plan to electrify its vehicle portfolio. Stellantis announced in July 2021 a goal for more than 70% of its vehicle sales in Europe and more than 40% of vehicle sales in the United States to be low-emission vehicles by 2030.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sendowl.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhreNBhAYEiwAFGGKPCx7ZEbN-_nGl1dr7SWRiUCVe2M6DCkajUBmaeiDJ6lJsn_WnjyDxRoCKNMQAvD_BwE">SendOwl</a>, a platform used to sell and deliver digital products, has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from Defy.vc, with participation from Stripe and other investors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">SendOwl enables creators and businesses to sell digital goods such as ebooks, podcasts, online courses, memberships, coaching services, live remote events and more. Users are able to do so on their existing website or blog via SendOwl&#8217;s payment links, integrations with Stripe and Shopify, or by using SendOwl&#8217;s API. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to increase the GDP of the creator economy and is a remote-first company with employees across three continents and customers in more than 50 countries. SendOwl says it has delivered nearly $2 billion of value in digital and virtual goods for tens of thousands of paying merchants across millions of transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current SendOwl customers range from Universal Music Group and fitness influencer Kayla Itsines to thousands of independent creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SendOwl CEO Matt Plotke, who was previously a growth leader at Stripe and Linkedin, says SendOwl plans to use its seed funding to further accelerate growth and to offer new products and infrastructure to meet the growing needs of the creator economy. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our focus is on team, product, and growth. We’re actively hiring across engineering, product, marketing, and more which will enable us to ship SendOwl 2.0 while also continuing to scale our existing product and user base,&#8221; Plotke told TechCrunch. &#8220;We saw some really amazing organic growth during the heights of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to continue to build on that momentum while delighting our existing user base with more products and features coming soon.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243539" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243539" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243539" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png 1606w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=1536,851 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sendowl-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243539" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SendOwl</p></div></p>
<p>SendOwl was founded a decade as a side project by George Palmer, who says he was unable to find a reliable way to sell digital goods directly to buyers. Plotke explained that when he had the opportunity to buy the company in 2020, he moved as quickly as possible to make it happen. Now, Plotke says SendOwl is back to a &#8220;re-founding&#8221; moment as it has raised money from defy.vc and Stripe and is also in the process of enhancing its platform.</p>
<p>Plotke says SendOwl differs from its competition because it <span style="font-weight: 400;">lets sellers sell what they want and where they want across multiple platforms. He notes that users can quickly create an account, add payment capabilities, create a product, make it available for sale and get it in the hands of potential buyers through a simple process. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the most popular activity on the platform, SendOwl sees lots of merchants selling audio files such as music, podcasts and guides. The platform also sees merchants selling videos, coaching services, memberships, secure PDFs and access to live events. SendOwl sees the most activity in <span style="font-weight: 400;">music, books and writing, health and beauty, apps and software, sports, hobbyist content, food and cooking, professional development and influencer marketing.</span></p>
<p>In terms of the future, Plotke says &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the next generation of SendOwl, if we execute right, is going to change the game for creators, businesses and end buyers. It’s still day zero for digital goods in our minds. We want to get to parity and go beyond the tools and infrastructure that has been built for physical goods internet commerce.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes I wonder if the analysts on Wall Street, who I&#8217;m sure are smart people, understand how the technology industry works.</p>
<p>There is this persistent notion among investors that stocks that did well during the pandemic like Zoom, DocuSign and Okta will suddenly fade from our minds as soon as the pandemic subsides (if that ever happens). The same analysts who fawn over a stock one month dump it the next when the growth projection is suddenly smaller (and much more realistic), knowing full well no company can maintain the pandemic numbers we were seeing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not here to give financial advice, but I can tell you that digital tooling is not going away. The cloud is not a passing fad. It is not some pandemic-driven flash in the pan. It is in fact, the future of work, the future of computing, and anything that&#8217;s not digitized now will be sooner than later. The question is why investors can&#8217;t understand this and connect it to the short- and long-term performance of a given SaaS stock.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The cloud ecosystem consists of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/wtf-is-cloud-computing/">three main elements</a> &#8212; infrastructure, platform and software &#8212; all delivered as a service, as they say. According to <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/2021-first-half-review-cloud-ecosystem-revenues-leap-25-to-235-billion">data from Synergy Research</a>, the entire cloud ecosystem grew 25% in the first half this year to $235 billion.</p>
<p>Most people buy their software from companies like Salesforce, Okta, Box, Dropbox, DocuSign, Workday, ServiceNow and so many more, which manage it for them and provide updates on a regular basis automatically. Just about all software is delivered as a service these days&#8211;  unless there&#8217;s a technical reason that makes more sense to manage it yourself.</p>
<p>For those folks, there is also software you can install in your cloud of choice or software you can build using one of the platform services and then install using the infrastructure services. What you choose and how you choose to do it could depend on a lot of factors, but the trend is toward the cloud on all fronts.</p>
<p>As Amazon-AWS boss Adam Selipsky pointed out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/what-does-this-have-to-do-with-selling-books/">during his keynote last week</a> at AWS re:Invent, there is still only somewhere between 5% and 15% of workloads in the cloud. That leaves years of growth for an industry that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">on a $180 billion run rate</a> last quarter and shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.</p>
<p>But Wall Street seems<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/lets-talk-about-the-saas-selloff/"> most concerned with the SaaS companies</a>, the software firms built atop AWS and other public clouds. When Zoom was flying high during the pandemic because everyone from students and churches to your family and your job moved online, investors took notice in a big way.</p>
<p>They inflated the value of Zoom stock<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/zoom-looks-beyond-video-conferencing-as-triple-digit-2020-growth-begins-to-slow/"> to an almost absurd level</a>. To be fair, they were reacting to the monstrous pandemic-driven growth the company experienced. During the height of the lockdown, Zoom logged five straight quarters of triple-digit growth. You read that correctly: In the March 2021 earnings report, which corresponded to the company&#8217;s Q4 2021, Zoom’s growth peaked at 369%.</p>
<p>Investors saw five quarters of growth like that and lost their minds, thinking it would last forever. It didn&#8217;t. The stock peaked at $559 per share in October 2020 before hitting a steady decline. Today it sits at around $184 per share. That&#8217;s a precipitous drop.</p>

<p>Did Zoom stop being popular? Did the need for video conferencing suddenly evaporate? No, of course not. People are still making liberal use of Zoom. The company is even attempting to diversify from video conferencing into other areas.</p>
<p>Sure, their growth is much more modest, but also much more realistic. It&#8217;s where you would expect a company like that to be &#8212; around 35% for the most recent quarter on over $1 billion in revenue. I think most companies would take that. Zoom was never going to maintain those kinds of growth numbers. Nobody ever could, but Wall Street rode the wave, watched it crash back down, and then complained about it.</p>
<p>At this point, we know that video services are a big deal. We know that Zoom is the market leader. We know the company is on a $4 billion run rate. These are all solid metrics, but the stock continues to plummet. At some point, you have to accept the current reality and stop punishing the stock.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/tech-stocks-are-getting-hammered-again/">DocuSign lost an astonishing 40%</a> of its stock value. Did people suddenly swear they would stop signing digitally because it was too easy? Did DocuSign stop being the market leader? As my colleague Ryan Lawler put it on Twitter upon seeing the beating the stock was taking:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I guess we’re all just going back to signing documents in person</p>
<p>&mdash; Ryan Lawler (@ryanlawler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanlawler/status/1466819947242393604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And as I replied:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You nailed it Ryan. That&#39;s just it! We aren&#39;t. That&#39;s why this reaction is Wall Street short termism at its worst.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ron Miller (@ron_miller) <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/1466822567130451968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The reason for the plunge was not even a bad earnings report. In fact, the company reported $545.5 million, an <a href="https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/DocuSign-Announces-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2022-Financial-Results/">increase</a> of 42% year over year &#8212; results anyone could get behind, right? Well, like Zoom, Wall Street had over-inflated the value of the pandemic-driven growth and had serious buyer&#8217;s remorse when the company reported slowing growth. Not <em>negative</em> growth. Not huge losses. Simply slower growth. And investors got panicky and started dumping the stock.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not even discuss the herd mentality, the absurdity of everyone trying to jettison the stock at once. Nobody paused to take a deep breath and see if the fundamentals of this company were somehow less solid than the day before they reported earnings. Were there any red flags beyond the slowing growth, this absurd idea that if you are not continually growing at an accelerated rate, you are somehow less valuable? If you are growing at a reasonable rate, and you are not losing money, and it looks like that will continue into the future, that sounds like a good company to me.</p>
<p>But we saw it again and again last week, when Salesforce and Okta stock also dropped. Surprisingly, Box, a company that Wall Street loves to beat up, did pretty well after its report of the third straight quarter of growing revenue. This wasn&#8217;t even as good as Zoom&#8217;s 35% or DocuSign&#8217;s 42%. It was a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211130005922/en/Box-Reports-Strong-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results">solid 14%</a>, and it showed continued progression upward instead of a movement down, and that seems to make investors more comfortable, even if the growth was more modest.</p>
<p>Wall Street is going to do what it does, and it usually makes money in the long run. But you have to wonder why decent growth, but not <em>explosive</em> growth, somehow sends investors into a tizzy. That&#8217;s what we saw last week, and we will probably see it again. Because for investors, even good sometimes isn&#8217;t good enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ireland&#8217;s embattled data protection regulator, the DPC, <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/irish-dpc-submits-article-60-draft-decision-inquiry-instagram">has announced</a> the submission of a draft decision sent to other EU DPAs Friday in relation to a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) investigation into Instagram&#8217;s handling of children&#8217;s data that was opened over a year ago.</p>
<p>The DPC announced two statutory inquiries into Instagram, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/instagrams-handling-of-kids-data-is-now-being-probed-in-the-eu/">October 2020</a>, looking at how the social networking giant processes children&#8217;s information following a number of complaints &#8212; including one inquiry it said would examine the legal basis Facebook claims for processing children’s data on Instagram, and whether or not there are &#8220;adequate safeguards&#8221; in place.</p>
<p>The second inquiry was slated to examine Instagram&#8217;s profile and account settings &#8212; looking at the &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; of settings for children &#8212; for whom the GDPR sets a very high standard of data protection on key principles like &#8216;Data Protection by Design and Default&#8217;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243993" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a statement today, DPC deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, confirmed the regulator has handed the baton to other EU data protection authorities (DPAs) to weigh in, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the Lead Supervisory Authority for Facebook/Instagram, we opened this inquiry in September 2020. It was commenced in response to information provided to the DPC by a third party, and also in connection with issues identified by the DPC following examination of the Instagram user registration process. We last week submitted our draft decision to our colleagues for their views on it. This is part of the process under Article 60 of the GDPR, where we send draft decisions to other Concerned Supervisory Authorities and they have one month to send us their &#8216;reasoned and relevant objections&#8217;. This is the seventh DPC inquiry to have reached the Article 60 stage under the GDPR. In addition to this Instagram inquiry, two other DPC inquiries into Facebook are currently at the Article 60 stage.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The submission of a draft decision by a lead supervisory authority is a standard part of the regulatory process for cross-border GDPR cases. It allows other DPAs to review the lead DPA&#8217;s conclusions and submit objections if they disagree &#8212; as has happened with all other such DPC draft GDPR decisions pertaining to big tech.</p>
<p>The only two final decisions to come out of Ireland on such cases so far &#8212; on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">WhatsApp</a> &#8212; passed through this Article 60 review process and both received objections that led to increased penalties (substantially increased in WhatsApp&#8217;s case) vs the lower ball suggestion of the DPC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is likely that Ireland&#8217;s draft decision on Instagram will face similar pushback from other data supervisors across the bloc. Although the DPC is keeping its conclusions under wraps.</p>
<p>In terms of timeframe, it could take over half a year before a final decision on the Instagram complaint is settled &#8212; judging by how long the process has taken to rework earlier DPC draft decisions.</p>
<p>In the Twitter case, the DPC submitted a draft decision in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/first-major-gdpr-decisions-looming-on-twitter-and-facebook/">May 2020</a>, and a final decision was issued in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">December</a> of the same year. While the WhatsApp draft was submitted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/whatsapp-facebook-data-sharing-transparency-under-review-by-eu-dpas-after-ireland-sends-draft-decision/">January 2021</a> &#8212; but took until September for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">the $267M fine for WhatsApp to be agreed</a>.</p>
<p>So a final decision on Instagram may not arrive before mid 2022.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the social network is facing high level pressure on home soil over its impact on vulnerable users like teens, following revelations by the Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who leaked thousands of internal documents to the media this fall &#8212; including research that appears to show <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">the platform has a toxic impact on teenage girls&#8217; body image</a>.</p>
<p>And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">September</a>, amid a wave of negative press and critical backlash, Instagram announced it was &#8220;pausing&#8221; development on a version of its service planned for under 13s.</p>
<p>This week, Instagram chief, Adam Mosseri has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">called to give evidence to the US Senate</a> &#8212; as part of a series of hearings about online safety for children and teens. And ahead of that hearing the platform just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">announced a slate of new safety features</a> for &#8220;young people&#8221; &#8212; including its first parental tools (due early next year).</p>
<p>So whatever GDPR decision eventually emerges from the Ireland-led Instagram probes, Meta will be able to claim the platform has moved on in how it handles children&#8217;s data &#8212; and that any enforcement the EU orders is already out of date.</p>

<h2>Criticism of DPC&#8217;s close working with Meta</h2>
<p>The timing of the DPC&#8217;s public notification of the Instagram draft submission comes as the regulator is facing a firestorm of fresh criticism over its close working with Facebook/Meta: Aka, the tech giant that owns Instagram and over whose data-mining empire the DPC holds (on paper) a lead supervisory role, thanks to the GDPR&#8217;s (forum shopping-friendly) one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/second-noyb-advent-reading-facebookdpc-documents">document</a> released Sunday by European privacy campaign group, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> details an intervention by the DPC that&#8217;s clearly aligned with the interests of Facebook, as the regulator can be seen pushing for what noyb bills as a &#8220;consent bypass&#8221; to be written into EDPB&#8217;s GDPR guidelines.</p>
<p>Clearly aligned because Facebook has indeed sought to game GDPR compliance by switching from a consent-based legal basis for processing users&#8217; data for ad targeting (which is legally problematic since Facebook does not offer users a free choice over whether they accept behavioral ads or not; indeed, there is no choice unless you stop using Facebook entirely; yet for consent to be legal under GDPR it must be specific, informed and freely given&#8230; ) &#8212; to, as the regulation came into application in 2018, the aforementioned consent bypass whereby it shifted to a claim that users of its services are actually in a contractual agreement with it to receive targeted ads&#8230; Which would be quite the personal data heist to pull off &#8212; were that switcheroo to be accepted by European data protection regulators.</p>
<p>noyb has been challenging Facebook over this &#8220;forced consent&#8221; since May 2018 &#8212; when it filed its first GDPR complaints.</p>
<p>The DPC has yet to decide on the complaint but the regular is minded to accept Facebook&#8217;s GDPR consent bypass &#8212; per a draft decision which was published by noyb this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">October</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6XJZXdva9S"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">Ireland&#8217;s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/embed/#?secret=6XJZXdva9S" data-secret="6XJZXdva9S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The not-for-profit followed up that revelation by filing a charge of criminal corruption against the DPC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">last month</a> &#8212; accusing the regulator of &#8220;procedural blackmail&#8221; and revealing it had written to noyb demanding it take down the draft decision. The DPC also pressured noyb to sign a non-disclosure order in relation to the ongoing procedure against Facebook &#8212; and the regulator&#8217;s correspondence implied it would exclude noyb as a party to the ongoing GDPR process if it did not agree to the blanket confidentiality demand.</p>
<p>noyb argues there is no legal basis for the DPC to gag the oversight process in this way. (Indeed, it&#8217;s literally asked the regulator to file a suit against it so that it can challenge any such claim in court.)</p>
<p>It has doubled down on criticism of the DPC&#8217;s attempts to enforce confidentiality by releasing further documents each Sunday before Christmas &#8212; to shine more light on the inner function (and, critics would say, dysfunction) of the DPC.</p>
<p>The regulator has hit back with lengthy rebuttals that, nonetheless, don&#8217;t address the core legal points being raised by noyb (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">see, for e.g., the updates to this report</a>).</p>
<p>Today the DPC has issued a new <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/statement-dpc-regarding-allegations-made-media-publications-05-and-06-and-07-december">public statement</a> &#8212; in which it denies acting in &#8220;bad faith on foot of meetings it held with Facebook as part of its regulatory role&#8221;; denies it &#8220;lobbied&#8221; the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to try to get it to adopt guidelines that would have been &#8220;in the best interests&#8221; of Facebook; and further claims: &#8220;[noyb&#8217;s] allegations are utterly untrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its statement does, however, admit to providing Facebook &#8212; between late 2017 and March 2018 &#8212; with what the regulator characterizes as &#8220;high level feedback&#8221; vis-a-vis Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;GDPR preparation programme&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked the DPC for more details about the feedback it provided to Meta/Facebook during this period.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s statement goes on to deny that it helped Facebook develop the GDPR consent bypass, with the regulator writing: &#8220;[A]t no time in the course of its engagement with Facebook&#8230; did the DPC approve, jointly develop, endorse, consent to, or negotiate on the processing operations of Facebook. Neither it must be emphasised did the DPC at any time suggest or intimate to Facebook that Article 6(1)(b) [&#8220;processing is necessary for the performance of a contract&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">] was an appropriate lawful basis on which to base its processing operations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>However the DPC&#8217;s statement appears to confirm it <em>did</em> discuss the potential of Facebook relying on Article 6(1)(b) &#8212; aka moving consent into the T&amp;Cs as a contract clause &#8212; as a strategy for GDPR compliance, as the regulator specifies that &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">there were discussions on this matter&#8230; only insofar as to probe Facebook on its considerations concerning Article 6(1)(b) and to seek substantiation of its legal reasoning&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this report if the DPC sends additional clarification on these discussions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the past decade, numerous mobile lending apps have been launched in Kenya, riding on the growing need for quick loans.</p>
<p>However, these startups have been operating in an unregulated environment &#8212; until today, when the country’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, approved a new law that gives the country’s monetary authority, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the power to regulate the industry and take action on those that violate consumer privacy.</p>
<p>“The amended Central Bank Act, 2021, gives the Central Bank of Kenya authority to license digital lenders in the country as well as ensure the existence of fair and non-discriminatory practices in the credit market,” <a href="https://www.president.go.ke/2021/12/07/president-kenyatta-signs-five-parliamentary-bills-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the president’s office.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244032" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the new legislation, lenders are required to apply for licenses from the CBK, as compared to previously, when they only had to register to set up operations in the East African country.</p>
<p>The lack of regulation meant that customer privacy was never guaranteed as these digital lenders arbitrarily shared user data with third parties. Besides, customers defaulting on loan repayments faced unending reminder calls from debt collectors, who also used shaming tactics like calling friends and family to compel defaulters to pay.</p>
<p>Almost all lending apps were found to use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">debt-shaming tactics</a> to recover debt in Kenya. They have also faced claims of using predatory lending tactics.</p>
<p>The digital lenders now have six months to apply for the licenses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Any person who before the coming into force of this Act was in the digital credit business and is not regulated under any other law, shall apply for a license… within six months of publication of the regulations,” according to a clause in the newly passed law.</p>
<p>Digital lenders are preferred by borrowers in emerging markets, who are often unbanked and have no access to financing from conventional banking institutions.</p>
<p>Besides, loan apps offer collateral-free loans but they are also high-priced, with some annualized interest rates going up to 876%, according to this <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/">report</a> that published findings of the exorbitant and predatory pricing strategies of the Chinese-owned Okash and Opesa loan apps.</p>
<p>Other loan apps with a presence in Kenya include San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd., and PayPal-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tala-grabs-145m-to-offer-more-financial-services-in-emerging-markets/">Tala</a>.</p>
<p>The loan apps will be expected to observe customer confidentiality by adhering to “the conditions of the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act”, or risk license withdrawal.</p>
<p>Kenya’s Data Protection Act ensures that borrowers’ confidential information is safe from infringement by unauthorized parties and requires firms to disclose to customers the reasons for collecting their data. The lending apps have earlier been accused of sharing customer data with allies and marketing companies.</p>
<p>Usually, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">loan apps collect borrowers’ phone data</a>, including contacts, and demand access to messages to check the history of mobile money transactions — for credit scoring, and as conditions for disbursing loans.</p>
<p>Rogue lenders, however, use some of the contact information collected to recover the loans disbursed in cases where borrowers default, or for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Going forward, the mobile loan apps will be required to reveal all the information concerning their products including details on pricing, penalties for defaulters and the modalities of debt recovery.</p>
<p>This is per Kenya’s Consumer Protection Act, which requires sellers to disclose to consumers all the terms and conditions pertaining to the purchase of goods or services.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon today announced the official launch of the Alexa Together subscription service, aimed at families caring for elderly members who are still living independently but need extra support.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced the official launch of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alexa-Together/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21390531011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexa Together</a> subscription service, aimed at families caring for elderly members who are still living independently but need extra support. The feature,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-launches-an-elder-care-subscription-service-alexa-together/"> first introduced</a> at the company&#8217;s fall 2021 event, expands on Amazon&#8217;s existing product Alexa Care Hub and packages it as a $19.99 per month or $199 per year subscription service.</p>
<p>Alexa Care Hub was the company&#8217;s first attempt at turning Alexa devices in the home into a tool for caring for aging family members. That service included a set of features that would allow family members to keep an eye on older parents and other loved ones &#8212; with their permission &#8212; and could be altered to certain activities, like if the family member had called out for help, for example.</p>
<p>Alexa Together expands on the Care Hub feature set to combine access to an emergency helpline, fall detection response features, a remote assist option that allows family members to manage settings on the elderly person&#8217;s device and an activity feed for family members that notifies them when their loved one is active &#8212; engaging with Alexa or other smart home devices, or notified when there&#8217;s been a lag in that usual activity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The features are designed to be used in an opt-in consented environment, where both parties must complete the sign-up process together to enable these features.</p>
<p>Once configured, the system allows the elderly person to say &#8220;Alexa, call for help,&#8221; if they&#8217;re ever in need of emergency assistance. A trained agent on the other end will then be able to dispatch the police, the fire department or an ambulance to their location, much like what&#8217;s possible with some home security systems. However, the Alexa Together system can also work with third-party devices from Assistive Technology Service (ATS) and Vayyar to detect if the customer may be in need of emergency assistance from a fall and proactively help.</p>
<p>Vayyar Care is a wall-mounted sensor that is able to identify when a fall has happened, while SkyAngelCare by ATS is a fall-detection pendant that aging customers wear around their neck. Both can detect a fall &#8212; the latter if the customer presses a help button on their pendant. Amazon says more device makers will be added to Alexa Together in time.</p>
<p>The Remote Assist set of features allows a family member to manage various settings on the elderly member&#8217;s device. This includes setting reminders, adding contacts for calls and messages, adding and checking things off a shopping list, or linking a music service. This enables the family member to provide IT assistance, instead of requiring the elderly member having to call Amazon for help.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244091" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244091" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2244091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?w=647" alt="" width="460" height="483" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png 1202w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?resize=285,300 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?resize=768,808 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?resize=647,680 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alexa-Together_LP_Desktop_Custom-Alerts_003.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244091" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The activity feed will send alerts to family members to let them know their aging loved one has started their day and had their first interaction with Alexa or other connected smart home devices. This is an imperfect system in terms of serving as a proxy for knowing if the family member is doing okay, as it assumes they&#8217;ll engage with Alexa regularly. But the feed will send alerts if there&#8217;s been no activity, which could remind a family member to reach out to their loved one and make sure everything is okay.</p>
<p>The subscription service is offering an expansive six-month free trial to allow customers to determine if the solution is a good fit for them. And existing Alexa Care Hub customers will also now receive a free year of Alexa Together starting today until December 7, 2022.</p>
<p>In the future, Amazon says it will roll out the ability for Alexa Together to support multiple caregivers, including family, friends and even neighbors, among other features.</p>
<p>Amazon has been increasing its investment in using Alexa to care for the elderly and infirm. In addition to Care Hub and Alexa Together, the company this fall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/amazon-brings-alexa-to-hospitals-and-senior-living-centers/">also announced</a> it was bringing Alexa to hospitals and senior living centers, like Atria and Eskaton living centers and hospitals including Cedars-Sinai, BayCare and Houston Methodist. The company also said it would work with partners who can tap into Alexa Smart Properties tools and APIs that allow them to develop specialized solutions for the elderly care market, including K4Connect, Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva and Vocera. To make these solutions possible, Amazon has been working to make Alexa&#8217;s medical skills <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">HIPAA-compliant</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/amazon-is-building-a-health-and-wellness-team-within-alexa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built</a> out a healthcare team to navigate other HIPAA regulations.</p>
<p>But while many of those existing elderly care solutions are designed to be sold in a business-to-business (B2B) environment, the Alexa Care Hub and now Alexa Together services target the consumer market with a subscription offering.</p>
<p>Alexa Together works with supported Alexa devices, like the Echo, Echo Dot or Echo Show, and is available either as an add-on service or in a device <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FYLF9YT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bundle</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discord is introducing a new way for creators to make money by offering community members access to paid, subscriber-only content. The new premium membership offering was among the company&#8217;s most requested features and would bring a new stream of revenue in-house while giving Discord-based communities the option to streamline the tools they use to grow.</p>
<p>Through premium memberships, Discord communities will be able to place part or all of their content behind a pay gate. Servers could remain mostly free and open with one premium paid channel for the most dedicated members or an entire community could go premium, requiring payment for access.</p>
<p>The company is calling premium memberships a &#8220;very early pilot&#8221; for now and the feature will roll out first to a small group of communities that will test the paid features and offer feedback. Communities in the small test group for premium memberships include a gaming boot camp that provides tutorials and advice, the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/transcc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trans Community Center</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eposvox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream Professor</a>, a server of tutorials on streaming tech.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244040" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important we make running Discord communities more sustainable,&#8221; Derek Yang, Discord&#8217;s lead product manager for creator products, told TechCrunch. Yang said that the company hasn&#8217;t set a date for a broad rollout for premium subscriptions and is taking the product one step at a time to get it right.</p>
<p>Many Discord communities were already using third-party services <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/213552323-How-to-connect-Discord-to-Patreon-Creator-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like Patreon</a> to manage access to premium content. With the option brought into Discord itself, communities will be able to create customized tiers of perks that members can subscribe to alongside existing payments they&#8217;d make for Discord&#8217;s own premium Nitro features.</p>
<p>The company plans to take a 10% cut of paid membership subscriptions, though that number could shift in the future depending on how its experiments in creator monetization go. In May, the company began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/discord-stage-discovery/">testing ticketed virtual events</a>, its first feature that allowed creators to make money on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve been chatting with more and more creators we wanted to ensure that they can not only build, but maintain and sustain these amazing communities,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/building-sustainable-creator-communities-on-discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. &#8220;And we’re already seeing that members of these communities are willing to pay creators for the value that is created.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1467986249852063748" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> to all users on iOS, Android and the web the option to listen to a recording of a Space. This latest move brings the social media giant&#8217;s Spaces feature more in line with traditional podcasts, as users can now listen to a conversation after the live broadcast has ended. The new feature comes as Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">introduced</a> a Replay option to let users record live rooms and share them later.</p>
<p>Twitter is also giving some hosts the ability to record Spaces on iOS and Android. The feature was initially only available to select hosts on iOS following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-launches-spaces-recording-feature-to-testers-on-ios-global-launch-to-follow/">the launch</a> of recorded Spaces in October.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1467986249852063748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>To use the feature, a Spaces host will create their live audio room by giving their Space a title and selecting up to three tags to describe what the room’s about, as usual. They can then toggle on the new setting, “Record Space,” before tapping on the “Start a Space” button to begin their live audio session.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If users are in a Twitter Space that’s being recorded, they&#8217;ll see a “Rec” button with a red dot next to it at the top of the Space as an indication that the recording is underway.</p>
<p>When the host is ready to end the Space, they’ll tap on the “End” button at the top-right as usual, and will then be presented with a pop-up box that asks them to confirm they want to end both the Space and stop the recording. Once wrapped, the recording of the Space can be shared across Twitter’s platform, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves.</p>
<p>Twitter has been working to expand and enhance its Spaces feature over the past few months. The social media giant recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/">rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune in to a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. Twitter stated that the new functionality is aimed at Spaces users who have friends that aren’t on Twitter but would still want to listen in on a Space.</p>
<p>These latest expansions open up Spaces to even more people and give Twitter a better chance of reaching new users.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[No matter where it prices or how we count shares, Samsara is set to crush its final private price. But is it expensive at those valuation marks?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsara is a company that has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samsara-2/company_financials">raised lots of private capital</a> at rather high prices. Back in 2018, for example, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/samsara-banks-100m-at-a-3-6b-valuation-for-its-internet-connected-sensors/">noted that the IoT platform company had raised $100 million</a> at a $3.6 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">Samsara is going public</a>, we were curious whether it would manage to best its prior private valuations. The answer appears to be an easy yes.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001642896/000119312521348620/d261594ds1a.htm">new SEC filing</a> that dropped this week, <a href="https://www.samsara.com/">Samsara</a> expects to price its IPO between $20 and $23 per share, likely valuing the San Francisco-based company at a multiple of its final private price set in 2020.</p>

Then we&#8217;ll do some work to better understand Samsara&#8217;s revenue multiples and what its value can tell us about its market. If you want a deeper dive into the mechanics of Samsara&#8217;s business, we have you covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">here</a>. Today we&#8217;re more interested in the resulting numbers, not how they were achieved.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Samsara worth at $23 per share?</h2>
<p>A lot, it turns out. Per the company&#8217;s latest S-1/A filing, Samsara expects to have 505,604,713 shares outstanding after selling 35,000,000 shares in its IPO and reserving 5,250,000 shares for its underwriters to purchase if they so choose.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s simple IPO valuation range, then, stretches from $10.1 billion to $11.6 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.majority.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MAJORITY</a>, a mobile banking service for migrants to the United States, said on Tuesday it had raised $27 million in its Series A funding round led by <a href="https://valar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valar Ventures</a>. Other existing investors, including <a href="https://www.avidventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avid Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.heartcore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heartcore Capital</a> and a group of Nordic fintech founders, also participated in the raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes just six months after MAJORITY </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $19 million in seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which TechCrunch previously reported, bringing MAJORITY’s total funding to $46 million to date. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the seed round, the company has been building out its advisor program, particularly in Florida, and developing its “know your customer” (KYC) process and remittance offering so it can onboard “larger Hispanic communities within the U.S.,” founder and CEO Magnus Larsson told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p>MAJORITY also announced today that it is rolling out a feature allowing its users to sign up for a bank account without a Social Security number, allowing them to use government ID from any other country along with proof of a U.S. address instead. The new feature will allow migrants to bypass onerous identity verification requirements that can bar them from accessing banking services for months at a time, the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is composed of about 45 tech and product employees based in Stockholm, Sweden, and 20-plus internal employees in the U.S., Larsson said. He added that the company employs “hundreds” of local advisers who onboard and support members of different migrant communities by working with them in their native languages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larsson himself is a Swedish migrant to the U.S. who served as CEO of one of Sweden’s largest telecom companies before launching a previous venture to provide low-cost cross-border calling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is currently awaiting visa approval so he can move from Stockholm to Miami to build out MAJORITY’s marketing and brand efforts. The company is also looking to scale its risk team and back-office functions, which it runs out of its Houston location.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243707" style="width: 1160px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243707" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243707 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg" alt="MAJORITY's meetup location in Miami, Florida." width="1150" height="774" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg 3854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MAJORITY-Location-15.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243707" class="wp-caption-text"><em>MAJORITY&#8217;s meetup location in Miami, Florida. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MAJORITY</em></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larsson founded MAJORITY in 2019 to serve the million-plus migrants who move to the U.S. every year. The app, which costs $5 per month, provides a range of features, including an FDIC-insured bank account with no overdraft fees, a debit card with community discounts, no-fee remittances and at-cost international calling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has saved its Cuban members an average of $21 per month and its Nigerian members an average of $10 per member each month beyond its membership fee because of its cost-efficient service offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the app’s core banking services are available in all 50 U.S. states, its advisers are only on the ground in Texas and Florida today. These states are hubs for some of the main communities the app already serves, Larsson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at different communities that we serve, they usually have a focal point. There is a town for Cubans &#8212; it&#8217;s Miami. For Ethiopians, it’s Washington, DC. For Somalians, it&#8217;s Minneapolis,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAJORITY provides customized services to about seven specific migrant communities by providing them with culturally specific features, such as discounts at local businesses. Larsson hopes to bring MAJORITY’s full product suite to another five or six communities in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships with local stores have proven to be an effective way for MAJORITY to grow its subscriber base, which it says has increased tenfold in the past year, though the company declined to share the number of users on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can come to meet an advisor outside of the grocery store, and five minutes later, you can walk away from there, with the bank [information] in your hand, and a Visa debit card in your hand, and you can usually add money and send it to another country directly in the store,” Larsson said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company was founded in January 2020 to make engaging with paying customers and thus building creator businesses as effortless as possible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a thriving community is the backbone for creators, but when the global pandemic hit, brands also found that they needed similar engagement with customers that were now interacting with their products online.</p>
<p><a href="http://circle.so/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circle</a> is working to make those engagements effortless by building a community platform so that creators and brands can bring their discussions, members and content together in one place, kind of like a “Shopify for creator and brand-led communities,” Sid Yadav, co-founder and CEO told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company was founded in January 2020 to make engaging with paying customers and thus building creator businesses as effortless as possible. We profiled the NYC-based startup last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/circle-community-tools-for-creators/">when it announced its $1.5 million seed round </a>in August 2020, and then again in February 2021 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/the-creator-movement-is-entering-primetime-and-so-is-circle-with-a-fresh-4m/">raised another $4 million</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2243644" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243644" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2243644" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?w=680" alt="Circle" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243644" class="wp-caption-text">Circle&#8217;s co-founders, from left, Sid Yadav, Rudy Santino and Andrew Guttormsen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Circle</p></div></p>
<p>Circle now has over 4,000 paying communities, paying subscriptions averaging $40 to $400 per month, that in total have 2 million members, Yadav said.</p>
<p>Investors continue to see the value and injected $24.7 million in Series A funding, Circle announced today. The round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from Box Group, Notation Capital and a group of individual investors including, Brendon Burchard, Adobe’s Scott Belsky, Codecademy CEO Zach Sims, Front CEO Mathilde Collin, Teachable CEO Ankur Nagpal and Menlo Security’s David Eckstein.</p>
<p>In addition to the investment, Burchard joins as an advisor to the company. Circle powers his GrowthDay community for over 300,000 members, Yadav said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment gives Circle $200 million in post-money valuation. This is a jump from a $40 million valuation from the February seed round. Over the last few months, Yadav said the company got signals that product market fit was there, which put levers in motion for Circle to move faster as the community space began getting competitive.</p>
<p>“For us, this is nice to have,” he added. “We want to make sure we earn the valuation and believe that we can return it for investors. One of the goals was to see how best to utilize the money to leapfrog the competition.”</p>
<p>Yadav wasn’t intending to raise additional capital so soon after its last round; in fact, the company thought it would be able to ride it out for a couple of years and go after capital again in early 2022.</p>
<p>However, after reaching 25% in month over month revenue growth in September and receiving inbound interest, especially from Tiger Global, the company thought it would be best to raise sooner and get the right valuation.</p>
<p>The attention from Tiger “was very flattering,” Yadav said. He was interested in their founder-first approach in investing and that the firm was going to connect Circle with its network of management consulting and recruiting.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The creator movement is entering prime time, and so is Circle with a fresh $4M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/the-creator-movement-is-entering-primetime-and-so-is-circle-with-a-fresh-4m/embed/#?secret=JDjOP5kmo3" data-secret="JDjOP5kmo3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Along with that recent growth, Circle just crossed over $4 million in annual recurring revenue, up from $1 million a year ago. It also now has 40 employees, growing from 15 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>It also launched several new features in 2021, including discussions, livestreaming, events capabilities and payments — features customers had been requesting.</p>
<p>“We were able to speak to a big chunk of early customers about what they were needing from the community platform,” Yadav said. “Some of our competitors were around for a long time, but what no one was getting right is an all-in-one approach combining chat, social media and community.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to further invest in R&amp;D, technology development, building both Android and desktop apps, investing in sales and customer success teams and creating a marketing team. Circle recently brought on a head of sales, so the company will be focused on ramping up that area as demand from brands and businesses comes in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salespeople are always looking for an edge when it comes to contacting potential customers. Knowing someone who knows someone at your target customer and can make an introduction means that it&#8217;s much more likely the contact will pay attention.</p>
<p>A former Salesforce executive wants to make it easier to find those connections, and he&#8217;s building <a href="https://www.ctd.ai/">Connect the Dots</a>, a startup that aims to build a personalized, professional relationship graph.</p>
<p>The way it works is you sign up and it scans any email accounts you have, looking for connections at different companies. It collects and correlates this data. When you look at a particular company, you can see who you know who knows someone there, with the strength of your connection measured by three colored dots. If they&#8217;re all green, it&#8217;s a solid connection and you can request an email introduction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Drew Sechrist, who was employee 36 at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">Salesforce in 1999</a>, was on Marc Benioff&#8217;s early sales team, pushing the company when nobody knew who they were or what hosted software was, for that matter. He recognized early on that having connections helped drive sales. He called Benioff the &#8220;number one alpha networker.&#8221; He could go to him at any time in those early days and get an intro, helping to grease the skids for his pitch, giving him a much better shot at a sale than going in cold.</p>
<p>He believes that email is the key connector. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got these emails that have been piling up forever representing relationships. And we just didn&#8217;t have any way to pull [them together] and get value out of them. But technology was getting to the point with machine learning and some other advanced techniques [that] we could extract value from that data and then build a graph of relationships to see who actually knows who,&#8221; Sechrist explained.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that LinkedIn was designed to do the same thing, but that it is too noisy and therefore unreliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asking for introductions on LinkedIn, salespeople and people who are recruiting or doing anything asking for a relationship introductions, they just get fatigued by asking people who don&#8217;t really know the person that they&#8217;re asking for the introduction,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sechrist wanted to build a better way to do that. Today, Connect the Dots has a social graph in beta by request, or, if you know someone using it, you can also get on, using the Clubhouse approach to user-base building.</p>
<p>The company used a $5 million seed round to build the product and recently closed a $15 million round led by Norwest Venture Partners, with participation from existing investors Cloud Apps Capital Partners and Velvet Sea Ventures. Connect the Dots has now raised a total of $20 million.</p>
<p>The company currently has 55 employees with a home base in San Francisco, though employees are spread out, with a big engineering team in Serbia. Sechrist is living in Miami at the moment. He plans to double the team in the next year with the new capital.</p>
<p>Coming from Salesforce, he recently had his team write their V2MOM, a document idea from his former company that, <a href="https://visible.vc/blog/v2mom-salesforce/">according to Salesforce,</a> is &#8220;a management process and acronym standing for vision, values, mission, objectives and measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually just finished our V2MOM. We flew people from Europe and the U.S. to Mexico last week. &#8230; We spent a week [defining] our core values, and one of those is being inclusive. So we want to build a company and a product that is inclusive for everybody,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He admits that it&#8217;s challenging to be racially diverse, especially with a large part of the workforce in Serbia, but it is something he&#8217;s working on as the company doubles its head count in the coming year. He plans to keep the company mostly remote, and that should help because he can recruit people from anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/crossbeam-lands-76m-series-c-as-network-effect-fuels-partner-cloud-growth/">Much like Crossbeam</a>, a networking company for partnerships, Sechrist hopes that as the networks grow into networks of networks, it will have a flywheel effect, making the product more valuable as more people use it. He hopes to have the product generally available sometime in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Under a new CEO, Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1468221427354517504?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made an acquisition</a> that speaks to what it might be looking at developing down the line to diversify away further from ad-based, open-ended consumer chatter. It has acquired <a href="http://quill.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quill</a>, a business-focused messaging service meant to compete against the likes of Slack and keep people, well, more focused.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Quill had raised <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/339831-55/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around $16 million</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/slack-investor-index-ventures-backs-slack-competitor-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backers</a> that included Sam Altman and Index Ventures and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/the-new-new-slack-quill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out of stealth</a> in February of this year. One of its biggest selling points &#8212; apart from being bold enough to speak out about the shortcomings of Slack and to try to build something to compete against its juggernaut-like momentum of growth that has been boosted by it getting acquired by Salesforce &#8212; was that it was founded by Ludwig Pettersson, the former creative director of Stripe, who is much admired by many in the startup community.</p>
<p>Quill is not making the cut in the acquisition: it will be winding down as an app, a spokesperson from Twitter said. Specifically, Quill notes in a <a href="https://quill.chat/updates/2021-12-07-quill-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief announcement</a> on its site that users will be &#8220;able to export your team message history until 1pm PST, Saturday, December 11th 2021, when we will be turning off our servers and deleting all data.&#8221; It will issue refunds for all active teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244005" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the team and its IP <em>are</em> joining the flock: Specifically, Quill&#8217;s people will be joining Twitter&#8217;s Experience organization to work on messaging tools, specifically Twitter direct messages. Pettersson will be taking a role as product manager, reporting into the Conversations team under <a href="https://twitter.com/ojiudezue" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/ojiudezue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638977536789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0uLGkdkzaYTKG8GZZmhwV3">Oji Udezue</a>, Twitter tells me.</p>
<p>DMs have long been a source of interest for Twitter observers, and some have wondered when and if Twitter would ever seek to develop them into a more standalone product (something that they&#8217;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeisaac/status/1328731018224824321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toyed with apparently</a>) and possible business line. That would make some sense, given the huge boom we&#8217;ve seen in messaging apps in recent years, and the moves so many other open-ended social media platforms have made to boost their own direct messaging businesses.</p>
<p>Now, with Twitter making more moves to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diversify its business</a>, maybe this could be an opportunity to rethink DMs too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a bittersweet ending for Quill: The company was bold both to make the assertion that business people need collaboration and communication, but not at the cost of distraction, and then to try to make the leap to build and scale a completely new product to address that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But scaling a new entrant in that space would have been tough even without the aggressive presence of a lot of other deep-pocketed, platform-squatting players in the space. Quill assembled a talented and ambitious team, so it will be worth watching what their IP, and that grouping of people, get applied to next.</p>
<p><del datetime="2021-12-07T16:05:01+00:00">We&#8217;ve asked if Pettersson is joining the flock, too, and will update this post with that and anything else we learn.</del> (Updated in story above with his new role at Twitter.)</p>
