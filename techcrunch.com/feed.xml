										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has named the person it wants to take over as its chief data protection watchdog, with sitting commissioner Elizabeth Denham <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/01/elizabeth-denhams-term-as-information-commissioner-extended/">overdue</a> to vacate the post: The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) today said its preferred replacement is New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner, John Edwards.</p>
<p>Edwards, who has a legal background, has spent more than seven years heading up the Office of the Privacy Commissioner In New Zealand &#8212; in addition to other roles with public bodies in his home country.</p>
<p>He is perhaps best known to the wider world for his verbose Twitter presence and for taking a public dislike to Facebook: In the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-just-lost-another-user-new-zealands-privacy-commissioner/">2018</a> Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal Edwards publicly announced that he was deleting his account with the social media &#8212; accusing Facebook of not complying with the country&#8217;s privacy laws.</p>
<p>An anti-&#8216;Big Tech&#8217; stance aligns with the UK government&#8217;s agenda to tame the tech giants as it works to bring in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">safety-focused legislation for digital platforms</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">reforms of competition rules that take account of platform power</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Official announcement </p>
<p>Government announces preferred candidate for Information Commissioner &#8211; <a href="https://t.co/2fri3ROyhm">https://t.co/2fri3ROyhm</a> <a href="https://t.co/i8b4OBcwzC">https://t.co/i8b4OBcwzC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Edwards (@JCE_PC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JCE_PC/status/1430779723664171009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If confirmed in the role &#8212; the DCMS committee has to approve Edwards&#8217; appointment; plus there&#8217;s a ceremonial nod needed from the Queen &#8212; he will be joining the regulatory body at a crucial moment as digital minister Oliver Dowden has signalled the beginnings of a planned divergence from the European Union&#8217;s data protection regime, post-Brexit, by Boris Johnson&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>Dial back the clock five years and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/on-data-protection-brexit-means-mirroring-eu-rules-confirms-uk-minister/">prior digital minister, Matt Hancock</a>, was defending the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a &#8220;decent piece of legislation&#8221; &#8212; and suggesting to parliament that there would be little room for the UK to diverge in data protection post-Brexit.</p>
<p>But Hancock is now out of government (aptly enough after a data leak showed him breaching social distancing rules by kissing his aide inside a government building), and the government mood music around data has changed key to something far more brash &#8212; with sitting digital minister Dowden framing unfettered (i.e. deregulated) data-mining as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">“a great opportunity”</a> for the post-Brexit UK.</p>
<p>For months, now, ministers have been eyeing how to rework the UK&#8217;s current (legacy) EU-based data protection framework &#8212; to, essentially, reduce user rights in favor of soundbites heavy on claims of slashing &#8216;red tape&#8217; and turbocharging data-driven &#8216;innovation&#8217;. Of course the government isn&#8217;t saying the quiet part out loud; its press releases talk about using &#8220;the power of data to drive growth and create jobs while keeping high data protection standards&#8221;. But those standards are being reframed as a fig leaf to enable a new era of data capture and sharing by default.</p>
<p>Dowden has said that the emergency data-sharing which was waived through during the pandemic &#8212; when the government used the pressing public health emergency to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">justify handing NHS data to a raft of tech giants</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">should be the &#8216;new normal&#8217; for a post-Brexit UK</a>. So, tl;dr, get used to living in a regulatory crisis.</p>
<p>A special taskforce, which was commissioned by the prime minister to investigate how the UK could reshape its data policies outside the EU, also issued a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994125/FINAL_TIGRR_REPORT__1_.pdf">report</a> this summer &#8212; in which it recommended scrapping some elements of the UK&#8217;s GDPR altogether &#8212; branding the regime &#8220;prescriptive and inflexible&#8221;; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/uks-ico-warns-over-big-data-surveillance-threat-of-live-facial-recognition-in-public/">advocating for changes</a> to “free up data for innovation and in the public interest”, as it put it, including pushing for revisions related to AI and “growth sectors”.</p>
<p>The government is now preparing to reveal how it intends to act on its appetite to &#8216;reform&#8217; (read: reduce) domestic privacy standards &#8212; with proposals for overhauling the data protection regime incoming next month.</p>
<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/08/25/oliver-dowden-creating-data-laws-one-biggest-prizes-brexit/">Telegraph</a> for a paywalled article published yesterday, Dowden trailed one change that he said he wants to make which appears to target consent requirements &#8212; with the minister suggesting the government will remove the legal requirement to gain consent to, for example, track and profile website visitors &#8212; all the while framing it as a pro-consumer move; a way to do away with &#8220;endless&#8221; cookie banners.</p>
<p>Only cookies that pose a &#8216;high risk&#8217; to privacy would still require consent notices, per the report &#8212; whatever that means.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;There’s an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people’s privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,&#8221; the digital minister also told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>The draft of this Great British &#8216;light touch&#8217; data protection framework will emerge next month, so all the detail is still to be set out. But the overarching point is that the government intends to redefine UK citizens&#8217; privacy rights, using meaningless soundbites &#8212; with Dowden touting a plan for &#8220;common sense&#8221; privacy rules &#8212; to cover up the fact that it intends to reduce the UK&#8217;s currently world class privacy standards and replace them with worse protections for data.</p>
<p>If you live in the UK, how much privacy and data protection you get will depend upon how much &#8216;innovation&#8217; ministers want to &#8216;turbocharge&#8217; today &#8212; so, yes, be afraid.</p>
<p>It will then fall to Edwards &#8212; once/if approved in post as head of the ICO &#8212; to nod any deregulation through in his capacity as the post-Brexit information commissioner.</p>
<p>We can speculate that the government hopes to slip through the devilish detail of how it will torch citizens&#8217; privacy rights behind flashy, distraction rhetoric about &#8216;taking action against Big Tech&#8217;. But time will tell.</p>
<p>Data protection experts are already warning of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tim2040/status/1430758650398875652">regulatory stooge</a>.</p>
<p>While the Telegraph suggests Edwards is seen by government as an ideal candidate to ensure the ICO takes a &#8220;more open and transparent and collaborative approach&#8221; in its future dealings with business.</p>
<p>In a particularly eyebrow raising detail, the newspaper goes on to report that government is exploring the idea of requiring the ICO to carry out &#8220;economic impact assessments&#8221; &#8212; to, in the words of Dowden, ensure that “it understands what the cost is on business” before introducing new guidance or codes of practice.</p>
<p>All too soon, UK citizens may find that &#8212; in the &#8216;sunny post-Brexit uplands&#8217; &#8212; they are afforded exactly as much privacy as the market deems acceptable to give them. And that Brexit actually means watching your fundamental rights being traded away.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to Edwards&#8217; nomination, Denham, the outgoing information commissioner, appeared to offer some lightly coded words of warning for government, writing [emphasis ours]: “Data driven innovation stands to bring enormous benefits to the UK economy and to our society, but the digital opportunity before us today will <em><strong>only be realised where people continue to trust their data will be used fairly and transparently, both here in the UK and when shared overseas</strong></em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lurking iceberg for government is of course that if wades in and rips up a carefully balanced, gold standard privacy regime on a soundbite-centric whim &#8212; replacing a pan-European standard with &#8216;anything goes&#8217; rules of its/the market&#8217;s choosing &#8212; it&#8217;s setting the UK up for a post-Brexit future of domestic data misuse scandals.</p>
<p>You only have to look at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/">dire parade of data breaches</a> over in the US to glimpse what&#8217;s coming down the pipe if data protection standards are allowed to slip. The government publicly bashing the private sector for adhering to lax standards it deregulated could soon be the new &#8216;get popcorn&#8217; moment for UK policy watchers&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Equifax data leak could involve 143 million consumers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/embed/#?secret=zCLX8tq4oD" data-secret="zCLX8tq4oD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>UK citizens will surely soon learn of unfair and unethical uses of their data under the &#8216;light touch&#8217; data protection regime &#8212; i.e. when they read about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Such an approach will indeed be setting the country on a path where mistrust of digital services becomes the new normal. And that of course will be horrible for digital business over the longer run. But Dowden appears to lack even a surface understanding of Internet basics.</p>
<p>The UK is also of course setting itself on a direct collision course with the EU if it goes ahead and lowers data protection standards.</p>
<p>This is because its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">current data adequacy deal with the bloc</a> &#8212; which allows for EU citizens&#8217; data to continue flowing freely to the UK &#8212; was granted only on the basis that the UK was, at the time it was inked, still aligned with the GDPR. So Dowden&#8217;s rush to rip up protections for people&#8217;s data presents a clear risk to the &#8220;significant safeguards&#8221; needed to maintain EU adequacy. Meaning the deal could topple.</p>
<p>Back in June, when the Commission signed off on the UK&#8217;s adequacy deal, it clearly warned that &#8220;if anything changes on the UK side, we will intervene&#8221;.</p>
<p>Add to that, the adequacy deal is also the first with a baked in sunset clause &#8212; meaning it will automatically expire in four years. So even if the Commission avoids taking proactive action over slipping privacy standards in the UK there is a hard deadline &#8212; in 2025 &#8212; when the EU&#8217;s executive will be bound to look again in detail at exactly what Dowden &amp; Co. have wrought. And it probably won&#8217;t be pretty.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK gets data flows deal from EU &#8212; for now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/embed/#?secret=zywh8tMe9v" data-secret="zywh8tMe9v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The longer term UK &#8216;plan&#8217; (if we can put it that way) appears to be to replace domestic economic reliance on EU data flows &#8212; by seeking out other jurisdictions that may be friendly to a privacy-light regime governing what can be done with people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Hence &#8212; also today &#8212; DCMS trumpeted an intention to secure what it billed as &#8220;new multi-billion pound global data partnerships&#8221; &#8212; saying it will prioritize striking ‘data adequacy’ &#8220;partnerships&#8221; with the US, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and the Dubai International Finance Centre and Colombia.</p>
<p>Future partnerships with India, Brazil, Kenya and Indonesia will also be prioritized, it added &#8212; with the government department cheerfully glossing over the fact it&#8217;s UK citizens&#8217; own privacy that is being deprioritized here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Estimates suggest there is as much as £11 billion worth of trade that goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers,&#8221; DCMS writes in an ebullient press release.</p>
<p>As it stands, the EU is of course the UK’s largest trading partner. And statistics from the House of Commons library on <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7851/">the UK&#8217;s trade with the EU</a> &#8212; which you won&#8217;t find cited in the DCMS release &#8212; underline quite how tiny this potential Brexit &#8216;data bonanza&#8217; is, given that UK exports to the EU stood at <em>£294 billion</em> in 2019 (43% of all UK exports).</p>
<p>So even the government&#8217;s &#8216;economic&#8217; case to water down citizens&#8217; privacy rights looks to be puffed up with the same kind of misleadingly vacuous nonsense as ministers&#8217; reframing of a post-Brexit UK as &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;.</p>
<p>Everyone hates cookies banners, sure, but that&#8217;s a case for <em>strengthening</em> not weakening people&#8217;s privacy &#8212; for making non-tracking the default setting online and outlawing manipulative dark patterns so that Internet users don&#8217;t constantly have to affirm they want their information protected. Instead the UK may be poised to get rid of annoying cookie consent &#8216;friction&#8217; by allowing a free for all on citizens&#8217; data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, starting pawaPay was to help people send and receive money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internationally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting instance would be freelancers in Ivory Coast trying to receive payment for services on a global payments platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use a bank account or card. But in places like Ivory Coast, where mobile money is prevalent, that becomes an issue.</span></p>
<h2>How big is mobile money in Africa?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the World Bank&#8217;s 2015 figures, there are over 350 million unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various inadequacies are responsible for this stat, but from banks&#8217; perspectives, no incentive drives them to actually bank these people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most unbanked people rarely earn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wage in their respective countries, so it&#8217;s difficult for banks to make money off these individuals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, opening a bank account involves many KYC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer</a>) processes for this population subset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one thing is for sure: The unbanked have mobile phones, and there are over 850 million mobile connections in Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194262" style="width: 406px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194262" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2194262" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?w=396" alt="" width="396" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194262" class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Jekesai NJIKIZANA / AFP) (Photo by JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP via Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This huge market is why mobile money is prevalent across the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecom operators using proxies bypassed the banks and created their own systems to allow people to transfer money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">securely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile phones for low or no transfer fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, individuals with phone numbers can have basic financial services such as savings and transfers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up to $500 billion flows through the mobile money market in sub-Saharan Africa yearly via the accounts of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 300 million active monthly users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This alternative financial infrastructure is one of the largest globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s also one of the most underdeveloped because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each telecom operator having its own unique mobile money product has created a fragmented infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For merchants, fragmentation means that it can be exorbitantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expensive to use at scale. </span></p>
<h2>Mobile money and card payment gateways</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay wants to position itself as a market leader in high-volume mobile money payments while delivering reliability and transparency for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its API allows these merchants to access telecom operators&#8217; mobile money systems to receive and send payments to millions of mobile money accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re making a very heavy bet on the rise of mobile money and all the complexities that arise out of mobile money and all the infrastructure that needs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around payments with mobile money at its core,&#8221; Barnwell told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And the way we&#8217;re looking at the continent, we&#8217;re looking at adoption rates for mobile money growing at an insane speed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has become quite obvious that this is a very significant financial infrastructure and there&#8217;s a lot of it that&#8217;s been missing if you want to work serious volume and businesses on mobile money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194269" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png 898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=768,328 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PawaPay</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay handles local operations, compliance, regulatory cover and bank accounts, making it simple to receive payments in a new market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be handling over 10 million transactions on its rails per week, with beta operations in 10 African countries &#8212; Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnwell tells TechCrunch that although these transaction volumes look impressive, pawaPay would have done more if not for regulatory hurdles and licensing approaches in each market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In each country, we&#8217;ve had to start from scratch with the right data to understand how they look at the space,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the licensing sheets, what kind of companies they want to license, what kind of requirements they&#8217;re looking for, how we can work quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with them to make sure that they&#8217;re comfortable with us,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the CEO states that while regulation slows down processes, it&#8217;s important for pawaPay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because many unregulated companies operate without licenses and unstable technologies, some with the intention to commit fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e&#8217;ve gone in and decided we want to be completely regulated. We want to be completely covered in all the markets, with full licensing and be a very stable reliable premium product in these markets,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various payment gateways facilitating payments for businesses in Africa, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, DPO Group, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/south-african-payments-startup-yoco-raises-83m-series-c-led-by-dragoneer/">Yoco</a>, MFS Africa and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pure mobile money play, MFS Africa is a clear competitor to pawaPay. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on addressing the unique challenges accompanying mobile money, while the others drive innovation around bank and card payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194270" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194270" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194270" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?w=680" alt="PawaPay" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png 3001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=2048,1200 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PawaPay</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa connects over 300 million mobile money wallets enabling a range of banks, telcos, money transfer operators and other financial institutions interoperability at scale in Africa through a single integration point</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay isn&#8217;t far off. Barnwell says the company connects to nearly the same number of wallets and hopes to go live across 30 to 40 telco integrations soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While East Africa (buoyed by Kenya&#8217;s M-Pesa) has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been the critical market for mobile money, West Africa is catching up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last year, West Africa recorded 198 million mobile money accounts compared to East Africa&#8217;s 293 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West African region also grew the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transaction value by 46%, to over $178 billion, and countries like Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast are leading the charge, which presents a vast opportunity for these payment gateway providers, unlike the card payments market where two </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">countries are prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although most of the attention is on card payments, the big giant in payments in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is mobile money,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay&#8217;s mobile money focus was a key reason <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/krestenbuch">Kresten Buch</a>, founder of 88mph and chairman of pawaPay, led the round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that when 88mph </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in Africa a decade ago, &#8220;one of the key drivers was that mobile money was a superior payment method to credit and debit cards when used for online payment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zagadat Capital, here&#8217;s what founder <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ajibade-oluwatosin-71616560">Oluwatosin Ajibade</a> (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Eazi">Mr Eazi</a>, a singer-songwriter and entrepreneur popular in Africa&#8217;s music scene), who also sits on pawaPay&#8217;s board, had to say about the investment:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hugely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on Africa and very familiar with the landscape, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that mobile money-focused fintech is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the most exciting places to invest but also one of the most important bridges to ensuring financial inclusion of the billions of people across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The kicker for us was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the clear mission, vision and strategy and we are confident that the pawaPay team is the best team to achieve it.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Copenhagen-based process automation platform <a href="https://www.leapwork.com">Leapwork</a> has snagged Denmark&#8217;s largest ever Series B funding round, announcing a $62 million raise co-led by KKR and Salesforce Ventures, with existing investors DN Capital and Headline also participating.</p>
<p>Also today it&#8217;s disclosing that its<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> post-money valuation now stands at $312M. </span></p>
<p>The &#8216;no code&#8217; 2015-founded startup last raised back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/leapwork-raises-10m-for-its-easy-process-automation-platform-plans-us-expansion/">2019</a>, when it snagged a $10M Series A. The business was bootstrapped through earlier years &#8212; with the founders putting in their own money, garnered from prior successful exits. Their follow on bet on &#8216;no code&#8217; already looks to have paid off in spades: Since launching the platform in 2017, Leapwork has seen its customer base more than double year on year and it now has a roster of 300+ customers around the world paying it to speed up their routine business processes.</p>
<p>Software testing is a particular focus for the tools, which Leapwork pitches at enterprises&#8217; quality assurance and test teams.</p>
<p>It claims that by using its &#8216;no code&#8217; tech &#8212; a label for the trend which refers to software that&#8217;s designed to be accessible to non-technical staff, greatly increasing its utility and applicability &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">businesses can achieve a 10x faster time to market, 97% productivity gains, and a 90% reduction in application errors. So t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he wider pitch is that it can support enterprises to achieve faster digital transformations with only their existing mix of in-house skills. </span></p>
<p>Customers include the likes of PayPal, Mercedes-Benz and BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>Leapwork&#8217;s own business, meanwhile, has grown to a team of 170 people &#8212; working across <span lang="EN-US">nine</span> offices throughout Europe, North America and Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B funding will be used to accelerate its global expansion, with the startup telling us it plans to expand the size of its local teams in key markets and open a series of tech hubs to support further product development.</p>
<p>Expanding in North America is a big priority now, with Leapwork noting it recently opened a New York office &#8212; where it plans to &#8220;significantly&#8221; increase headcount.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of our global presence, we want to ensure we are as close to our customers as possible, by continuing to build up local teams and expertise across each of our key markets, especially Europe and North America,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Christian Brink Frederiksen tells TechCrunch. &#8220;For example, we will build up more expertise and plan to really scale up the size of the team based out of our New York office over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equally we have opened new offices across Europe, so we want to ensure our teams have the scope to work closely with customers. We also plan to invest heavily in the product and the technology that underpins it. For example, we&#8217;ll be doubling the size of our tech hubs in Copenhagen and India over the next 12 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Product development set to be accelerated with the chunky Series B will focus on enhancements and functionality aimed at &#8220;breaking down the language barrier between humans and computers&#8221;, as Brink Frederiksen puts it</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe and the US are our two main markets. Half of our customers are US companies,&#8221; he also tells us, adding: &#8220;We are extremely popular among enterprise customers, especially those with complex compliance set-ups &#8212; 40% of our customers come from enterprises banking, insurance and financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, because our solution is no-code, it is heavily used across industries, including healthcare and life sciences, logistics and transportation, retail, manufacturing and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about competitors &#8212; given that the no code space has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">a seething hotbed of activity over a number of years</a> &#8212; Leapwork&#8217;s initial response is coy, trying the line that its business is a &#8216;truly special snowflake&#8217;. (&#8220;We truly believe we are the only solution that allows non-technical everyday business users to automate repetitive computer processes, without needing to understand how to code. Our no-code, visual language is what really sets us apart,&#8221; is how Brink Frederiksen actually phrases that.)</p>
<p>But on being pressed Leapwork names a raft of what it calls &#8220;legacy players&#8221; &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/23/insight-ventures-invests-165-million-in-automated-testing-startup-tricentis/">Tricentis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/smartbear-expands-its-testing-market-reach-with-zephyr-acquisition/">Smartbear</a>, <a href="https://www.ranorex.com">Ranorex</a>, <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/home">MicroFocus</a>, <a href="https://www.eggplantsoftware.com">Eggplant Software</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/mabl-announces-20-million-series-b-to-bring-automated-qa-to-enterprise-customers/">Mabl</a> and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev">Selenium</a> &#8212; as (also) having &#8220;great products&#8221;, while continuing to claim they &#8220;speak to a different audience than we do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly Leapwork&#8217;s Series B raise speaks loudly of how much value investors are seeing here.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Patrick Devine, director at KKR, said: &#8220;Test automation has historically been very challenging at scale, and it has become a growing pain point as the pace of software development continues to accelerate. Leapwork’s primary mission since its founding has been to solve this problem, and it has impressively done so with its powerful no-code automation platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The team at Leapwork has done a fantastic job building a best-in-class corporate culture which has allowed them to continuously innovate, execute and push the boundaries of their automation platform,” added Stephen Shanley, managing director at KKR, in another statement.</p>
<p>In a third supporting statement, Nowi Kallen, principal at Salesforce Ventures, added: “Leapwork has tapped into a significant market opportunity with its no-code test automation software. With Christian and Claus [Rosenkrantz Topholt] at the helm and increased acceleration to digital adoption, we look forward to seeing Leapwork grow in the coming years and a successful partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proof of the no code &#8216;pudding&#8217; is in adoption and usage &#8212; getting non-developers to take to and stick with a new way of interfacing with and manipulating information. And so far, for Leapwork, the signs are looking good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://intellect.co/">Intellect</a>, a Singapore-based startup that wants to make mental health care more accessible in Asia, announced it has raised $2.2 million in pre-Series A funding. It is taking part in Y Combinator’s current batch, which will hold its Demo Day at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The round was led by returning investor Insignia Venture Partners and included participation from Y Combinator, XA Network and angel investors like Rainforest co-founder J.J. Chai; Prenetics and CircleDNA founder Danny Yeung; and Gilberto Gaeta, Google’s director of global HR operations.</p>
<p>This brings Intellect’s total funding since it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/"> launched a year ago</a> to $3 million, including a seed round announced in December 2020 that was also led by Insignia.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based Intellect wants to lower barriers to mental health support in Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/embed/#?secret=qsli2RvTtS" data-secret="qsli2RvTtS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Intellect offered two main product suites: a consumer app with self-guided programs based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and a mental health benefits solution for employers with online therapy programs and telehealth services. The startup now claims more than 2.5 million app users, and 20 enterprise clients, including FoodPanda, Shopback, Carousell, Avery Dennison, Schroders and government agencies.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Theodoric Chew told TechCrunch that Intellect’s usage rate is higher than traditional EAP helpline solutions. On average, its mental health benefits solution sees about 20% to 45% engagement within three months after being adopted by companies with more than 5,000 employees.</p>
<p>In many Asian cultures, there is still a lot of stigma around mental health issues, but that has changed over the last year and a half as people continue to cope with the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chew said. “From individuals, to companies, insurers and governments, all these different types of people and organizations are today prioritizing mental healthcare on an individual and organizational level in an extremely rapid manner.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intellect protects user privacy with zero-knowledge encryption, so the startup and employers don’t have access to people’s records or communications with their coaches and counsellors. Any insights shared with employers are aggregated and anonymized. Chew said the company is also compliant with major data privacy regulations like ISO, HIPAA and GDPR.</p>
<p>Intellect is currently collaborating in 10 studies with institutions like the National University of Singapore, King’s College London, University of Queensland and the Singapore General Hospital. It says studies so far have demonstrated improvements in mental well-being, stress levels and anxiety among its users.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand into more Asian markets. Intellect currently covers 12 countries and 11 languages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A milestone for <a href="https://jolla.com">Jolla</a>, the Finnish startup behind the Sailfish OS &#8212; which formed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/10/can-jolla-become-meegos-saviour-ceo-plans-two-smartphones-already/">almost a decade ago</a>, when a band of Nokia staffers left to keep the torch burning for a mobile linux-based alternative to Google&#8217;s Android &#8212; today it&#8217;s announcing hitting profitability.</p>
<p>The mobile OS licensing startup describes 2020 as a &#8220;turning point&#8221; for the business &#8212; reporting revenues that grew 53% YoY, and EBITDA (which provides a snapshot of operational efficiency) standing at 34%.</p>
<p>It has a new iron in the fire too now &#8212; having recently started offering a new licensing product (called AppSupport for Linux Platforms) which, as the name suggests, can provide linux platforms with standalone compatibility with general Android applications &#8212; without a customer needing to licence the full Sailfish OS (the latter has of course baked in Android app compatibility since 2013).</p>
<p>Jolla says AppSupport has had some &#8220;strong&#8221; early interest from automotive companies looking for solutions to develop their in-case infotainment systems &#8212; as it offers a way for embedded Linux-compatible platform the capability to run Android apps without needing to opt for Google&#8217;s automotive offerings. And while plenty of car makers have opted for Android, there are still players Jolla could net for its &#8216;Google-free&#8217; alternative.</p>
<p>Embedded linux systems also run in plenty of other places, too, so it&#8217;s hopeful of wider demand. The software could be used to enable an IoT device to run a particularly popular app, for example, as a value add for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolla is doing fine,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Sami Pienimäki. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to see the company turning profitable last year officially.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general it&#8217;s the overall maturity of the asset and the company that we start to have customers here and there &#8212; and it&#8217;s been honestly a while that we&#8217;ve been pushing this,&#8221; he goes, fleshing out the reasons behind the positive numbers with trademark understatement. &#8220;The company is turning ten years in October so it&#8217;s been a long journey. And because of that we&#8217;ve been steadily improving our efficiency and our revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our revenue grew over 50% since 2019 to 2020 and we made €5.4M revenue. At the same time the cost base of the operation has stablized quite well so the sum of those resulted to nice profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the consumer mobile OS market has &#8212; for years &#8212; been almost entirely sewn up by Google&#8217;s Android and Apple&#8217;s iOS, Jolla licenses its open source Sailfish OS to governments and business as an alternative platform they can shape to their needs &#8212; without requiring any involvement of Google.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/jollas-sailfish-os-now-certified-as-russias-first-android-alternative/">Russia was one of the early markets that tapped in</a>.</p>
<p>The case for digital sovereignty in general &#8212; and an independent (non-US-based) mobile OS platform provider, specifically &#8212; has been strengthened in recent years as geopolitical tensions have played out via the medium of tech platforms; leading to, in some cases, infamous bans on foreign companies being able to access US-based technologies.</p>
<p>In a related development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/">this summer</a>, China&#8217;s Huawei launched its own Android alternative for smartphones, which it&#8217;s called HarmonyOS.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fpo2g6UZo9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/">Huawei responds to Android ban with service and security guarantees, but its future is unclear</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei responds to Android ban with service and security guarantees, but its future is unclear&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/embed/#?secret=fpo2g6UZo9" data-secret="fpo2g6UZo9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pienimäki is welcoming of that specific development &#8212; couching it as a validation of the market in which Sailfish plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily see Huawei coming out with the HarmonyOS value proposition and the technology as a competitor to us &#8212; I think it&#8217;s more proving the point that there is appetite in the market for something else than Android itself,&#8221; he says when we ask whether HarmonyOS risks eating Sailfish&#8217;s lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are tapping into that market and we are tapping into that market. And I think both of our strategies and messages support each other very firmly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jolla has been working on selling Sailfish into the Chinese market for several years &#8212; and that sought for business remains a work in progress at this stage. But, again, Pienimäki says Jolla doesn&#8217;t see Huawei&#8217;s move as any kind of blocker to its ambitions of licensing its Android alternative in the Far East.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we see the Chinese market in general is that it&#8217;s been always open to healthy competition and there is always competing solutions &#8212; actually heavily competing solutions &#8212; in the Chinese market. And Huawei&#8217;s offering one and we are happy to offer Sailfish OS for this very big, challenging market as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have good relationships there and we are building a case together with our local partners also to access the China market,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I think in general it&#8217;s also very good that big corporations like Huawei really recognize this opportunity in general &#8212; and this shapes the overall industry so that you don&#8217;t need to, by default, opt into Android always. There are other alternatives around.&#8221;</p>

<p>On AppSupport, Jolla says the automative sector is &#8220;actively looking for such solutions&#8221;, noting that the &#8220;digital cockpit is a key differentiator for car markers &#8212; and arguing that makes it a strategically important piece for them to own and control.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of, let&#8217;s say, positive vibes in that sector in the past few years &#8212; new comers on the block like Tesla have really shaken the industry so that the traditional vendors need to think differently about how and what kind of user experience they provide in the cockpit,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been heavily invested and rapidly developing in the past years but I&#8217;m going to emphasize that at the same time, with our limited resources, we&#8217;re just learning where the opportunities for this technology are. Automative seems to have a lot of appetite but then [we also see potential in] other sectors &#8212; IoT&#8230; heavy industry as well&#8230; we are openly exploring opportunities&#8230; but as we know automotive is very hot at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is plenty of general linux OS base in the world for which we are offering a good additional piece of technology so that those operating solutions can actually also tap into &#8212; for example &#8212; selected applications. You can think of like running the likes of Spotify or Netflix or some communications solutions specific for a certain sector,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of those applications are naturally available both for iOS and Android platforms. And those applications as they simply exist the capability to run those applications independently on top of a linux platform &#8212; that creates a lot of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another development, Jolla is in the process of raising a new growth financing round &#8212; it&#8217;s targeting €20M &#8212; to support its push to market AppSupport and also to put towards further growing its Sailfish licensing business.</p>
<p>It sees growth potential for Sailfish in Europe, which remains the biggest market for licensing the mobile OS. Pienimäki also says it&#8217;s seeing &#8220;good development&#8221; in certain parts of Africa. Nor has it given up on its ambitions to crack into China.</p>
<p>The growth round was opened to investors in the summer and hasn&#8217;t yet closed &#8212; but Jolla is confident of nailing the raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really turning a next chapter in the Jolla story so exploring to new emerging opportunities &#8212; that requires capital and that&#8217;s what are looking for. There&#8217;s plenty of money available these days, in the investor front, and we are seeing good traction there together with the investment bank with whom we are working,&#8221; says Pienimäki.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely an appetite for this and that will definitely put us in a better position to invest further &#8212; both to Sailfish OS and the AppSupport technology. And in particular to the go-to market operation &#8212; to make this technology available for more people out there in the market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.taktile.com">Taktile</a>, a new startup that is working on a machine learning platform for financial services companies. This isn’t the first company that wants to leverage machine learning for financial products. But Taktile wants to differentiate itself from competitors by making it way easier to get started and switch to AI-powered models.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when you could read ‘machine learning’ and ‘artificial intelligence’ in every single pitch deck, some startups chose to focus on the financial industry in particular. It makes sense as banks and insurance companies gather a ton of data and know a lot of information about their customers. They could use that data to train new models and roll out machine learning applications.</p>
<p>New fintech companies put together their own in-house data science team and started working on machine learning for their own products. Companies like <a href="https://www.younited-credit.com">Younited Credit</a> and <a href="https://october.eu">October</a> use predictive risk tools to make better lending decisions. They have developed their own models and they can see that their models work well when they run them on past data.</p>
<p>But what about legacy players in the financial industry? A few startups have worked on products that can be integrated in existing banking infrastructure. You can use artificial intelligence to identify fraudulent transactions, predict creditworthiness, detect fraud in insurance claims, etc.</p>
<p>Some of them have been thriving, such as <a href="https://www.shift-technology.com">Shift Technology</a> with a focus on insurance in particular. But a lot of startups build proof-of-concepts and stop there. There’s no meaningful, long-term business contract down the road.</p>
<p>Taktile wants to overcome that obstacle by building a machine learning product that is easy to adopt. It has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Index Ventures with Y Combinator, firstminute Capital, Plug and Play Ventures and several business angels also participating.</p>
<p>The product works with both off-the-shelf models and customer-built models. Customers can customize those models depending on their needs. Models are deployed and maintained by Taktile’s engine. It can run in a customer’s cloud environment or as a SaaS application.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can leverage Taktile’s insights using API calls. It works pretty much like integrating any third-party service in your product. The company tried to provide as much transparency as possible with explanations for each automated decision and detailed logs. As for data sources, Taktile supports data warehouses, data lakes as well as ERP and CRM systems.</p>
<p>It’s still early days for the startup, and it’s going to be interesting to see whether Taktile’s vision pans out. But the company has already managed to convince some experienced backers. So let’s keep an eye on them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Manish Lachwani, cofounder of a mobile app testing company <a href="https://www.headspin.io/">Headspin</a>, with fraud. The SEC says he <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-164">violated antifraud provisions</a>, and the civil penalties it&#8217;s seeking include a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to bar him for serving as a corporate executive or board member.</p>
<p>The DOJ, which arrested Lachwani earlier, has accused him of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/co-founder-and-former-ceo-palo-alto-based-start-technology-company-headspin-charged">one count of wire fraud and one count of securities fraud</a>, and the associated penalties if he&#8217;s found guilty are are more harsh, including, for wire fraud, a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. If he&#8217;s found guilty of securities fraud, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Both the the SEC and the DOJ say Lachwani &#8212; who led the six-year-old company as CEO until May of last year &#8212; defrauded investors out of $80 million by falsely claiming that his company, Headspin, had &#8220;achieved strong and consistent growth in acquiring customers and generating revenue&#8221; when he was pitching its Series C round to potential backers.</p>
<p>By the SEC&#8217;s telling, his fabrications were designed to help secure the round at a so-called unicorn valuation. That apparent plan worked, too, with Palo Alto-based Headspin attracting <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/02/25/headspin-hits-billion-valuation-helping-you-stream/?sh=7b328e04e26c">coverage in Forbes</a> in February of last year after Dell Technologies Capital, Iconiq Capital and Tiger Global provided the company with $60 million in Series C funding at a $1.16 billion valuation. Forbes reported at the time that the valuation was double the valuation investors  assigned HeadSpin when it closed its Series B round in October 2018.</p>
<p>The SEC also says that Lachwani was looking to enrich himself, saying he did so &#8220;by selling $2.5 million of his HeadSpin shares in a fundraising round during which he made misrepresentations to an existing HeadSpin investor.&#8221; (It isn&#8217;t clear from its complaint whether the SEC is referring to the Series C or an earlier round.)</p>
<p>The DOJ&#8217;s federal complaint suggests that Lachwani&#8217;s alleged scheming dates back to at least November 2019, when the company was fundraising. It says it was then that the success of Headspin &#8212; which helps apps and devices work in different environments around the world &#8211; was being knowingly misrepresented to investors by Lachwani.</p>
<p>More specifically, the complaint alleges that &#8220;in materials and presentations to potential investors, Lachwani reported false revenue and overstated key financial metrics of the company. . . he maintained control over operations, sales, and record-keeping, including invoicing, and he was the final decision maker on what revenue was booked and included in the company’s financial records.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the investigation that led to the DOJ&#8217;s charges, the FBI discovered &#8220;multiple examples&#8221; of Lachwani &#8220;instructing employees to include revenue from potential customers that inquired but did not engage Headspin, from past customers who no longer did business with Headspin, and from existing customers whose business was far less than the reported revenue,&#8221; says the department.</p>
<p>How far off were these collective calculations? The complaint says that ultimately, Lachwani &#8220;provided investors false information that overstated Headspin’s annual recurring revenue . . . by approximately $51 million to $55 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Lachwani&#8217;s fraud unraveled after the company&#8217;s board of directors conducted an internal investigation and revised HeadSpin&#8217;s valuation down from $1.1 billion to $300 million. Indeed, in August of last year, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/startup-headspin-to-return-funding-after-probe-of-financial-statements">reported</a> that the company was planning to lower the value of its Series C stock by nearly 80%.</p>
<p>The outlet reported at the time that Lachwani had already been replaced by another executive. That person, according to LinkedIn, is Rajeev Butani, who joined Headspin as its chief sales officer early last year.</p>
<p>Nikesh Arora, a former SoftBank president and the current CEO and chairman of Palo Alto Networks, helped lead the internal review as a then-director on the board of Headspin, said The Information.</p>
<p>The SEC says its investigation is continuing. The DOJ similarly notes in its announcement that &#8220;a complaint merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Either way, the outlook doesn&#8217;t look very promising right now for Lachwani, who, according to Forbes, previously sold a mobile cloud business to Google and wound up co-founding Headspin after Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang introduced him to Brien Colwell, a former Palantir and Quora engineer who was working at the time on a different startup.</p>
<p>Colwell remains with Headspin as its CTO. He has not been named in either the SEC or the DOJ&#8217;s complaints relating to Headspin.</p>
<p>The company itself, which says it has been cooperating with the government&#8217;s investigation, was also not charged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting to all the services and microservices that a modern cloud native enterprise application requires can be a complicated task. It&#8217;s an area that startup</span> <a href="http://solo.io">S<span style="font-weight: 400;">olo.io</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trying to disrupt with the new release of its Gloo Mesh Enterprise platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Solo has had focus since its founding on a concept known as a service mesh. A service mesh provides an optimized approach to connect different components together in an automated approach, often inside of a Kubernetes cloud native environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idit Levine, founder and CEO at Solo, explained to TechCrunch that she knew from the outset when she started the company in 2017 that it might take a few years till the market understood the concept of the service mesh and why it is needed. That&#8217;s why her company also built out an API gateway technology that helps developers connect APIs, which can be different data sources or services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until this week, the API and service mesh components of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/">Solo&#8217;s</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloo Mesh Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/solo-io-announces-service-mesh-platform-aimed-at-enterprise-customers/"> offering</a> were separate technologies, with different configurations and control planes. That is now changing with the integration of both API and service mesh capabilities into a unified service. The integrated capabilities should make it easier to set up and configure all manner of services in the cloud that are running on Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo&#8217;s service mesh, known as Gloo Mesh, is based on the open source</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/the-open-source-istio-service-mesh-for-microservices-hits-version-1-0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/the-open-source-istio-service-mesh-for-microservices-hits-version-1-0/">project</a>, which was created by Google. The API product is called Gloo Edge, which uses the open source</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/envoy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project, originally created by ride sharing company Lyft. Levine explained that her team has now used Istio&#8217;s plugin architecture to connect with Envoy in an optimized approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levine noted that many users start off with an API gateway and then extend to using the service mesh. With the new Gloo Mesh Enterprise update, she expects customer adoption to accelerate further as Solo will be able to differentiate against rivals in both the service mesh and API management markets.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the service mesh space is still emerging including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/tetrate-nets-12-1-million-to-bring-microservices-to-the-corporate-masses/">rivals such as</a></span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/tetrate-nets-12-1-million-to-bring-microservices-to-the-corporate-masses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tetrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, API gateways are a more mature technology. There are a number of established vendors in the API management space including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/kong-raises-43m-series-c-for-its-api-platform/">raised $71 million in funding</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the integration of Gloo Edge for API management into Gloo Mesh Enterprise, Solo isn&#8217;t quite covering all the bases for API technology, yet. Gloo Edge supports REST based APIs, which are by far the most common today, though it doesn&#8217;t support the emerging </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebooks-graphql-gets-its-own-open-source-foundation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/facebooks-graphql-gets-its-own-open-source-foundation/"> API standard</a>, which is becoming increasingly popular. Levine told us to &#8216;stay tuned&#8217; for a future GraphQL announcement for Solo and its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solo has raised a total of $36.5 million across two rounds, with an</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/solo-io-raises-11m-to-help-enterprises-adopt-cloud-native-technologies/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 and a $23 million Series B announced in October 2020.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the rocket launch sector is quickly becoming crowded, the same can’t be said for companies developing suborbital spaceplanes. This means there’s plenty of room to grow for startups like <a href="https://www.dawnaerospace.com/">Dawn Aerospace</a>, which has now completed five test flights of its Mk-II Aurora spaceplane that is designed to fly up to 60 miles above the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The flights, which took place at the Glentanner Aerodrome in New Zealand’s South Island in July, were to assess the vehicle’s airframe and avionics. While the vehicle only reached altitudes of 3,400 feet, the flights allowed Dawn’s team to capture “extensive data enabling further R&amp;D on the capability of Mk-II,” CEO Stefan Powell said in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194189" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194189" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194189" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg 3516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dawn-Mk-II-Aurora-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194189" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.dawnaerospace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawn Aerospace <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Dawn’s approach is to build a vehicle that can take off and land from conventional airports and potentially perform multiple flights to and from space per day. The obvious benefit of this approach is that it’s significantly less capital-intensive than vertical launches. Mk-II is also barely the size of a compact car, less than 16 feet long and weighing only 165 pounds empty, which further lowers costs.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the Mk-II is the second iteration of the vehicle, but Dawn doesn’t plan on stopping there. The company has plans to build a two-stage-to-orbit Mk-III spaceplane that can also be used to conduct scientific research, or even capture atmospheric data for weather observations and climate modeling. While Mk-II has a payload of 3U, or less than 8.8 pounds, Mk-III will be capable of carrying up to 551 pounds to orbit.</p>
<p>The Mk-II will ultimately be fitted with a rocket engine to enable supersonic performance and high-altitude testing.</p>
<p>The company hit a major milestone last December when it received an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Certificate from the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority to fly Mk-II from airports. It also received a grant from by the province of Zuid-Holland in the Netherlands, along with <a href="http://radarbasedavionics.com/">Radar Based Avionics</a> and <a href="https://www.metasensing-group.com/">MetaSensing,</a> to test a low-power sense and detect radar system. That demonstration, which is scheduled to take place next year, will happen once Mk-II undergoes some minor modifications, Powell told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Beck’s earliest memory is standing outside with his father in his hometown of Invercargill, New Zealand, looking up at the stars and being told that there could very well be people on planets orbiting those stars looking right back at him.</p>
<p>“For a three or four year old, that was a mind-blowing thing that got etched into my memory and from that point onwards, that was me destined to work in the space industry,” he said at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUZ6aOZLSf0&amp;t=1402s&amp;ab_channel=spacegeneration">Space Generation Fusion Forum</a> (SGFF).</p>
<p>Of course, hindsight is 20/20. But it’s true that Beck’s career has been characterized by an unusually single-minded focus on rocketry. Instead of going to university, Beck got a trade job, working as a tool-making apprentice by day and a dilettante rocket engine maker by night. “I was very, very fortunate through my career that the companies I worked with and worked for, and the government organizations that I’ve worked for, always encouraged — or tolerated, maybe is a better word — me using their facilities and doing things in their facilities at night,” he said.</p>
<p>His tinkering matured with experience and working double time paid off: In 2006, he founded his space launch company <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/">Rocket Lab</a>. Now, 15 years and 21 launches later, the company has gone public through a merger with a blank-check firm that’s added $777 million to its war chest.</p>

<h2>The space SPAC craze</h2>
<p>The merger with Vector Acquisition catapulted Rocket Lab’s valuation to $4.8 billion, putting it second (by value) amongst space launch companies only to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. SPACs have become a popular route to going public amongst space industry companies looking to secure large amounts of capital; rival satellite launch startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Virgin Orbit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a> have each started trading via a SPAC merger, in addition to other companies in the sector, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">Redwire</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">Planet</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic</a> (to name just a few).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vQ3z92rGWd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/beyond-the-fanfare-and-sec-warnings-spacs-are-here-to-stay/">Beyond the fanfare and SEC warnings, SPACs are here to stay</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Beyond the fanfare and SEC warnings, SPACs are here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/beyond-the-fanfare-and-sec-warnings-spacs-are-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=vQ3z92rGWd" data-secret="vQ3z92rGWd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Beck told TechCrunch that going public has been part of Rocket Lab’s plans for years; the original plan was to use a traditional initial public offering, but the SPAC route in particular enabled certainty around capital and valuation. According to a <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Rocket-Lab-Investor-Presentation.pdf">March investor presentation</a> in advance of the SPAC merger — documents that should always be taken with a large grain of salt — the future is bright: Rocket Lab anticipates revenues of $749 million in 2025 and surpassing $1 billion the following year. The company reported revenues of $48 million in 2019 and $33 million in 2020, and anticipates hitting around $69 million this year.</p>
<p>But he remains skeptical of pre-revenue space startups, or those that failed to raise capital, using SPACs as a financial instrument. “There has been a lot of space SPACs go out, and I think that there is a spectrum of quality there for sure — some that have failed to raise money in the private markets, and [a SPAC merger] is the last-ditch attempt. That is no way to become a public company.”</p>
<p>While the space industry is relatively crowded now, with companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX sending payloads to orbit and myriad newer entrants looking to join them (or, more optimistically, take their leading place), Beck said he anticipates the crowd thinning out.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s going to become blatantly obvious to investors really quickly, who&#8217;s executing, and who&#8217;s aspiring to execute,” he said. “We&#8217;re in a time where there&#8217;s lots of excitement, but at the end of the day, this industry and the public markets are all about execution. The wheat from the chaff will get separated very, very quickly here.”</p>
<h2>From Electron to Neutron</h2>
<p>Rocket Lab’s revenues have largely come from the small payload launch market, in which it’s managed to take a leading position with its Electron rocket. Electron is only 59 feet tall and scarcely four feet in diameter, significantly smaller than other rockets going to space today. The company conducts launches from two sites: Its privately-owned launch range on Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, and a launch pad out of NASA’s Wallops Island facility in Virginia (which has yet to play host to an actual Rocket Lab mission).</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is in the process of transitioning Electron&#8217;s first-stage booster to be reusable. The company has been implementing a new atmospheric reentry and ocean splashdown process that uses a parachute to slow the booster&#8217;s descent, but the ultimate goal is to catch it in the air using a helicopter.</p>
<p>Thus far, Rocket Lab and SpaceX have dominated the market, but that could change soon. Both Astra and Relativity are developing small launch vehicles — the latest iteration of Astra’s rocket is around 40 feet tall, while Relativity’s Terran 1 is in between Electron and Falcon 9 at 115 feet.</p>
<p>For that reason, it makes sense that Rocket Lab is planning on expanding its operations to include medium-lift rocketry, with its much-anticipated (and very mysterious) Neutron launch vehicle. The company has been keeping the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/">details about Neutron</a> close to its chest so far — Beck told SGFF attendees that even publicly released renderings of the rocket have been “a bit of a ruse” (meaning the image below bears little to no resemblance to what the Neutron actually looks like) — but it’s expected to be more than double the height of Electron and be capable of sending around 8,000 kilograms to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118894" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118894" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2118894" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Electron-Neutron-e1614601323411.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="875" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118894" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rocket Lab</p></div></p>
<p>“We do see a lot of people in the industry copying us in many ways,” he explained to TechCrunch. “So, we’d rather get a little bit further down the path and then reveal the work that we&#8217;ve done.”</p>
<p>Rocket Lab estimates that Electron and Neutron will be capable of lifting 98% of all satellites forecasted to launch through 2029, making the need for an additional heavy-lift rocket unnecessary.</p>
<p>In addition to Neutron, the company has also started developing spacecraft. It’s called Photon, and Rocket Lab imagines it as a “satellite platform” that can easily be integrated with the Electron rocket. The company’s already lined up Photon missions to the moon and beyond: first to lunar orbit for NASA, as part of its Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">(CAPSTONE) program</a>.</p>
<p>Two Photons were selected earlier this month for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/rocket-labs-mars-mission-gets-green-light-from-nasa/">11-month mission to Mars</a>, and Beck has publicly discussed long-term plans to send a probe into Venus’ atmosphere via a Photon satellite.</p>
<p>Beyond Photon, Rocket Lab has also locked in a deal with space manufacturing startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Varda Space Industries</a> to build it a spacecraft to launch in 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>Neutron has been designed to be human-rateable right from the start, meaning that it will meet certain safety specifications for carrying astronauts. Beck said he’s certain that “we are going to see the democratization of spaceflight” and he wants Rocket Lab to be well positioned to deliver that service in the future. In terms of whether Rocket Lab would eventually expand into building other spacecraft, like landers or human-rated capsules, Beck demurred.</p>
<p>“Never, ever say never,” he said. “That&#8217;s the one takeaway I&#8217;ve learned in my career as a space CEO.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 25, 2021. If you wanted to know just how fast the technology news cycle is running today, look no further than our lead story. You’ll note that it is a complete reversion of the week’s previously most important news item! What a world! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">OnlyFans backtracks, will allow adult content:</a> </strong>So much for all that. After igniting an online firestorm by announcing that it would end support and sale of most adult content, OnlyFans has changed course. Now it won’t block the material. For more on the topic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-policy-change-is-a-tale-as-old-as-the-internet/">the Equity podcast crew has notes</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">Warby Parker is going public:</a></strong> After a short summer lull, we could be gearing up for yet another IPO cycle. This time the lead-off hitter may be D2C eyewear purveyor Warby Parker. We’ve all heard of the company, so TechCrunch was excited to get into its numbers. Our take? It’s a very neat company, albeit one that has an interesting time defending its final private-market valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/"><strong>Headspace + Ginger:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News broke today that meditation service Headspace and mental-health-focused startup Ginger are merging to create Headspace Health. The combined entity will be worth $3 billion and have 800 employees. Headspace has long been in competition with Calm, another massive player in the meditation market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into a number of thematic pairs of startup news, Kanye West. He’s out with a gadget called the “Stem Player,” which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/kanye-wants-to-sell-you-a-200-music-gadget/">per TechCrunch</a>, is “designed to isolate stems — specific elements like vocals, bass, samples and drums” from musical tracks. It’s a somewhat neat idea. The fact that Kanye is doing it should provide it with a bit of a marketing boost.</p>
<p>From the fintech startup world today, we have two stories, both of which make us wonder <em>just how much money can heavily populated fintech verticals absorb before investors get bored?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/mexican-neobroker-flink-raises-57m-from-lightspeed-the-chainsmokers-to-boost-financial-inclusion-in-latam/"><strong>Flink raises $57M more to build the Robinhood of Latin America:</strong></a> Flink raised earlier this year, a $12 million Series A. Now it is back with a pile of new capital. Akin to how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">every VC wants to fund the next Coinbase</a>, trying to score a piece of the next Robinhood is also big business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/shares-is-a-new-stock-trading-app-with-a-focus-on-social-features/"><strong>Shares has raised $10 million to build a European consumer stock trading service</strong></a> with a social twist. Sure, there are already consumer stock trading services targeting the European market, but private-market capital is betting that there’s room for yet another. The world is going to need more active investors if all the startups hoping to serve them are going to survive.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the logistics realm this afternoon, two stories that may give you hope for a future in which having stuff brought to your house has a lower carbon footprint and, perhaps, a cheaper price point:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/wing-approaches-100000-drone-deliveries-two-years-after-logan-australia-launch/"><strong>Alphabet’s drone delivery business scales:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the news from Down Under. Wing, Alphabet’s drone delivery company, has reached the 100,000-delivery mark, it recently announced. The service is currently live in Logan, Australia, where around 300,000 folks live. Alphabet, please bring this to Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li>And<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/last-mile-robotic-delivery-firm-coco-raises-36m/"><strong> Coco has raised $36M for super-cute delivery robots: </strong></a>Somewhere in time there was a committee meeting that I missed at which it was decided that all delivery robots had to be cute. I don’t know why. Coco’s delivery robot is, however, adorable. And now very well funded thanks to capital from a Series A led by Sam Altman of Y Combinator fame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staying close to the logistics theme, here’s a pair of stories dealing with the world of digital commerce in Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network/"><strong>Membo is building an “app-based marketplace for local food producers to sell directly to consumers.&#8221;</strong></a> It’s based in Estonia and is taking part in the current Y Combinator batch. Expect to hear more from the company next week during the accelerator’s demo day event.</li>
<li>Membo will compete to some degree with a host of European “instant grocery” delivery companies that have raised some $2 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/europes-quick-commerce-startups-are-overhyped-lessons-from-china/">Picus Capital’s Alexander Kremer recently detailed</a>. The investor thinks that startup lessons from China indicate that “instant delivery is not the magic bullet to crack the dominance” of traditional grocery players.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to round us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cybersecurity-vc-funding-surges-to-a-record-11-5b-in-2021/">cybersecurity venture capital activity has reached new high</a>, and cannabis-focused startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cannabis-e-commerce-startup-jane-technologies-raises-100m-after-stellar-growth/">Jane just put together a $100 million round</a>.</p>
<h2>India’s path to SaaS leadership is clear, but challenges remain</h2>
<p>By 2030, India’s SaaS industry is estimated to comprise 4%-6% of the global market and generate between $50 billion and $70 billion in yearly revenue, according to a SaaSBOOMi/McKinsey report.</p>
<p>“With the right approach, it won’t be long before the Indian SaaS community becomes a large-scale employer of talent, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and a creator of unmatched products,” says Manav Garg, CEO and founder of Eka Software Solutions.</p>
<p>In a guest post, he lays out several key growth drivers, which include “the largest concentration of developers in the world” and the fact that “SaaS is not a winner-take-all market.”</p>
<p>Even so, the region still faces challenges, since “growth requires a growth mindset.”</p>

Per the data company, PC sales rose 17% from year-ago totals, while tablet sales went sideways. Perhaps having full-power machines is more popular than ever, as we all have more work to do than, well, ever? Regardless, the PC news is good for a host of big technology firms, including HP and Lenovo.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/hulu-launches-support-for-hdr-on-select-original-content/"><strong>Hulu launching HDR viewing for some content:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Better late than never, U.S. video streaming service Hulu started rolling out HDR content support on August 19, which “should be available to all users with HDR-compatible devices in the coming days,” TechCrunch reports. So far HDR playback only extends to certain, high-profile Hulu content.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/"><strong>South Korea delays proposed &#8220;anti-Google law&#8221;:</strong></a> If passed, TechCrunch’s own Kate Park writes, “South Korea will be the first country to prohibit such global tech giants from imposing billing systems on in-app purchases.” Apple and Google, naturally, oppose the measure.</li>

		Michael Gorman is SVP of Product, Business Development and Marketing at <a href="https://sharethis.com/">ShareThis</a>, a data company focused on mapping comprehensive global consumer interest insights.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Marketing automation has usually focused on driving sales, mainly using past purchase or late funnel behavior (e.g., paid search) as a predictor of an imminent purchase. While effective at boosting sales numbers, this widely implemented strategy can result in a disservice to brands and industries that adopt it, as it promotes the perpetual devaluation of goods or services. Narrowing a brand’s focus only to aspects linked to conversions risks stripping the customer experience of key components that lay the groundwork for long-term success.</p>
<p>We live in a world rich with data, and insights are growing more vibrant every day. With this in mind, companies and advertisers can strategically weave together all the data they collect during the customer experience. This enables them to understand every inference available during customer interactions and learn what benefits the customer most at a given time.</p>
<p>But focusing exclusively on data collected from customers, brands risk falling subject to the law of diminishing returns. Even companies with meaningful consumer interactions or rich service offerings struggle to gain impactful contextual insights. Only by harnessing a broader dataset can we understand how people become customers in the first place, what makes them more or less likely to purchase again and how developments in society impact the growth or struggle a brand will experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how we can achieve a more complete picture of current and future customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A critical component in re-imagining customer experience as a relationship is recognizing that brands often don’t focus enough on consumers’ wider needs and concerns.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Leverage AI to unlock new perspectives</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, almost every industry has capitalized on the opportunity data-driven marketing presents, inching closer to the “holy grail” of real-time, direct and personalized engagements. Yet, the evolving toolset encouraged brands to focus on end-of-the-funnel initiatives, jeopardizing what really impacts a business&#8217; longevity: relationships.</p>
<p>While past purchase or late-funnel behavior data does provide value and is useful in identifying habit changes or actual needs, it is relatively surface level and doesn’t offer insight into consumers’ future behavior or what led them to a specific purchase in the first place.</p>
<p>By incorporating AI, brands can successfully engage with their audiences in a more holistic, helpful and genuine way. Technologies to discern not just the content of language (e.g., the keywords) but its meaning as well, open up possibilities to better infer consumer interest and intentions. In turn, brands can tune consumer interactions to generate satisfaction and delight, and ultimately accrue stronger insights for future use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like so many other aspects of the robotics world, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated interest in the automated kitchen. After all, the food and restaurant industry was deemed essential amid global shutdowns, but finding kitchen staff proved a problem for many, especially early on when questions remained around COVID’s transmission.</p>
<p>This week, California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.spyce.com/spyce-sweetgreen-acquisition/">announced plans</a> to go all in on automation with the acquisition of Spyce. Founded in 2015, the Boston-based startup started making waves a few years back as a spinout of MIT mechanical engineering students. First serving up food at the school’s dining hall, the team ultimately opened a pair of automated restaurants in the Boston area. The startup notes, &#8220;our Spyce restaurants will stay open at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweetgreen plans to eventually incorporate Spyce’s technology into its restaurants. It will likely take some time to scale up to the needs of the chain, which currently operates more than 120 locations across the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194093" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194093" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194093" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Bowl-Infinite-Kitchen.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194093" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spyce</p></div></p>
<p>“We built Sweetgreen to connect more people to real food and create healthy fast food at scale for the next generation, and Spyce has built state-of-the-art technology that perfectly aligns with that vision,” Sweetgreen CEO and co-founder Jonathan Neman said in a statement. “By joining forces with their best-in-class team, we will be able to elevate our team member experience, provide a more consistent customer experience and bring real food to more communities.”</p>
<p>Like pizza, salads are a clear target for early food automation. They’re both popular and relatively straightforward to automate &#8212; essentially mixing a bunch of ingredients from different chutes into a bowl.</p>
<p>Sweetgreen is quick to note that the plan isn’t to replace employees outright, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[T]eam members will be able to focus more on preparation and hospitality moments, while having the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art technology,” the company writes. “Invest more in training and development to support team members to become Head Coaches. Interested team members will be able to develop technology-facing skills to operate and maintain Spyce technology.”</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q3. Terms were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hims &amp; Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum said Thursday that his company is in the process of distributing 10,000 primary care and mental health visits to displaced Afghan refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Hims &amp; Hers has built out a multi-specialty telehealth platform that connects consumers to licensed healthcare professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://medium.com/hims-hers/hims-hers-to-donate-10-000-primary-care-mental-health-visits-to-relocated-afghan-refugees-9ccae21b0dde"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dudum wrote that Hims &amp; Hers felt a “moral responsibility to act &#8212; and fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added: “The eyes and hearts of the world are currently and understandably focused on Afghanistan and the refugees evacuating en masse. These people are looking for the most basic of needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudum said that Hims &amp; Hers plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with select NGOs, nonprofits and other relevant partners, including translators and the providers on its platform, “to make sure refugees are aware of these services and get the urgent support they need.” The visits are immediately available to refugees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO also said that Hims &amp; Hers will be covering the cost of the medical visits but that they would be “delivered by the generous providers” through its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDudum/status/1430606813255270401?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dudum said the move was inspired by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his company planned to offer free temporary housing to 20,000 Afghan refugees around the world amid the Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies’ initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the </span><a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of earlier this week, countries had </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-evacuation-war-footing-g7-meets-pullout-deadline-2021-08-24/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evacuated around 58,700 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the country’s capital, Kabul, since mid-August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hims &amp; Hers has evolved into a telehealth platform, it also sells sexual wellness and other health products and services to millennials. The company began </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trading publicly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January on the NYSE after completing a reverse merger with the blank-check company Oaktree Acquisition Corp.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">YouTube has removed <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/tackling-misinfo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><ins>1 million</ins></a> videos for dangerous COVID-19 misinformation since February 2020, according to YouTube’s Chief Product Officer Neal Mahon.</p>
<p>Mahon shared the statistic in a blog post outlining how the company approaches misinformation on its platform. “Misinformation has moved from the marginal to the mainstream,” he wrote. “No longer contained to the sealed-off worlds of Holocaust deniers or 9-11 truthers, it now stretches into every facet of society, sometimes tearing through communities with blistering speed.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Youtube executive argued that “bad content” accounts for only a small percentage of YouTube content overall. “Bad content represents only a tiny percentage of the billions of videos on YouTube (about .16-.18% of total views turn out to be content that violates our policies),” Mahon wrote. He added that YouTube removes almost 10 million videos each quarter, “the majority of which don’t even reach 10 views.”</p>
<p>Facebook recently made a similar argument about content on its platform. The social network published a report last week that claimed that the most popular posts are memes and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><ins>non-political</ins></a> content. And, faced with criticism over its handling of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a>, the company has argued that vaccine misinformation isn’t representative of the kind of content most users see.</p>
<p>Both Facebook and YouTube have come under particular scrutiny for their policies around health misinformation during the pandemic. Both platforms have well over a billion users, which means that even a small fraction of content can have a far-reaching impact. And both platforms have so far declined to disclose details about how vaccine and health misinformation spreads or how many users are encountering it. Mahon also said that removing misinformation is only one aspect of the company’s approach. YouTube is also working on “ratcheting up information from trusted sources and reducing the spread of videos with harmful misinformation.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I received a conditional green card after my wife and I got married in 2019. Recently, we have made the difficult decision to end our marriage. I want to continue living and working in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it still possible for me to complete my green card based on my marriage through the I-751 process or do I need to do something else, like ask my employer to sponsor me for a work visa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Better to Have Loved and Lost</strong></p>
<p>Dear Better,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear your marriage didn’t work out. Rest assured, you can still proceed with getting a full-fledged green card even though you and your wife are divorcing. Listen to my recent podcast with <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, my law partner, in which we discuss the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/085-removal-of-conditional-status-for-green-card-holders/">removal of conditions on permanent residence</a> for people who got two-year green cards through marriage.</p>
<p>As you know, since you were married for less than two years when you applied for your green card through marriage, you were issued a conditional green card that is only valid for two years rather than a 10-year green card. The purpose of the I-751 is to show that the couple entered into a genuine, good faith marriage. Usually, couples must file an I-751 petition together. However, an individual may file a petition without a spouse if any of the following apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the marriage ended through annulment or divorce.</li>
<li>If the U.S. citizen spouse died.</li>
<li>If the conditional resident (and/or children) was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your divorce is not yet finalized and you don’t have a family law attorney yet, I do recommend that you work with a family law attorney, who is necessary to help streamline the process. I also recommend consulting an immigration attorney as soon as possible to prepare the I-751 filing since it can get tricky for an individual in divorce proceedings. Both need to work together and in parallel to ensure that everything goes smoothly for you with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>

<h2>When to file to remove conditions on permanent residence</h2>
<p>The I-751 should be filed within the 90-day period before your conditional green card is set to expire. I recommend filing as soon as you can within that window. Keep in mind that, if you file your I-751 petition too early, it may be returned to you. And if you file it after your conditional green card expires, you not only face having to leave the U.S., but USCIS could also deny your petition if you fail to provide a compelling reason. If you are in this situation, definitely let your immigration attorney know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A London-headquartered startup called <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/">LOVE</a>, valued at $17 million following its pre-seed funding, aims to redefine how people stay in touch with close family and friends. The company is launching <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love/id1454778314">a messaging app</a> that offers a combination of video calling as well as asynchronous video and audio messaging, in an ad-free, privacy-focused experience with a number of bells and whistles, including artistic filters and real-time transcription and translation features.</p>
<p>But LOVE&#8217;s bigger differentiator may not be its product alone, but rather the company&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p>LOVE aims for its product direction to be guided by its user base in a democratic fashion as opposed to having the decisions made about its future determined by an elite few at the top of some corporate hierarchy. In addition, the company&#8217;s longer-term goal is ultimately to hand over ownership of the app and its governance to its users, the company says.</p>
<p>These concepts have emerged as part of bigger trends towards a sort of &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=63d0e9f158df">Web 3.0,</a>&#8221; or next phase of internet development, where services are decentralized, user privacy is elevated, data is protected and transactions take place on digital ledgers, like a blockchain, in a more distributed fashion.</p>
<p>LOVE&#8217;s founders are proponents of this new model, including serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantharadocchia/">Samantha Radocchia</a>, who previously founded three companies and was an early advocate for the blockchain as the co-founder of <a href="https://www.chronicled.com/">Chronicled</a>, an enterprise blockchain company focused on the pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>
<p>As someone who&#8217;s been interested in emerging technology since her days of writing her anthropology thesis on currency exchanges in &#8220;Second Life&#8217;s&#8221; virtual world, she&#8217;s now faculty at Singularity University, where she&#8217;s given talks about blockchain, AI, Internet of Things, Future of Work, and other topics. She&#8217;s also authored an introductory guide to the blockchain with her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Pizza-No-Bullshit-Guide-Blockchain-ebook/dp/B07TYHKVLF">book</a> &#8220;Bitcoin Pizza.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schlaeffer/?locale=en_US">Christopher Schlaeffer</a>, meanwhile, held a number of roles at Deutsche Telekom, including chief product &amp; innovation officer, corporate development officer and chief strategy officer, where he along with Google execs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/23/t-mobile-g1-launch-liveblog/">introduced</a> the first mobile phone to run Android. He was also chief digital officer at the telecommunication services company VEON.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two crossed paths after Schlaeffer had already begun the work of organizing a team to bring LOVE to the public, which includes co-founders Chief Technologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-reeves-aa5b7834/">Jim Reeves</a>, also previously of VEON, and Chief Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kekeritz/">Timm Kekeritz</a>, previously an interaction designer at international design firm IDEO in San Francisco, design director at IXDS and founder of design consultancy Raureif in Berlin, among other roles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193998" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193998" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193998 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png 6210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=768,332 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=680,294 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=1536,665 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=2048,886 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Overview.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193998" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LOVE</p></div></p>
<p>Explained Radocchia, what attracted her to join as CEO was the potential to create a new company that upholds more positive values than what&#8217;s often seen today &#8212; in fact, the brand name &#8220;LOVE&#8221; is a reference to this aim. She was also interested in the potential to think through what she describes as &#8220;new business models that are not reliant on advertising or harvesting the data of our users,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>To that end, LOVE plans to monetize <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/privacy-policy">without any advertising</a>. While the company isn&#8217;t ready to explain its business model in full, it would <a href="https://www.seeyouonlove.com/blog/the-future-internet-will-be-powered-by-context-and-the-context-is-you">involve users opting in to services</a> through granular permissions and membership, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>“We believe our users will much rather be willing to pay for services they consciously use and grant permissions to in a given context than have their data used for an advertising model which is simply not transparent,&#8221; says Radocchia.</p>
<p>LOVE expects to share more about the model next year.</p>
<p>As for the LOVE app itself, it&#8217;s a fairly polished mobile messenger offering an interesting combination of features. Like any other video chat app, you can video call with friends and family, either in one-on-one calls or in groups. Currently, LOVE supports up to five call participants, but expects to expand that as it scales. The app also supports video and audio messaging for asynchronous conversations. There are already tools that offer this sort of functionality on the market, of course &#8212; like WhatsApp, with its support for audio messages, or video messenger <a href="https://www.marcopolo.me/">Marco Polo.</a> But they don&#8217;t offer quite the same expanded feature set.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193996" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193996" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2193996" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png 439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LOVE-Founders-Screenshot.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193996" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LOVE</p></div></p>
<p>For starters, LOVE limits its video messages to 60 seconds, for brevity&#8217;s sake. (As anyone who&#8217;s used Marco Polo knows, videos can become a bit rambling, which makes it harder to catch up when you&#8217;re behind on group chats.) In addition, LOVE allows you to both watch the video content as well as read the real-time transcription of what&#8217;s being said &#8212; the latter which comes in handy not only for accessibility&#8217;s sake, but also for those times you want to hear someone&#8217;s messages but aren&#8217;t in a private place to listen or don&#8217;t have headphones. Conversations can also be translated into 50 languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the traditional communication or messenger products are coming from a paradigm that has always been text-based,&#8221; explains Radocchia. &#8220;We&#8217;re approaching it completely differently. So while other platforms have a lot of the features that we do, I think that&#8230;the perspective that we&#8217;ve approached it has completely flipped it on its head,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;As opposed to bolting video messages on to a primarily text-based interface, [LOVE is] actually doing it in the opposite way and adding text as a sort of a magically transcribed add-on &#8212; and something that you never, hopefully, need to be typing out on your keyboard again,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s user interface, meanwhile, has been designed to encourage eye-to-eye contact with the speaker to make conversations feel more natural. It does this by way of design elements where bubbles float around as you&#8217;re speaking and the bubble with the current speaker grows to pull your focus away from looking at yourself. The company is also working with the curator of <a href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/">Serpentine Gallery</a> in London, Hans Ulrich-Obrist, to create new filters that aren&#8217;t about beautification or gimmicks, but are instead focused on introducing a new form of visual expression that makes people feel more comfortable on camera.</p>
<p>For the time being, this has resulted in a filter that slightly abstracts your appearance, almost in the style of animation or some other form of visual arts.</p>
<p>The app claims to use end-to-end encryption and the automatic deletion of its content after seven days &#8212; except for messages you yourself recorded, if you&#8217;ve chosen to save them as &#8220;memorable moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our commitments is to privacy and the right-to-forget,&#8221; says Radocchia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be or need to be storing any of this information.&#8221;</p>
<p>LOVE has been soft-launched on the App Store, where it&#8217;s been used with a number of testers and is working to organically grow its user base through an onboarding invite mechanism that asks users to invite at least three people to join. This same onboarding process also carefully explains why LOVE asks for permissions &#8212; like using speech recognition to create subtitles.</p>
<p>LOVE says its valuation is around $17 million USD following pre-seed investments from a combination of traditional startup investors and strategic angel investors across a variety of industries, including tech, film, media, TV and financial services. The company will raise a seed round this fall.</p>
<p>The app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love/id1454778314">currently available on iOS</a>, but an Android version will arrive later in the year. (Note that LOVE does not currently support the iOS 15 beta software, where it has issues with speech transcription and in other areas. That should be resolved next week, following an app update now in the works.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after Elastic announced the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/elastic-acquires-build-security-for-security-policy-definition-and-enforcement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of build.security, the company is making yet another security acquisition. As part of its second-quarter earnings announcement this afternoon, Elastic disclosed that it is acquiring Vancouver, Canada based security vendor CMD. Financial terms of the deal are not being publicly disclosed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cmd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s technology provides runtime security for cloud infrastructure, helping organizations gain better visibility into processes that are running. The startup was founded in 2016 and has raised $21.6 million in funding to date. The company&#8217;s last round was a </span><a href="https://medium.com/cmd-security/changing-cybersecurity-announcing-our-15-million-funding-led-by-gv-81bd27e18610"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was announced in 2019, led by</span><a href="https://www.gv.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GV.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic CEO and co-founder Shay Banon told TechCrunch that his company will be welcoming the employees of CMD into his company, but did not disclose precisely how many would be coming over. CMD CEO and co-founder Santosh Krishan and his fellow co-founder Jake King will both be taking executive roles within Elastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both build.security and CMD are set to become part of Elastic&#8217;s security organization. The two technologies will be integrated into the Elastic Stack platform that provides visibility into what an organization is running, as well as security insights to help limit risk.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banon explained that, as organizations increasingly move to the cloud and make use of Kubernetes, they are looking for more layers of introspection and protection for Linux. That&#8217;s where CMD&#8217;s technology comes in. CMD’s security service is built with an open source technology known as</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With eBPF, it&#8217;s possible to hook into a Linux operating system for visibility and security control. Work is currently ongoing to extend eBPF for Windows workloads, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMD isn&#8217;t the only startup that has been building based on eBP. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isovalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/with-29m-in-funding-isovalent-launches-its-cloud-native-networking-and-security-platform-based-on-ebpf-and-cilium/">$29 million Series A round</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz and Google in November 2020, is also active in the space. The Linux Foundation also recently announced the creation of an</span><a href="https://ebpf.io/members/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eBPF Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the participation of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix and Isovalent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, Banon sees a clear alignment between what CMD was building and what Elastic aims to deliver for its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a saying at Elastic &#8211; while you observe, why not protect?&#8221; Banon said. &#8220;With CMD if you look at everything that they do, they also have this deep passion and belief that it starts with observability. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take time for Elastic to integrate the CMD technology into the Elastic Stack, though it won&#8217;t be too long. Banon noted that one of the benefits of acquiring a startup is that it&#8217;s often easier to integrate than a larger, more established vendor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With all of these acquisitions that we make we spend time integrating them into a single product line,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means Elastic needs to take the technology that other companies have built and fold it into its stack and that sometimes can take time, Banon explained. He noted that it took two years to integrate the Endgame technology after that acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Typically that lends itself to us joining forces with smaller companies with really innovative technology that can be more easily taken and integrated into our stack,&#8221; Banon said.</span></p>

<p>The End-of-Life Services by Astroscale-demonstration (ELSA-d) mission was launched in March, with the goal of validating the company’s orbital debris removal tech. The demonstrator package, which was sent up on a Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan, included two separate spacecraft: a “servicer” designed to remove space junk, and a “client” that poses as said space junk.</p>

<p>“A major challenge of debris removal, and on-orbit servicing in general, is docking with or capturing a client object; this test demonstration served as a successful validation of ELSA-d’s ability to dock with a client, such as a defunct satellite,” the company explained.</p>
<p>The demonstration today showed that the servicer &#8212; a model of Astroscale’s future product &#8212; can successfully magnetically capture and release other spacecraft.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end for the ELSA-d demonstration mission; the servicer and client still must hit three more capture-and-release milestones before Astroscale can call it a complete success. Next up, the servicer must safely release the client and re-capture it from a greater distance away. After that, Astroscale will attempt the same release-and-capture process, but this time with the client satellite simulating an uncontrolled, tumbling space object. The final capture demonstration the company is calling “diagnosis and client search,” in which the servicer will inspect the client from a close distance, move away, then approach and re-capture.</p>

<p>Astroscale is one of a suite of companies working on the problem of orbital debris, but it’s the first to send up a debris removal demonstration mission. According to NASA, over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network sensors. The amount of junk in space is only anticipated to grow as the cost of launching a spacecraft, and other expenses, continue to decline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is affecting farming all over the world, and solutions are seldom simple. But if you could plant crops that resisted the heat, cold or drought instead of moving a thousand miles away, wouldn&#8217;t you? <a href="https://www.avalo.ai/">Avalo</a> helps plants like these become a reality using AI-powered genome analysis that can reduce the time and money it takes to breed hardier plants for this hot century.</p>
<p>Founded by two friends who thought they&#8217;d take a shot at a startup before committing to a life of academia, Avalo has a very direct value proposition, but it takes a bit of science to understand it.</p>
<p>Big seed and agriculture companies put a lot of work into creating better versions of major crops. By making corn or rice ever so slightly more resistant to heat, insects, drought or flooding, they can make huge improvements to yields and profits for farmers, or alternatively make a plant viable to grow somewhere it couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are big decreases to yields in equatorial areas — and it&#8217;s not that corn kernels are getting smaller,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Brendan Collins. &#8220;Farmers move upland because salt water intrusion is disrupting fields, but they run into early spring frosts that kill their seedlings. Or they need rust resistant wheat to survive fungal outbreaks in humid, wet summers. We need to create new varieties if we want to adapt to this new environmental reality.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To make those improvements in a systematic way, researchers emphasize existing traits in the plant; this isn&#8217;t about splicing in a new gene but bringing out qualities that are already there. This used to be done by the simple method of growing several plants, comparing them, and planting the seeds of the one that best exemplifies the trait — like Mendel in Genetics 101.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, we have sequenced the genome of these plants and can be a little more direct. By finding out which genes are active in the plants with a desired trait, better expression of those genes can be targeted for future generations. The problem is that doing this still takes a long time — as in a decade.</p>
<p>The difficult part of the modern process stems (so to speak) from the issue that <em>traits</em>, like survival in the face of a drought, aren&#8217;t just single genes. They may be any number of genes interacting in a complex way. Just as there&#8217;s no single gene for becoming an Olympic gymnast, there isn&#8217;t one for becoming drought-resistant rice. So when the companies do what are called genome-wide association studies, they end up with hundreds of candidates for genes that contribute to the trait, and then must laboriously test various combinations of these in living plants, which even at industrial rates and scales takes years to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ability to just find genes and then do something with them is actually pretty limited as these traits become more complicated,&#8221; said Mariano Alvarez, co-founder and CSO of Avalo. &#8220;Trying to increase the efficiency of an enzyme is easy, you just go in with CRISPR and edit it — but increasing yield in corn, there are thousands, maybe millions of genes contributing to that. If you&#8217;re a big strategic [e.g., Monsanto] trying to make drought-tolerant rice, you&#8217;re looking at 15 years, 200 million dollars … it&#8217;s a long play.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is where Avalo steps in. The company has built a model for simulating the effects of changes to a plant&#8217;s genome, which they claim can reduce that 15-year lead time to two or three and the cost by a similar ratio.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was to create a much more realistic model for the genome that&#8217;s more evolutionarily aware,&#8221; said Collins. That is, a system that models the genome and genes on it that includes more context from biology and evolution. With a better model, you get far fewer false positives on genes associated with a trait, because it rules out far more as noise, unrelated genes, minor contributors and so on.</p>
<p>He gave the example of a cold-tolerant rice strain that one company was working on. A genomewide association study found 566 &#8220;genes of interest,&#8221; and to investigate each costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $40,000 due to the time, staff and materials required. That means investigating this one trait might run up a $20 million tab over several years, which naturally limits both the parties who can even attempt such an operation, and the crops that they will invest the time and money in. If you expect a return on investment, you can&#8217;t spend that kind of cash improving a niche crop for an outlier market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to democratize that process,&#8221; said Collins. In that same body of data relating to cold-tolerant rice, &#8220;We found 32 genes of interest, and based on our simulations and retrospective studies, we know that all of those are truly causal. And we were able to grow 10 knockouts to validate them, three in a three-month period.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193984" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193984" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2193984 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png" alt="" width="1000" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-stats.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193984" class="wp-caption-text">In each graph, dots represent confidence levels in genes that must be tested. The Avalo model clears up the data and selects only the most promising ones. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>To unpack the jargon a little there, from the start Avalo&#8217;s system ruled out more than 90% of the genes that would have had to be individually investigated. They had high confidence that these 32 genes were not just related, but causal — having a real effect on the trait. And this was borne out with brief &#8220;knockout&#8221; studies, where a particular gene is blocked and the effect of that studied. Avalo calls its method &#8220;gene discovery via informationless perturbations,&#8221; or GDIP.</p>
<p>Part of it is the inherent facility of machine learning algorithms when it comes to pulling signal out of noise, but Collins noted that they needed to come at the problem with a fresh approach, letting the model learn the structures and relationships on its own. And it was also important to them that the model be explainable — that is, that its results don&#8217;t just appear out of a black box but have some kind of justification.</p>
<p>This latter issue is a tough one, but they achieved it by systematically swapping out genes of interest in repeated simulations with what amount to dummy versions, which don&#8217;t disrupt the trait but do help the model learn what each gene is contributing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193983" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193983" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2193983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg 2739w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1199 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/avalo-founders.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2193983" class="wp-caption-text">Avalo co-founders Mariano Alvarez (left) and Brendan Collins by a greenhouse. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Avalo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Using our tech, we can come up with a minimal predictive breeding set for traits of interest. You can design the perfect genotype in silico [i.e., in simulation] and then do intensive breeding and watch for that genotype,&#8221; said Collins. And the cost is low enough that it can be done by smaller outfits or with less popular crops, or for traits that are outside possibilities — since climate change is so unpredictable, who can say whether heat- or cold-tolerant wheat would be better 20 years from now?</p>
<p>&#8220;By reducing the capital cost of undertaking this exercise, we sort of unlock this space where it&#8217;s economically viable to work on a climate-tolerant trait,&#8221; said Alvarez.</p>
<p><span class="il">Avalo</span> is partnering with several universities to accelerate the creation of other resilient and sustainable plants that might never have seen the light of day otherwise. These research groups have tons of data but not a lot of resources, making them excellent candidates to demonstrate the company&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>The university partnerships will also establish that the system works for &#8220;fairly undomesticated&#8221; plants that need some work before they can be used at scale. For instance it might be better to supersize a wild grain that&#8217;s naturally resistant to drought instead of trying to add drought resistance to a naturally large grain species, but no one was willing to spend $20 million to find out.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, they plan to offer the data handling service first, one of many startups offering big cost and time savings to slower, more established companies in spaces like agriculture and pharmaceuticals. With luck Avalo will be able to help bring a few of these plants into agriculture and become a seed provider as well.</p>
<p>The company just emerged from the IndieBio accelerator a few weeks ago and has already secured $3 million in seed funding to continue their work at greater scale. The round was co-led by Better Ventures and Giant Ventures, with At One Ventures, Climate Capital, David Rowan and of course IndieBio parent SOSV participating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brendan convinced me that starting a startup would be way more fun and interesting than applying for faculty jobs,&#8221; said Alvarez. &#8220;And he was totally right.&#8221;</p>
