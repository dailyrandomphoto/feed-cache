										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there was ever a rubber-meets road moment for six-year-old app Gale Healthcare Solutions, it’s probably right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale Healthcare Solutions, founded in 2016, matches nurses with available work shifts. A hospital or clinic posts available shifts, then nurses can peruse opportunities, claim open spots, and be paid the same day through the platform. This network of nurses now stretches to 40,000, CEO and founder Tony Braswell tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, Gale Healthcare Solutions has been entirely self funded. But on Wednesday, the company announced a $60 million dollar growth equity investment from FTV capital. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have arguably the largest network of nurses in the United States for this for this type of platform,” Richard Liu, a partner at FTV Capital, tells TechCrunch. But the firm was also drawn to Gale because of Braswell’s own experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tony has been doing healthcare staffing for three decades and so he&#8217;s built up a ton of this industry domain knowledge,” Liu continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell comes to Gale Healthcare Solutions after 30 years in healthcare staffing. He made phone calls, sent emails, and crafted texts constantly looking to fill temporary nursing shifts. But about six years ago, Braswell realized he was going about things the wrong way. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon comes to my house every day and the typical staffing company calls people every day. That&#8217;s not efficient. So we built technology,&#8221; Braswell says.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequate nurse staffing is increasingly recognized as a major driver of patient well-being. For instance, </span><a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/26/7/559"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across acute care hospitals in England, Belgium, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Switzerland found that for every 10 percent reduction in the proportion of professional nurses at a hospital, resulted in an 11 percent increase in odds of death. </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa012247?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies from the US</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29455061/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Korea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also linked higher nursing staff to better patient outcomes. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Findings like this have led to legislation in California, for instance, that actually mandates that hospitals maintain a </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2004/rpt/2004-r-0212.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of nurses per patient, depending on the type of care being provided. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you zoom out, there is also a clear shortage of nurses filling shifts in general. </span><a href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bureau-health-workforce/data-research/nchwa-hrsa-nursing-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the US Department of Health and Human Services projects that seven states will significant nursing shortages by 2030. California, for instance, is estimated to have a nursing shortage of over 44,000. Texas will have a shortage of 15,900, and New Jersey, a shortage of around 11,400 full-time nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has only accelerated things as healthcare workers face immensely heavy patient loads on </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/the-mass-exodus-of-americas-health-care-workers/620713/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fewer physical and emotional resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are already staffing agencies geared towards filling the empty nurse shifts (estimates for the temporary healthcare worker market size </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-healthcare-staffing-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hover around</span></a> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/14/2367100/0/en/Global-Healthcare-Staffing-Market-to-Reach-US-47-8-Billion-by-the-Year-2026.html#:~:text=The%20Healthcare%20Staffing%20market%20in,share%20in%20the%20global%20market."><span style="font-weight: 400;">19-20 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) But with a problem as pressing (and large) as nursing shortages, you’re likely to have more than tech-centric startup looking to solve it. And when it comes to matching nurses with shifts, there are other players in the space. Specifically IntelyCare, another app which matches nurses and shifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braswell, through his experience, notes that being able to find positions quickly and easily is a big part of making it work as a temporary nurse. But the company is also looking to create a more stable form of gig work that offers certain perks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gale nurses are W-2 employees with the option of a healthcare benefits package. But Gale’s distinguishing characteristic is same-day pay. Braswell has been fronting the money to enable this feature (“there’s a lot of float there,” he notes). But he sees it as an essential piece of making Gale work for temporary healthcare staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t tell you how many nurses contact me personally, out of 40,000, who need $25 for gas money,” he says. Unfortunately, a lot of nurses are in that situation. This empowers that nurse to work when she wants to work, and get paid when she wants to get paid.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite fronting the money for same-day paychecks, both Liu and Braswell note that Gale Healthcare Solutions is currently profitable. The company earns revenue from taking a percentage of nurse earnings – though neither Braswell nor Liu would disclose the percentage. Though, says Liu, the fee is in line with “industry standard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That is something to note, as traditional healthcare staffing agencies have been </span><a href="https://www.aha.org/2021-11-15-white-house-urged-investigate-price-gouging-staffing-agencies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of price-gouging in response to the pandemic by some lawmakers. But Liu puts Gale’s position bluntly: “Gale never did that.”) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of Gale’s history and future growth, Branswell, as a founder, wasn’t initially interested in pursuing venture capital. But now, he feels the time is right, largely, for technical expertise and further connections. Liu also notes that FTV has focused on building out the technical capacity of Gale with this current round – specifically he’s looking to evolve the platform, and provide more tools for hospitals and nurses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with that growing technology, it’s possible Gale might eye more than just nurse staffing. Braswell has his eyes set on expanding the idea of easily accessible, same-day-pay gig work across other jobs in healthcare facilities: like housekeeping, laundry or cooks. Liu, for his part, will also focus on expanding Gale’s network of 40,000 nurses into more states. They’re in about 38 right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With network models, you know, increased density increases the fill rates, right, which are important in this industry,” Liu says. </span></p>

<p>Instead of talking about what the public markets are doing and how their moves may impact startup valuations, we&#8217;re going to ask when VCs will hit the brakes.</p>

This resulted in the assembly of larger, more rapid venture capital funds, and larger, more rapid startup funding events.</p>
<p>The result of both was that startups got expensive as hell to buy into during their growth curve.</p>
<p>Not everyone is thrilled. Venture capitalists are hardly celebrating paying 75x, 150x, or even greater multiples for shares in nascent startups. But the game was set by rules external to the players, meaning that the venture crew has merely responded to in-market incentives in recent years.</p>
<p>The question before us &#8212; and it&#8217;s perhaps the most important question in startup land for the next few years &#8212; is what happens next. The incentives that venture capitalists followed for the last decade or so are finally changing, with the price of money expected to rise sharply this year (due to tightening monetary policy generally). This has led to the anticipated result &#8212; falling valuations for riskier stocks like richly valued technology shares.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that there is an inverse relationship between the price of money (where interest rates are set by key central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve) and the value of startup <em>exit</em> prices.</p>
<p>This is simple to understand: Startups are priced first on hope (seed-stage), then momentum (Series A through C), and later by exit comps (late-stage). The startup exits that truly matter to venture funds tend to be post-late-stage, so we care most about how upstart tech companies are valued by their public market analogs. This means that more expensive money makes bonds and other, comparatively safer investments more valuable as startups lose in-market pricing power. So, up goes the price of money, down goes the exit value of startups.</p>
<p>This should impact earlier-stage startup prices in time, but we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/software-stocks-give-up-even-more-ground/">tread that ground before</a>.</p>
<p>All that in hand, when will venture capitalists tap the brakes? From where I sit today, the answer is clearly <em>not yet</em>. This is for two reasons:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security — as in &#8220;hey you, you can&#8217;t go in there&#8221; — quickly becomes a complex, arguably impossible job once you get past a few buildings and cameras. Who can watch everywhere at once, and send someone in time to prevent a problem? <a href="https://ambient.ai/">Ambient.ai</a> isn&#8217;t the first to claim that AI can, but they may be the first to actually pull it off at scale — and they&#8217;ve raised $52 million to keep growing.</p>
<p>The problem with today&#8217;s processes is the sort of thing anybody can point out. If you&#8217;ve got a modern company or school campus with dozens or hundreds of cameras, they produce so much footage and data that even a dedicated security team will have trouble keeping up with it. As a consequence, not only are they likely to miss an important event as it happens, but they&#8217;re also up to their ears in false alarms and noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Victims are always looking at the cameras, expecting that someone is coming to help them&#8230; but it just isn&#8217;t the case,&#8221; CEO and co-founder of Ambient.ai, Shikhar Shrestha, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Best case is you wait for the incident to happen, you go and pull the video, and you work from there. We have the cameras, we have the sensors, we have the officers — what&#8217;s missing is the brain in the middle.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259148" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Obviously Shrestha&#8217;s company is looking to provide the brain: a central visual processing unit for live security footage that can tell when something&#8217;s going wrong and immediately tell the right people. But without the bias that threatens such endeavors, and no facial recognition.</p>
<p>Others have made inroads on this particular idea before now, but so far none has seen serious adoption. The first generation of automatic image recognition, Shrestha said, was simple motion detection, little more than checking whether pixels were moving around on the screen — with no insight into whether it was a tree or a home invader. Next came the use of deep learning to do object recognition: identifying a gun in hand or a breaking window. This proved useful but limited and somewhat high maintenance, needing lots of scene- and object-specific training.</p>
<p>&#8220;The insight was, if you look at what humans do to understand a video, we take lots of other information: is the person sitting or standing? Are they opening a door, are they walking or running? Are they indoors or outdoors, daytime or nighttime? We bring all that together to create a kind of comprehensive understanding of the scene,&#8221; Shrestha explained. &#8220;We use computer vision intelligence to mine the footage for a whole range of events. We break down every task and call it a primitive: interactions, objects, etc, then we combine those building blocks to create a &#8216;signature.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259192" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259192" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259192" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ambientai-shot.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259192" class="wp-caption-text">The Ambient.ai system uses elements of behavior and plugs them into each other to tell whether they&#8217;re a problem.</p></div></p>
<p>A signature may be something like &#8220;a person sitting in their car for a long time at night,&#8221; or &#8220;a person standing by a security checkpoint not interacting with anyone,&#8221; or any number of things. Some have been tweaked and added by the team, some have been arrived at independently by the model, which Shrestha descrbed as &#8220;kind of a managed semi-supervised approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The benefit of using an AI to monitor a hundred video streams at once is plain even if you were to assume that said AI is only, say, 80 percent as good as a human at spotting something bad happening. With no such shortcomings as distraction, fatigue, or only having two eyes, an AI can apply that level of success without limits on time or feed number, meaning the chance of success is actually quite high.</p>
<p>But the same might have been said of a proto-AI system from a few years ago that was only looking for guns. What Ambient.ai is aiming for is something more comprehensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the platform around the idea of privacy by design,&#8221; Shrestha said. With AI-powered security, &#8220;people just assume facial recognition is part of it, but with our approach you have this large number of signature events, and you can have a risk indicator without having to do facial recognition. You don&#8217;t just have one image and one model that says what&#8217;s happening &#8211; we have all these different blocks that allow you to get more descriptive in the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Essentially this is done by keeping each individual recognized activity bias-free to begin with. For instance, whether someone is sitting or standing, or how long they&#8217;ve been waiting outside a door — if each of these behaviors can be audited and found to be detected across demographics and groups, then the sum of such inferences must likewise be free of bias. In this way the system structurally reduces bias.</p>
<p>It must however be said that bias is insidious and complex, and our ability to recognize it and mitigate it lags behind the state of the art. Nevertheless it seems intuitively true that, as Shrestha put it, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have an inference category for something that can be biased, there&#8217;s no way for bias to come in that way.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope so!</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen a few startups come and go along these lines, so it&#8217;s important for these ideas to be demonstrated on the record. And despite keeping relatively quiet about itself, Ambient.ai has a number of active customers that have helped prove out its product hypothesis. Of course the last couple years haven&#8217;t exactly been business as usual&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to imagine &#8220;five of the largest US tech companies by market cap&#8221; would both be customers (and they are) if it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>One test at an unnamed &#8220;Fortune 500 Technology Company&#8221; was looking to reduce &#8220;tailgating,&#8221; where someone enters a secured area right behind another person authorized to do so. If you think no one does this, well, they identified 2,000 incidents the first week. But by sending GIFs of the events in near real time to security, who presumably went and wagged their fingers at the offenders, that number was reduced to 200 a week. Now it&#8217;s 10 a week, probably by people like me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259191" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259191" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259191" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg" alt="Illustration of ambient.ai's interface, showing detected events like falls and active shooters." width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259191" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ambient.ai</p></div></p>
<p>In another test case Ambient.ai documented, a school&#8217;s security cameras caught someone scaling the fence after hours. The security head was sent the footage immediately and called the cops. Turns out the guy had priors. The point I take here is not that we need to lock down our school campuses and this will help do that, but something else mentioned in the document, which is that the system can combine the knowledge of &#8220;someone is climbing a fence&#8221; with other stuff, like &#8220;this happens a lot a bit before 8:45,&#8221; so kids taking a shortcut don&#8217;t get the cops called on them. And the AI could also discern between climbing, falling, and loitering, which in different circumstances might matter, or not.</p>
<p>Ambient.ai claims that part of the system&#8217;s flexibility is in all these &#8220;primitives&#8221; being easy to rearrange depending on the needs of the site — maybe you truly don&#8217;t care if someone climbs a fence, unless they fall — as well as being able to learn new situations: &#8220;Ah, so this is what it looks like when someone is cutting a fence.&#8221; The team currently has about 100 suspicious behavior &#8220;signatures&#8221; and hopes to double that over the next year.</p>
<p>Making the existing security personnel more effective by giving them more control over what blows up their phone or radio saves time and improves outcomes (Ambient.ai says it reduces the number of common alarms in general by 85-90 percent). And AI-powered categorization of footage helps with records and archives as well. Saying &#8220;download all footage of people climbing a fence at night&#8221; is a lot easier than scrubbing through 5,000 hours manually.</p>
<p>The $52M round was led by a16z, but there&#8217;s also a bit of a who&#8217;s-who in the individual investor pile: Ron Conway, Ali Rowghani from Y Combinator, Okta co-founder Frederick Kerrest, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz, Microsoft CVP Charles Dietrick, and several others who know of what they invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time; security practitioners are expected to do a lot more. The basic proposal of not having to have someone watching all these feeds is universal,&#8221; said Shrestha. &#8220;We spend so much money on security, $120 billion&#8230; it&#8217;s crazy that the outcomes aren&#8217;t there — we don&#8217;t prevent incidents. It feels like all roads are leading to convergence. We want to be a platform that an organization can adopt and future-proof their security.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace connecting employers with a skilled pool of workers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nowsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nowsta</a> attracted venture capital for its approach to help employers better engage with their hourly workforces in this increasingly hybrid work environment.</p>
<p>The company announced today $41 million in Series B funding in a round led by GreatPoint Ventures that brings the company’s total funding raised to date to $59 million. Joining GreatPoint in the financing were VMG Catalyst, Rally Ventures, Tribe Capital and existing investors Green Visor Capital, Compound Ventures and Clocktower Technology Ventures.</p>
<p>CEO Nick Lillios founded Nowsta in 2015 and spent the next year-and-a-half building the technology that arose out of his experience working with food service vendors in New York. The operational complexity of hourly workforces was the inspiration for the company’s technology, an answer to current workforce management solutions that were not able to keep up with the changing nature of hourly work, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Nowsta’s web and mobile app rolls workforce management tools, like automated scheduling, time-tracking, payroll and communication, into an all-in-one resource that includes an on-demand labor marketplace that connects employers with a skilled pool of workers sourced by trusted third-party staffing providers. There is also a wallet feature so users can get paid after every shift and see their future earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every employer is leveraging a contingent workforce and trying to use 1099 workers to fill in the gaps,” Lillios told TechCrunch. “Our marketplace matches employers in need with employees, and you can see how they have been trained and vetted so employers can make quick decisions.”</p>
<p>The company raised an $8.1 million Series A in April 2019, which gave it the boost to create the marketplace. When the global pandemic hit, Nowsta began working with customers that had to furlough its workers, and the resource enabled the company to help customers transition employees to other jobs.</p>
<p>Lillios doesn’t believe that hourly work will go back to normal. Instead, the shift seen over the past two years will be permanent as more employees crave flexibility and more employers have access to tools and resources that help them adapt.</p>
<p>A market that used to have little technology is now flush with startups giving attention to this underserved population. Most recently we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/asknicely-frontline-workers/">AskNicely</a>, which raised $32 million in Series B funding for its employee empowering app.</p>

<p>Today, Nowsta’s technology manages over 300,000 workers each month across 600 employers, including sports stadiums, hotels, food services vendors and warehouses. As more stadiums and hotels were coming back online throughout the pandemic and needed to hire around 1,000 employees, Nowsta was able to source hundreds of workers initially, which Lillios said for some “has revolutionized their businesses and ushered in a new model of flex work.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to scale its operations across 25 new U.S. markets, double its 68-person headcount by the end of the year — it was 25 people in 2021 — and invest in product development and sales and marketing. After ramping up revenue significantly in 2021, Lillios doesn’t expect to repeat that, but does forecast the company to grow at least three to five times in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Ashok Krishnamurthi, managing partner at GreatPoint Ventures, said in a written statement: “The last two years have caused a paradigm shift in the labor marketplace, and hourly and flex work is becoming ever more prevalent. Businesses of all types now must connect easily with, and manage their on-demand workforces efficiently. The most effective way to do that is with Nowsta, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to be partnering with Nick and the team to help achieve this vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Password management platform <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=1Password+techcrunch&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">1Password</a> has closed a massive $620 million Series C funding round that raises the company’s valuation to $6.8 billion.</p>
<p>The investment was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Backbone Angels, and Accel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/">which led the company’s $200 million Series A</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/1password-raises-100m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$100 million Series B rounds</a>. Other investors taking part include CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, General Motors CEO Mary Barry, and LinkedIn chairman Jeff Weiner. The round also attracted investment from investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, Robert Downey Jr, and Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>The bumper funding round follows an impressive year of growth for 1Password. The company told TechCrunch that since its Series B raise in July last year, it has increased its paying customer base from 90,000 to more than 100,000 — adding big-name corporate subscribers including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/datadog/">Datadog</a>, Intercom and Snowflake — and has grown its internal headcount from 475 to 570 employees. This, the company says, has been driven by three things: the continuation of remote and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/epos/is-hybrid-working-the-future-of-the-workplace/">hybrid working</a>, the rapid adoption of cloud apps, and the acceleration of work-related burnout.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258728" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latter point is becoming a particularly worrying cybersecurity threat, according to the company, which found that 80% of office workers and 84% of security specialists are feeling burned out as a result of the pandemic, with 12% using the same password or just a few different passwords for everything at work as a result.</p>
<p>“We’ve found that when you have stress and burnout, two things happen,” 1Password CEO Jeff Shiner tells TechCrunch. “Firstly, people look for the easy way — when you’re overworked, you&#8217;re going to put security on the back-burner. The other side effect of stress and burnout has been a desire to change, and you see that in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/using-data-driven-techniques-to-beat-the-great-resignation/">Great Resignation</a>. That leads to security issues because all those apps and services that IT are not aware of you’re now taking with you.”</p>
<p>1Password will use its newly-raised funds to drive continued growth; the company said it plans to triple its engineering and customer support teams, to build out its business-focused Events API functionality that provides visibility into successful and failed sign-in attempts, and to finance more acquisitions.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at strategic acquisitions,” Shiner says. “We made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/1password-acquires-secrethub-and-launches-new-enterprise-secrets-management-tool/">acquisition last year with Secret Hub</a>, and we will continue to look at acquisitions and how those can help us achieve our mission and goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, though the Series C funding round provides 1Password with a substantial amount of capital, Shiner says the company has no plans for an exit &#8220;just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding will &#8220;give us the sleep-at-night ability to go after some of the big bets that we need to take,&#8221; said Shiner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mantrahealth.com/">Mantra Health</a>, a digital mental health startup focused on young adults, has raised $22 million in Series A funding led by VMG Partners. The round includes new investors New Market Venture Partners, Elements Health Ventures, 14W and Alumni Ventures. Returning investors included Canaan Partners, Global Founders Capital, Baleon Capital, Western Tech Investments and City Light Capital. This latest investment brings the company&#8217;s total amount of funding to nearly $28 million.</p>
<p>The company provides virtual mental healthcare services to college and university students in the United States. By combining clinical services with software and design, Mantra Health aims to improve the mental health of over 20 million university and college students through partnerships with higher education institutions and health insurance plans. Mantra’s care program has been deployed on 52 campuses across the country, including Penn State, Miami Dade College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
<p>Mantra Health equips campus counseling offices with a dedicated psychiatry or therapy provider to work exclusively with the school. The company says it&#8217;s not interested in replacing universities&#8217; counseling operations and instead works as a digital extension of on-campus counseling staff and provider groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded in 2018 by Ed Gaussen, Matt Kennedy and Dr. Ravi Shah. Gaussen, who is now the CEO of Mantra Health, told TechCrunch that the trio started the company out of deep curiosity around how to improve the status quo of mental healthcare for young adults. Gaussen says he has a sibling who dropped out of college in 2016 due to mental health issues and saw firsthand how difficult it was to find an appropriate provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw firsthand through that experience the chaos of finding an appropriate provider, the costs related to treatment, and so many gaps in the process of getting the right support,&#8221; Gaussen said. &#8220;I ultimately spent the majority of my time as a VC learning about this space and trying to understand what was being done to solve the multiple problems in the system. It was always a personal goal to become a founder and that curiosity turned into an obsession, which ultimately led to starting the company with Matt and Ravi.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get started with Mantra Health, students take an online assessment to learn about their care options. From there, they can schedule an initial video consultation to discuss their symptoms and treatment options. The Mantra Health provider then works with the student to develop a personalized plan that includes therapy, lifestyle changes and medication, if appropriate. Students have ongoing access to their mental health provider and also have tools to track their progress.</p>
<p>Gaussen says the company will use this latest funding to quadruple the size of its team over the next 12 months across all operations, including product development and clinical operations. Mantra Health is also going to focus on clinical investments in its virtual provider group and continue its expansion across the country. The company is also dedicating partial proceeds of this round to scale its diversity scholarship, which offers financial support to marginalized individuals who are pursuing a degree related to mental health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding future plans, Mantra Health COO and co-founder Matt Kennedy says the company plans to introduce new digital-first treatments and other services for its patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the next year or so, we’ll introduce new digital-first treatments for patients, new specialties within our provider group, and continue to expand our payment mix,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Ultimately, Mantra will have a mental wellness pathway tailored to each student from the day they walk on campus to well after graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the funding announcement, Mantra Health is debuting a new insurance referral program to support both short-term, episodic care and long-term mental healthcare needs for young adults. The program is designed to work with students&#8217; insurance as the payer instead of the school. Mantra is already in-network with Optum, Cigna, as well as other local payers, and has launched the new insurance referral program as a pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://routefusion.com/">Routefusion</a> cofounders </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/colton-seal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colton Seal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/richard-scappaticci"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Scappaticci </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/routefusion-channels-3-6m-seed/">attempted to launch a neobank in 2016</a>, but they ran into significant hurdles when trying to integrate with banks to help their customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">move money to other countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They found that in order to provide cross-border payments on their platform, they had to first navigate a “super fragmented market” filled with payment providers relying on complex, inefficient platforms, Seal told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks and other financial services companies are really just risk companies. They&#8217;re not payments companies, and that&#8217;s not necessarily their fault – that could be because of regulation or whatever else. But as two outsiders kind of coming into the industry, there were so many hurdles around how to partner with a bank and how to get compliance [approval],” Seal said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in the complexities of different regulatory regimes in different countries, and one can start to see how legacy cross-border payment tools could be tough for developers to navigate. Seal and Scappaticci decided to ditch the neobank and launch Routefusion to help simplify the process instead. The company allows its customers to access over twelve different banking and foreign exchange providers through a single API (application programming interface).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259229" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I tell our [banking and foreign exchange] partners all the time, you guys are really good at building payment rails, and you&#8217;re really good at doing the compliance. But we&#8217;re really good at doing product and customer service and building awesome APIs,” Seal said, describing what differentiates Routefusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Austin-based company officially launched in 2019 and has doubled its number of customers to nearly 40 since its first institutional funding round last February, Seal said. Its customers largely use Routefusion for B2B payments today, but some also use it for remittances, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the same period, Routefusion’s revenue grew by 5,000% to a seven-figure sum, according to the company, though Seal declined to share further detail on the numbers. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion just raised another $10.5 million in a “seed prime” round, bringing the company’s total institutional funding raised to date to $14.1 million. New investor Canvas Ventures led the most recent round, with participation from existing investors including Silverton Partners and Initialized Capital and new investor Haymaker Ventures. Angel investors Sherwin Gandi (co-founder of Jeeves) and Aldrin Clement (co-founder of Novel Bank) also backed Routefusion in the “seed prime” raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to double its headcount from 20 to 40-plus employees by the end of this year, Seal said. Seal is currently focused on expanding Routefusion’s product offerings in Latin America, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and is pre-emptively exploring different markets in Africa, where he expects to see surging demand in the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routefusion is the only payments API company other than Stripe founded by two software engineers, which constitutes a competitive advantage, Seal said. He wants customers to see Routefusion “as an extension of their own team” rather than as an external payments provider removed from their day-to-day challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Lynn, who led Canvas Ventures’ investment in Routefusion, said the company’s developer-friendly approach allows it to onboard customers far more efficiently than legacy providers. As a former engineer who self-identifies as “product-oriented,” Lynn was drawn to Routefusion in part because of its positive customer feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I pay a lot of attention to what customers tell me. I can think whatever I want to think about a founder or company or product or service, but what I think doesn&#8217;t really matter – it&#8217;s what their customers think, and the customers love this company,” Lynn told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s really what sold me, because it seems like a noisy space at the top level. But when you start diving in, there&#8217;s no one really solving this middleware problem the way they are,” Lynn said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Michelle Davey was first building Wheel, a healthcare platform that helps staff clinical workforces, she had to convince investors on two visions: one, that consumers will soon demand high-quality virtual care, and two, that the behavior will change so dramatically that her startup would build vital, underlying infrastructure to scale hybrid medical workforces.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing the entire industry race towards the same direction, and that’s to serve more patients virtually &#8212; everything from traditional healthcare players like insurers to very large retailers such as Walmart and Amazon,” she said. “But, what we’ve seen in the early days of this innovation is a lot of point of care solutions…and a refragmentation of the patient experience.”</p>
<p>Davey’s vision to reinvent the back-end of virtual healthcare clicked amid the pandemic, when telehealth startups soared in usage and impact as visits went online. Soon enough, she had another evolution of her three-year-old startup: Wheel needed to evolve from an urgent care model to a more comprehensive platform that could help any program power the patient journey &#8212; from primary care to pediatrics to chronic condition management.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With hopes of providing a more holistic infrastructure to telehealth services, Wheel announced today the close of a $150 million Series C round co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Tiger Global. New investors Coatue and Salesforce participated in the round, along with existing investors CRV, Tusk Venture Partners and Silverton Partners. The company last raised a $50 million Series B in May 2021, bringing its total known funding to date to $216 million.</p>
<p>The money will help Wheel offer its platform to more companies seeking to sell holistic, virtual care service to patients. The startup wants to now be able to help patients start at a telehealth visit, but then get directed to labs, diagnostics or even an in-person visit. “While it may seem obvious, [this] transition in health care is not trivial, it requires new clinical protocols, new regulation, regulation considerations, new software and infrastructure and an entirely new workforce to deliver that care across the continuum,” Davey said.</p>
<p>Wheel isn’t the only startup with a pitch to help point-care solutions broaden their services to reach wider consumer patient population. Providers and healthcare startups have access to white-label solutions such as publicly listed Teladoc and Truepill, which have been around for a long time and have powered the operations of unicorns like Hims and Hers, Nurx and GoodRx as they look to scale in a compliant but efficient manner; simultaneously companies like SteadyMD have built an &#8220;AWS for healthcare&#8221; that combines digital recruiting with EMR integrations, doctor-patient communication channels and prescription referrals.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2PPUWwjYDx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=2PPUWwjYDx" data-secret="2PPUWwjYDx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Turnkey solutions bring up a series of questions, such as the importance of building infrastructure in-house versus outsourcing it, or if it makes sense to rely on a third-party for staffing a practice. Many startups view their clinician base as their core competitive advantage, so leaning elsewhere for sourcing takes away some of its value proposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a churn and burn third-party service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are really focused on the clinician and how do we enable them to practice at the highest value of their care. Wheel’s clinician network has grown over 60% this year, with 90% retention, she said.</p>
<p>She attests part of the retention to the fact that Wheel built its telehealth visit workflows inside one platform so clinicians wouldn’t have to patchwork different services when dealing with patients. Additionally, the scale of the platform helps clinicians access &#8220;a whole different dimension&#8221; of work, toggling between in-person care, virtual care or a flexible mix of them both.</p>
<p>To date, Wheel has helped conduct 1.3 million patient visits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Working remotely has become the norm for a lot of desk-based employees, and there have been a number of tech companies that have seen their business explode in catering to that shift. But today comes news of a different kind of startup called <a href="https://www.turingsaas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Labs</a>, which is addressing the same challenges, but as they apply to people who work in laboratories. It has now raised $16.5 million in funding on the back of its growth.</p>
<p>The Series A round of funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers <span class="s1">Moment Ventures</span> and <span class="s1">Y Combinator (where it was part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/turing-cpg-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 cohort</a>)</span> and new individual investor <span class="s1">Borge Hald</span> (CEO and co-founder of <span class="s1">Medallia</span>), also participating. The investment will be used to accelerate R&amp;D, grow the engineering team, widen operations, and a further build a go-to-market organization.</p>
<p>Turing Labs&#8217; platform helps labs speed up the process of making new products. So far<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Turing has been working with companies in the consumer packaged goods space, where its technology is being used to come up with new formulations for home care products, food and drink, and cosmetics. It</span> uses AI to simulate working through different ingredient combinations for new product formulations to determine a smaller subset that actual technicians then put together &#8212; and it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will be using the investment to continue working on its own R&amp;D (adding more functionality to the platform to extend for example deeper into packaging and alternative ingredients for processed food) as well as on hiring and business development.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We initially focused on formulation but now we are moving into other areas like ingredients or packaging &#8212; anything that can be digitally simulated or optimized,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Manmit Shrimali, Turing Labs&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ajith Govind</span>it, in an interview. The opportunity is in how the whole R&amp;D game has shifted, he added. &#8220;The process used to be 90% manual but now its 90% digital.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Shrimali also</span> said the startup is also seeing a growing opportunity in moving into altogether new categories, too: for example, the rise of plant-based alternatives to, say, meat or dairy is opening the door to applying AI to come up with new foodstuffs altogether.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Turing Labs already works with some of the world&#8217;s biggest consumer packaged goods companies, it doesn&#8217;t disclose who they are publicly, but they are household names you would know well. The plan is to expand that list, as well as engagement with the companies that are already using Turing. </span></p>
<p>As we have noted when previously profiling Turing, R&amp;D labs play a specific and critical role in the world of CPG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before eventually being shipped into production, the labs are where products are discovered; tested; tweaked in response to input from customers, marketing, budgetary and manufacturing departments and others; then tested again; then tweaked again; and so on. One of the big clients that Turing works with spends close to $400 million in testing alone.</p>
<p>Even before Covid-19, R&amp;D departments were under a lot of pressure. They are seeing their budgets getting cut, while facing an increasing number of demands and variables to which to be accountable. They are still expected to meet timelines in producing new products (or often more likely, extensions of products) to keep consumers interested. There are a new host of environmental and health concerns around goods with huge lists of unintelligible ingredients, meaning they have to figure out how to simplify and improve the composition of mass-market products. And smaller direct-to-consumer brands are undercutting their larger competitors by getting to market faster with competitive offerings that have met new consumer tastes and preferences. Running through combinations of formulations, with all of the other variables involved, is a time-consuming and expensive process.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic has complicated this even further, with companies aiming to reduce time spent in physical environments, including labs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Turing Labs&#8217; approach is to solve these various challenges with AI. Not unlike other complex computational applications where machines take on the role of caus lculations and do them faster than any team of humans could do, here that concept is applied to the products that are being built or reformulated, cutting down steps to minimize what the technicians need to do. In theory this gives them the opportunity to focus on coming up with newer innovations that they can then try in different combinations, although &#8212; as is the case with any AI innovations &#8212; it will be worth watching to see how and if Turing Labs&#8217; platform eventually grows smart enough to cut the technicians out of the process altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;With rapidly changing consumer preferences, including ingredient inputs, as well as the emergence of competitive independent brands, CPG companies today are under pressure to develop new products faster and evolve their existing portfolio. Turing Labs allows users to automate the formulation process and predict outcomes, helping CPG companies bring innovative products to market faster,” said Josh Fredberg, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “Turing Labs’ ability to systemize and speed up market discovery and product formulation across CPG organizations makes it a stand-out in the industry. We look forward to partnering with the team at Turing Labs as they continue to grow.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wrangle.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wrangle</a> raised $2 million in an oversubscribed pre-seed funding to advance its technology that automates workflows, approvals and tickets so that a company can track work and provide call-to-action tasks within chat platforms like Slack.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Beta and Eniac Ventures co-led the investment, with participation from Liquid 2 Ventures, Hustle Fund, TDF Ventures and more than 20 founder angel investors.</p>
<p>Adam Smith and Adam Long founded Wrangle in 2020 and bootstrapped the remote company until now. This is the third company where they have worked together. Most recently they were COO and CTO, respectively, at Automated Insights, which was <a href="https://www.statsperform.com/press/vista-equity-partners-and-stats-acquire-automated-insights-2-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Vista Equity Partners</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While growing a startup, they saw firsthand how software could play into the new remote way of working.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get operations done when you are in the same office and with five people around the table, but when you are growing really fast, and real departments begin to emerge, you need a process to handle the team-to-team handoffs,” Adam Smith said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, as more people live in different time zones and are working with different goals and processes, that can throw a wrench in the gears. Add into that the global pandemic where everyone was home, and it separated teams further, Smith added.</p>
<p>In their research, they saw Slack direct messages and channels get busy as people dealt with up to 100 requests per week with little way to audit/track where people were in the process.</p>
<p>Wrangle is solving this problem by giving companies a new way to run operations directly in the tools where employees are already talking to each other, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work. It also gathers requests with forms, assigns and notifies people to follow-up and tracks the progress for everyone to follow.</p>
<p>Now when colleagues are assigned a task, like onboarding an employee, an automated checklist pops up, and employees check off their steps and don’t have to worry about what to do because all the work is automated for them, Long said.</p>

<p>Wrangle launched in February 2021, initially with Slack, and now more than 800 organizations have used the workflow builder to complete over 10,000 workflows. One of their customers, Reuben Doetsch, co-founder and CTO of AvantStay, started using Wrangle for bug reports and future requests.</p>
<p>“The AvantStay team has been growing rapidly and Wrangle is the tool behind the scenes that keeps our workflows on track in Slack,” Doetsch said in a written statement. “We use it for everything from processing refunds to managing changes to property listings. Wrangle saves us hundreds of hours a month while also ensuring nothing gets lost in the chaos of Slack.”</p>
<p>The new round of funding will enable Wrangle to grow its team from just the two founders, invest in product development and accelerate its marketing efforts. The tool is expanding into Microsoft Teams and will be launching a web app for building workflows and analyzing them to move the work along. The company has dozens of paying customers and is growing revenue at 20% to 30% every month.</p>
<p>Investor Karin Klein, founding partner of Bloomberg Beta, said via email that her firm looks at the future of work and how to make work better.</p>
<p>She says that as Slack and Teams become the places where more people work together, the Wrangle team has created a way to have ticketing workflows happen where the work happens without being siloed in with other products.</p>
<p>“Adam and Adam are exceptional founders who have created an easy to use approach to ticketing so we don’t have to switch between multiple applications, saving everyone time and ensuring important approvals don’t get missed,” Klein added. “The need for Wrangle is only going to grow as work remains hybrid and distributed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parallel Systems, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, came out of stealth mode on Wednesday with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build Parallel System&#8217;s second-generation vehicle and launch an advanced testing program that will help the startup figure out how to integrate its vehicles into real-world operations, according to co-founder and CEO Matt Soule.</p>
<p>Parallel Systems also intends to use the new investment &#8212; which was led by Anthos Capital and includes investments from Congruent Ventures, Riot Ventures, Embark Ventures and others &#8212; to hire about 60 engineers, most of whom will deal with software, says Soule.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s rail vehicle architecture aims to solve a few problems: carbon emissions in freight, supply chain constraints of trucking and limits of railway freight. In the U.S., <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview#:~:text=Heavy%20freight%20such%20as%20coal,length%20and%20weight%20freight%20travels)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">rail network accounts for 28% of all freight movement</a>, but most of that is bulk movement activity &#8212; large trains that move primary resources like coal and lumber. A smaller portion of rail freight movement is referred to as intermodal activity, which essentially involves moving steel containers between a range of different modes of transportation, like boats and trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rail has a lot of opportunity to grow when it comes to intermodal, and we focus on this because this is where we think there&#8217;s competition and appetite for innovation,&#8221; Soule told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Parallel&#8217;s patent-pending vehicle architecture involves individually powered railcars that can load and transport standard shipping containers as a single or double-stacked load. They can join up to form &#8220;platoons&#8221; or split off to multiple destinations while en route, which means they don&#8217;t need to hold large volumes of freight to make the service economical, although Soule says they can actually carry much more weight than trucks, which handle most freight transportation in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the unit economics of freight trains to get competitive with trucks, you need really long trains, and you&#8217;re amortizing the cost of that locomotive and crew over that one really long train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;When that becomes a problem is when you&#8217;re figuring out where to park that big train, and the answer is, not many places.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Relying on long trains to transport goods means it&#8217;s harder to do high-volume turnovers that handle all our e-commerce wonders because those trains can&#8217;t always access urban communities or ports. They require specially built, large terminals to accommodate their physical size, said Soule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our unit economics don&#8217;t depend on a very big train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;We can move in smaller platoons and rather than dwelling all day for the unloading and loading operation, we&#8217;re in and out within an hour or two, leaving room for other platoons to come in. It&#8217;s the more efficient footprint and it enables things like serving ports and creating inland port shuttle systems so you can move the containers from a seaport to an inland port, which is often a better place for trucks to go and are closer to warehousing activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to autonomy, Parallel sees the railroad&#8217;s closed network as the ideal operational design domain for safe and early commercialization of autonomous technology due to limited track access and centralized traffic control. It&#8217;s important to note, however, that while Parallel&#8217;s long-term vision seems promising, the company has yet to test on national networks &#8212; it has been testing its prototype vehicle on a small rail in Los Angeles that&#8217;s insulated from national networks.</p>
<p>Rail in the U.S. is privately owned by owner-operators, which makes it difficult for Parallel to test its vehicles and the autonomous systems running the vehicles on a large scale. Parallel is targeting private rail companies as its customers, hoping to sell or lease its tools for them to operate the service on a day-to-day basis while offering a supporting role in terms of providing and integrating the technology. Until the startup gets a legacy railroad partner on board, it won&#8217;t be able to see if its tech can handle real-world operations.</p>
<p>The early-stage company is a few years off from developing tech that could go to market, says Soule, but it has an opportunity to own this sector of the market, particularly as shippers around the world not only want faster freight, but also cleaner freight.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platoon technology features self-propelled rail cars that push against each other to distribute the load, which, the company predicts, will lead to Parallel vehicles using just 25% of the energy compared to a semi-truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental reason we&#8217;re doing this is to accelerate the decarbonization of freight, but the problem that we see is rail&#8217;s scale of operations is limited to a market it can serve,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;So we&#8217;re trying to embrace this energy efficiency, but then break down its operational and economic barriers at the same time. And by the way, we&#8217;re making our powertrain electric, which further accelerates the decarbonization benefits because our grid itself is not clean. So when you look at a diesel truck, compared to what we&#8217;re building, and looking at the average, real-world CO<sub>2</sub>content of the U.S. grid, we&#8217;re going to be 90% less CO<sub>2</sub> per mile to move a unit of freight with our technology versus a diesel truck today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a>, a startup from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">AppDynamics founder</a> Jyoti Bansal, has been building a platform of developer tools over the last five years. In 2020, the company made its first foray into open source when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/harness-makes-first-acquisition-snagging-open-source-ci-company-drone-io/">continuous integration tool Drone</a>. Today, they embraced openness further with the release of a free and open version of the company&#8217;s continuous delivery product.</p>
<p>Bansal is reluctant to use the term &#8216;open source&#8217; because it carries some big connotations with it and he doesn&#8217;t want to misrepresent what the company is doing. But starting today, he is making the source code for the community edition of the continuous delivery tool available for any developer to use under the &#8220;source-accessible <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/">Polyform Shield</a> license.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything [in the same way] as what the power of open source would be, but we are using the source available licensing strategy, where we are putting 100 percent of our source in open repos…Everything is similar to a fully open source project except that our competitors are not allowed to monetize it,&#8221; Bansal explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the last several years, companies like Elastic and MongoDB saw some cloud providers like Amazon taking advantage of the open source license to create their own versions of the same product. They took exception and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/">created a slightly more restrictive license</a> to prevent wholesale poaching by competitors.</p>
<p>Stefano Maffulli executive director at the Open Source Initiative (OSI) says Harness is being careful and respectful when it comes to how they frame this product. &#8220;Harness is doing the right thing by making clear where they are using an OSI-approved license and where they are not. Doing so respects the community and builds trust,&#8221; Maffulli said.</p>

<p>Bansal said they are trying to balance the idea of having an open and available product, while protecting the significant investment they have made into building the product. He believes that by making it open, he can remove any friction from the process, allowing developers to download the open version without having to check with a manager or get permission, which is often the case when a purchase is involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have provided a free version of our product since the beginning, but we wanted to take it to the next level of where we just remove the barriers so there is no reason for a developer to ask for permission from their managers. They can go and download and try it and use it. And only when the product starts working in their environment and they&#8217;re successful will we have the commercial discussion if they need to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Harness also offers a paid enterprise version and a hosted version of the product in addition to the open product. Bansal says the plan is to eventually move every product on the platform where it makes sense into this model, but they are starting with the continuous delivery product since the Drone continuous integration product is already open source.</p>
<p>Bansal adds that the Drone founders really showed him the value of a community and how having outside developers involved in a project can improve the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;What [the Drone founders] brought to us was showing us that you could build a great community. We have been building great products, and we know how to build great products, but if we can involve our community of users much more closely and the developer community outside of the company, we can even build even better products.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s ad-fuelled boom in crypto trading looks to be headed for major speed restrictions: The country&#8217;s financial watchdog said it will beef up rules around marketing of crypto assets and could even put limits on who can invest, following government confirmation yesterday that it will extend the regulator&#8217;s remit to cover crypto.</p>
<p>In recent years, ads for crypto have been plastered over billboards across the UK capital &#8212; fuelling a boom in trading that has led to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">a few slaps </a>from the advertising standards watchdog.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">December</a>, the Advertising Standards Authority banned seven crypto ads for &#8220;irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers&#8217; inexperience and for failing to illustrate the risk of the investment&#8221; &#8212; saying it hoped to produce new guidance on crypto advertising.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the financial watchdog&#8217;s intervention looks set to put a more significant dampener on the UK crypto bubble.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/strengthen-financial-promotions-rules-protect-consumers">announcement</a> trailing the proposed changes, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it&#8217;s acting in response to concerns about the &#8220;ease and speed&#8221; that people can make high risk investments &#8212; in line with a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy">Consumer Investment Strategy</a> it published last year.</p>

<p>The plan for new crypto rules &#8212; which the FCA said will be confirmed by summer 2022 &#8212; include proposed restrictions on the marketing and uptake of cryptoassets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[T]he FCA plans to categorise qualifying cryptoassets as ‘Restricted Mass Market Investments’, meaning consumers would only be able to respond to cryptoasset financial promotions if they are classed as restricted, high net worth or sophisticated investors,&#8221; the regulator writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms issuing such promotions would have to adhere to FCA rules, such as the requirement to be clear, fair and not misleading,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The regulator is consulting on the proposals &#8212; with a deadline of March 23 for responses.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sarah Pritchard, the FCA&#8217;s executive director of markets, added: &#8220;Too many people are being led to invest in products they don’t understand and which are too risky for them. People need clear, fair information and proper risk warnings if they are to invest with confidence, which is the central aim of our consumer investments strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">government c</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">onfirmed</a> it will legislate to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation to tackle misleading advertising &#8212; writing (or, well, warning) that: &#8220;This means the promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to FCA rules in line with the same high standards that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products are held to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, chancellor, Rishi Sunak, added: &#8220;Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest &#8212; but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/research-note-cryptoasset-consumer-research-2021">Cryptoasset consumer research</a>, published by the FCA last summer, suggested that some 2.3 million Brits owned crypto (out of a UK population of ~52M) &#8212; which amounts to just under 4.5% of Brits holding crypto. In 2020 the FCA said that around 1.9M Brits held cryptoassets &#8212; suggesting there&#8217;s been a percentage increase of ~21% year over year, per the research.</p>
<p>Other estimates of the number of Brits holding crypto that have been bandied around by crypto press in recent months have <a href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/most-popular-cryptocurrency-2021-uk-093057693.html">touted even bigger figures</a> (but, well, the crypto trading press is itself often located inside the hype bubble).</p>
<p>The marketing frenzy around crypto trading in the UK certainly appears to have fuelled rising awareness among the population, with the FCA finding that 78% of adults had heard of cryptocurrencies &#8212; up from 42% in 2019; and 73% in 2020.</p>
<p>However in another finding that likely sharpened its concern, the regulator found that despite rising awareness the level of understanding of cryptocurrencies was declining &#8212; suggesting &#8220;some crypto users may not fully understand what they&#8217;re buying&#8221;, as it (politely) puts it. Ya think?!</p>
<p>The FCA research also found fewer crypto users regard buying the assets as a gamble (38%, down from 47%); and more see them as an alternative or complement to mainstream investments, with half of crypto users saying they intend to invest more&#8230;</p>
<p>Ergo, it&#8217;s not difficult to see why the UK government and financial regulator have decided it&#8217;s past time to step in with regulatory limits to stop clueless Brits from throwing money at Ponzi-like schemes wrapped in shiny crypto marketing.</p>
<p>Other countries are taking similar steps.</p>
<p>Just this week, Singapore&#8217;s financial regulator announced its own clamp down on crypto marketing (via <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Singapore-clamps-down-on-ads-for-highly-risky-crypto-trading">Nikkei Asia</a>).</p>
<p>Some other countries are going even further &#8212; with planned cryptocurrency bans in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">China</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">India</a>.</p>
<p>The free-for-all trading party isn&#8217;t over yet but regulators around the globe are slowly closing in on cryptoland&#8217;s gangsta paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big banks are under a lot of pressure to modernize their services to meet demands of consumers who now view things like mobile apps that identify who and where you are; or instant, on-demand products, as table stakes &#8212; consumers that are in turn increasingly looking at neobanks to give them a better level of service when it comes to their money and managing it. Today a startup that is building tools to help incumbent address this challenge is announcing a round of funding on the back of a lot of demand for its services.</p>
<p><a href="https://personetics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personetics</a>, which has built AI-based technology for banks to personalize their offerings &#8212; for example understanding a users&#8217; spending habits, and combining that with larger datasets, to offer advice for savings, based on a customer&#8217;s spending patterns &#8212; has raised $85 million, funding that will go towards expanding the tools that Personetics provides to banking customers, as well as to expand its base of users.</p>
<p>That base is already pretty impressive. It currently has 80 banking customers, a list that spans some of the world&#8217;s biggest names in financial services. (Names that it can disclose include <span class="s3">Metro Bank, Santander, U.S. Bank, Huntington Bank, UOB, Hyundai Card, and MUFG.) Altogether Personetics&#8217; technology interacts with some 120 million users across 30 countries. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It has also been on a fundraising run, with this round adding up to $160 million raised since the start of 2021. This latest round is being led by Thoma Bravo with Viola Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Nyca Partners and Warburg Pincus &#8212; all previous investors in the company &#8212; also participating. It&#8217;s not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Although we hear a lot of talk these days about digital transformation being synonymous with migrating to the cloud, Personetics typifies a persistent trend in the world of enterprise that runs contrary to that. David Sosna, its CEO and co-founder, said that although the company offers a SaaS version of its personalization tech, &#8220;many&#8221; of its customers &#8212; including some of the names that have made a big point of trying to modernise, such as Santander &#8212; are actually using Personetics on-premises.</p>
<p class="p9">&#8220;Sending financial data out is something banks are doing, but it’s not 100%,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see them moving there, but I don’t see them rushing there. Financial data is probably the last thing that you will see migrate to the cloud.&#8221; More commonly, they may build new services in the cloud, which they will then run in tandem with legacy services, which are not. Even in those cases, he added, &#8220;we are part of that infrastructure on services like Azure, or Google Cloud or AWS, but they own it &#8212; not us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the mechanics of how the services get implemented, the more salient fact is that they <em>are </em>being implemented full-stop. They are moving to personalisation for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the rise of challenger banks lighting a fire under them and getting them moving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hey are seeing the impact of the alternatives,&#8221; he said, with the migration away from the incumbents happening gradually. &#8220;25% of your customers may be adopting external lending providers or BNPL. That&#8217;s a common thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Secondly is the fact that this is simply what consumers are demanding now, the &#8220;table stakes&#8221; in this territory, as Sosna puts it. &#8220;They really have no choice.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p9">Third of all has been the impact of Covid-19 and wider market forces. With more banks closing down physical branches, they have become more &#8212; and in some cases, completely &#8212; reliant on digital platforms to run and grow their businesses. This too is leading them to build and run better sites and apps to get this done.</p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s not a big leap between financial services and fintech &#8212; indeed, in cities like London which have strong industries in tech and financial services, the two have long competed heavily to recruit technical talent &#8212; it&#8217;s surprising that we haven&#8217;t seen more banks trying to built personalization in house rather than look to a third-party provider like Personetics.</p>
<p class="p9">Sosna said that some have indeed tried this. &#8220;The big ones are trying and have built certain capabilities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The big ones believe they need to own it.&#8221; However, much of this has been slow to take off, and so in many cases working with a third party has been an easier way for them to experiment. &#8220;That’s the case and I don’t think it will change,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In the midst of a fintech revolution that has seen a huge wave of challenger banks emerge, and an equally impressive group of banking infrastructure startups surface to provide API-based, embedded services to neobanks to build their products, there has been a smaller set of companies that have seized an opportunity to address the needs of incumbents to compete against these newer players. Others in the same category include 10x, which was founded by ex-incumbent banking executives and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised significant funding</a> to build tools specifically for the behemoths.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if Personetics over time works with more neobanks, alongside the incumbents. After all, neobanks have gone all-in on embedded services, so it would make sense for them to look to third parties potentially to improve personalization, too.</p>
<p>Personetics does have some digital banks as customers, Sosna said, although most of these have grown out of the bigger incumbents. &#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e like that segment because they have more muscle to start with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span>A lot of these fintechs start and stop and go right and left. It&#8217;s hard for us to understand their strategy, so once they get to a certain size it might make more sense to partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the line, the company is likely to bring on more services to underpin the personalization it already offers, such as in more specific areas like lending, where it might, for example, give banks the ability to evaluate loan applications faster and using a wider set of data comparable to what new-wave fintechs are providing. It&#8217;s already doing a lot of automated work in moving money around so lending is a natural step.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When it comes to savings and lending and investing one of the things we like is to provide an automated capability to move money on your behalf,&#8221; he said. This might happen, for example, between a current account and moving surplus money every month into a higher-interest account to accrue better returns. &#8220;We have multiple banks using that now, where you opt in and then automatically moves the money without asking your permission every time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>“As the range and complexity of financial products continues to grow, Personetics simplifies and personalizes banking for consumers with its industry-leading AI technology,&#8221; said Robert Sayle, a partner at Thoma Bravo, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to partner with Personetics and leverage our operational expertise in software and financial technology to help accelerate the company’s momentum, the introduction of new products and technology, and the platform‘s reach to financial institutions and their customers across the globe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://revolut.com">Revolut</a> is rolling out stock trading in its app in the U.S. The company already lets you buy and sell shares if you’re a British user. And now, Revolut has received approval to become a licensed U.S. broker-dealer in the U.S.</p>
<p>Revolut users will be able to trade 1,100 securities, such as shares on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The company will also offer access to 200 ETFs. When it comes to features, Revolut offers fractional shares and several order types, such as limit and stop-limit orders.</p>
<p>In the app, you’ll find market graphs, a selection of news headlines and information about the top ten holdings of each ETF. Users can set up price alerts as well. When you buy and sell an asset, you don’t pay any commission. Like on all trading platforms, there’s some spread between the buy and sell price though.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With this new feature, Revolut competes more directly with <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://cash.app">Cash App</a>. Over the past few years, Revolut has positioned itself as a financial super app.</p>
<p>In the U.S., users can use it as an alternative to a traditional checking account. You can order a debit card, create a virtual card, send and receive money, and put some money aside in a savings vault.</p>
<p>More recently, Revolut has started to expand beyond payments. In the U.S., it has partnered with Paxos to launch the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/revolut-partners-with-paxos-to-bring-cryptocurrency-trading-to-the-us/">trade cryptocurrencies</a> in the app. And now, there&#8217;s stock trading.</p>
<p>Of course, Revolut users in the U.K. still have access to more features. But it’s interesting to see that Revolut is still releasing new features in the U.S. in order to build a financial super app that works across multiple markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many consumer fintech companies that started in Europe have ditched plans to enter the U.S. For instance, <a href="https://n26.com/en-us">N26</a> recently announced that it’ll stop its operations in the U.S. Revolut currently has 18 million customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ancient8.gg/">Ancient8</a>, Vietnam&#8217;s blockchain gaming guild, develops a community and software platform to enable everyone to play P2E (play-to-earn) games and build the metaverse while earning rewards.</p>
<p>“We lend our P2E game assets to the scholars, or guild players, so they can play P2E games and enable them to earn rewards. Vietnam has a monthly average income of $250, which is not particularly privileged compared to <a href="https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php#:~:text=The%20average%20gross%20annual%20wage,than%20in%20the%20previous%20year).">approximately $5,800 for the United States</a> and about $1,000 for the Philippines. We are demonstrable able to improve the financial income and life of our scholars by offering them this opportunity,” co-founder of Ancient8 Howard Xu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ancient8 partners with P2E games to produce educational content for local communities in Vietnam and educate people about both blockchain and P2E games, Xu said. It helps more than 10,000 blockchain game players by providing scholarship and educational opportunities, community, blockchain and software products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Vietnam is the third-largest country in Southeast Asia with a population of 100 million and skews young in demographics, making the country a ripe market for mainstream adoption of GameFi, Xu added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnering with our community of gaming enthusiasts and game developers, we are democratizing social and financial access for the first native generation of Metaverse citizens,&#8221; said Xu. &#8220;Innovative play-to-earn games such as Axie Infinity have changed the status quo, empowering gamers to own a piece of the games that they play and share social and financial rewards by contributing to the community, all while having fun. We are excited to build the infrastructure layer for the future of blockchain gaming and the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ancient8 was founded in July 2021 by Xu, Nathan L and William Phan with a mission to reach, educate and empower the next 100 million metaverse citizens.</p>
<p>Xu also said Nathan and William are pioneers in Vietnam’s crypto ecosystem, educating Vietnamese users from their time at <a href="https://twitter.com/coin68">Coin68</a> and <a href="https://kyros.ventures/">Kyros Ventures</a>, a Vietnamese blockchain media outlet and incubator, in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ancient8 announced today it has raised a $4 million seed financing led by <a href="https://www.dcp.capital/">Dragonfly Capital</a>, <a href="https://panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.hashed.com/">Hashed</a>. Strategic investors including Mechanism Capital, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ventures">Coinbase Ventures</a>, Alameda Research, 3Tweleve Capital, Alameda Research, <a href="https://guildfi.com/">GuildFi</a>, 3Twelve Capital, Coin98 Ventures, Kyros Ventures, Raydium, Jump Capital and <a href="https://sipher.xyz/">Sipher</a> also participated in the round along with previous backers Trung Nguyen (Axie Infinity), Santiago R Santos, Nick Chong and Loi Luu (Kyber Network).</p>
<p>Ancient8 plans to use the latest funding to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for all community members to easily learn about developments in GameFi and build more GameFi tools. The proceeds also will be used to develop more blockchain and software products to serve as the infrastructure layer for the metaverse. As more blockchain games come out, Ancient8 will continue to increase its game coverage, the company said.</p>
<p>“[Gaming] guilds represent an important building block in the GameFi ecosystem, offering users a powerful community to adopt new technologies and earn rewards for gameplay,” said Mia Deng, partner at Dragonfly Capital.</p>
<p>Global crypto venture capitals are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/21/crypto-vcs-are-making-a-big-bet-on-gaming-guilds-why/">flocking to the gaming guilds</a>. Andreessen Horowitz invested in the Philippine-based crypto gaming guild <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yield-guild-games">YieldGuildGames </a>last year.  In November, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guildfi">GulidFi, </a>a Thailand-based gaming guild, secured $6 million from crypto venture capital firms, including Defiance Capital, Pantera Capital, and Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>“Vietnam is one of the most exciting and fast-growing markets in the world today for blockchain adoption. Local communities are realizing the potential impact of this emerging financial system and, in particular, the opportunities in play-to-earn gaming. Ancient8 has built an incredible gateway for the play-to-earn ecosystem as Vietnam’s largest blockchain gaming build and we’re excited to partner with them,” said partners at Pantera Capital Paul Veradittakit.</p>
<p>“We believe that blockchain is the opportunity for Vietnam and Southeast Asia to shine and demonstrate explosive growth. We have already seen a huge warm welcome from the Vietnamese community for blockchain technology,” Xu said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first electric bus by Swedish-Kenyan EV startup, <a href="https://www.opibus.se/">Opibus</a>, has hit Kenya&#8217;s roads marking the beginning of the company’s venture into the mass transit industry. Opibus first announced plans to roll out electric public transport buses last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">when it raised $7.5 million in a pre-Series A round</a>.</p>
<p>The startup is now running a pilot in readiness for the commercial launch of EV buses in Kenya later this year, and across Africa by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Opibus has over the last five years been in the business of future-proofing existing gasoline and diesel vehicles by converting them to electric. EVs come with a range of benefits including a reduced cost of transport and no carbon emissions. The startup, which was founded in 2017 by Gardler, Filip Lövström and Mikael Gånge, has so far converted over 170 vehicles for different clients including mining companies and tour firms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is now slowly pivoting to the building of EVs and supportive infrastructure like public charging stations. Brand new Opibus electric buses will cost $100,000 and $60,000 for conversions (which the startup is using in the pilot program).</p>
<p>“This first year, we will be testing 10 buses commercially in Nairobi to ensure that the product fits and is optimized for the usage patterns. Once we get this valuable feedback, we will make the required changes and get all our production partners lined up to scale the roll out as rapidly as possible,” Opibus chief strategy and marketing officer, Albin Wilson, told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Opibus says its vehicles are designed and built locally, giving them a competitive advantage in terms of a lower price by the time they reach the market. Additionally, local production means that the output can be tailored for local market needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our strategy is to design and develop a bus that is viable in price, durable and accessible for this region…We are building a product that allows for a rapid scale up, that can leverage global and local manufacturers. Meaning our design is easily implemented across the African continent, as it is a product tailored for the use case, and very cost effective,” said Wilson.</p>
<p>The startup is now eyeing the rest of Africa through partnerships that will drive the adoption of EVs across the continent..</p>
<p>Uber’s partnership with Opibus, which was announced last month, for example, will see the deployment of up to 3,000 electric motorcycles, manufactured by the startup, across Africa by 2022. Motorcycles under Uber are used as taxis and for deliveries in its different markets.</p>
<p>The EV sector in Kenya is budding and has over the recent years attracted new players including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-startup-basigo-debuts-in-nairobi-after-1-million-pre-seed-funding/">BasiGo, which made its debut in Kenya in November last year</a>. BasiGO, which recently imported two EV mass transport buses for its pilot, plans to sell locally-assembled electric buses using parts from China’s EV maker BYD Automotive. The BasiGo buses come in 25 and 36-seater capacities, with a range of about 250 kilometers while those by Opibus come in 51-seater capacity with a range of 120 kilometers.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multinationals like Amazon and Alibaba have leveraged logistics infrastructure such as UPS and FedEx to create large businesses. It’s not the same in Africa, where few third-party infrastructure players exist to provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end-to-end logistics to e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paps.sn/">PAPS</a>, a Senegal-based logistics and delivery company, is filling this gap in its region by offering customers various logistics services. Today the company is announcing that it has raised a $4.5 million pre-Series A round to expand its tech-enabled logistics solution across the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">4DX Ventures</a> and regional telecom operator Orange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Participating investors include existing funds Uma Ventures and Saviu Ventures and new investors Yamaha Motor, LoftyInc Capital, Proparco, To.org, Kepple Ventures and Enza Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sn.linkedin.com/in/bamba-l%C3%B4-%E8%92%82%E5%B8%83%E5%85%B0-54972031">Bamba Lo</a> founded PAPS in 2016 to provide end-to-end logistics solutions for businesses with offline and online operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PAPS operated a consumer-to-consumer logistics model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it immediately pivoted after noticing how infrequent and disorganized most requests were. It was hard to precisely predict</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the delivery flows in the space, which is different from the B2B model, where deliveries are planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform caters to small to large businesses, assisting them with their logistics needs, from storage and international transport to last-mile delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS also provides merchants with visibility features to track and know the status of deliveries from takeoff to the point of destination. Merchants can also schedule deliveries on the platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we launched PAPS, the first thing we wanted to give to our clients was visibility on their transactions, they had to know when the driver has picked their goods up, where the goods are during transit, and when it arrives,” Lo, the chief executive, told TechCrunch on a call. “So that’s what we are trying to do to build &#8212; an infrastructure that can serve all B2B clients from warehousing and dispatching to the last-mile delivery.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259316" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259316" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2259316" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?w=680" alt="PAPS" width="680" height="429" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg 5241w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=680,429 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=1536,969 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=2048,1293 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/07F20B70-D714-4D24-8B88-B755263DE6B3.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259316" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PAPS</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senegalese company owns the warehouses used to store clients’ goods and parcels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also owns motorcycles, vans, cars and trucks to carry out inter- and intra-city logistics and deliveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, the logistics company has a relay network of hubs close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its clients that act as delivery points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief executive said that PAPS wants to create that infrastructure and an enabler for those businesses to access clients they cannot reach today because of logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gap that we are filling is one that all these big corporations didn’t want it to address, which is the domestic market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one addressed the domestic market except PAPS and that’s why we want to give quality and reliability,” he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS clients span a range of industries, such as banking, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals (Lo said that the company currently handles distribution for 70% of all pharmacies in Senegal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major logistics players such as DHL and FedEx and consumer and business-focused e-commerce brands like Jumia, Glovo and Sokowatch also use PAPS for their operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, PAPS claims to be the largest last-mile fleet in Senegal, making over 10 million deliveries across its two markets since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And according to Lo, the company’s delivery numbers are growing 150% year-on-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use this pre-Series A round to strengthen its tech team, build out physical infrastructure to onboard more warehouses, hubs and fleets and extend its offering to more African companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures, said in a statement, “We have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Paps team’s execution thus far and their dedication to creating a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovative business in the logistics space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology has a critical role to play in modernizing Africa’s logistics infrastructure and we look forward to further partnering with Bamba and the paps team on this next phase of their growth”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice</a>, a platform that helps with workforce people management &#8212; the ability to carry out performance reviews, employee feedback, and praise; tools to set and track goals and other long-term career plans; and analytics to get a bigger picture of how a workforce is working &#8212; has really come into its own as a business in the last two years, as our concepts of &#8220;office&#8221; and &#8220;team&#8221; have been stretched by the challenges of a global health pandemic. Now, the eponymous startup has closed a big funding round at a big valuation &#8212; $175 million, a Series F that values Lattice at $3 billion &#8212; underscoring the ground it has gained in the market, and the ambitions it has for the future.</p>
<p>Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, Tiger Global, and Dragoneer led the round, with previous backers Founders Fund, HighSage Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Fuel Capital, Khosla Ventures, and several new, unnamed angel investors, also participating. The funding brings the total raised by Lattice to $330 million, and it&#8217;s coming just 10 months after the company last raised (a Series E at a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lattice-raises-60m-in-series-e-funding-round-at-1-billion-valuation-301253586.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>). Jack Altman, the founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that Lattice was proactively approached this time around on the back of strong growth.</p>
<p>The company today focuses on desk-based, so-called &#8220;information&#8221; or &#8220;knowledge&#8221; workers. It now has 3,550 businesses as customers, up by more than 1,000 since that last round in March 2021. Lattice&#8217;s customer base is heavy on tech companies that are resident in its own backyard. These make up about half of its users today and the list includes the likes of Slack, Turo, Clio and more. Front-line, deskless employees are not currently part of Lattice&#8217;s remit &#8212; they require a significantly different set of tools and, often, priorities from those sitting at computers all day, but Altman didn&#8217;t rule out that this would be a segment it would like to tackle in the months and years ahead.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lattice&#8217;s traction in the market is partly due to the fact that its tools match up well with today&#8217;s work climate.</p>
<p>The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years. Thanks to Covid-19, many people who had traditionally gone into offices are now working at home or other smaller, more localized environments. What hasn&#8217;t changed, though, is that this workforce still needs to operate as a cohesive team, where people can communicate about what they are achieving, and what they want to do, and managers can get a picture of what they&#8217;re doing to reward them or identify ways to work better.</p>
<p>Lattice had been growing at a steady pace for several years before Covid-19 descended, but it was the pandemic that really put a spotlight on how important people management could be when it is effective (and being effective means having tools that people are actually willing to use, since there are so many out there now that feel more like chores to get through than helpful aides).</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d built many products and got a lot of traction [before the pandemic] but the world we’re living in today has accelerated things for a lot of reasons,&#8221; Altman said in an interview. &#8220;The office environment allows for a lot of interpersonal exchanges, connection, and apprenticeship. It’s not that you don’t need software for people management in the office environment but when you don’t have those connections you still need to feel like you work for a bigger purpose. We are staring at a box all day now, and we don’t have a manger who comes by and says great job and makes us feel appreciated. Systems like Lattice give a process for how we connect and interact and make sure that I know that I am cared for by our manager as a professional and a person. Covid-10 created that tailwind.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another helpful, if surprising, factor has been the economy. Many presumed in the spring of 2020 that everything would tank with a drop in demand, collapsing supply chains, and a veil of uncertainty that would inhibit growth. Some sectors did indeed struggle &#8212; travel and tourism for example really did grind to a halt initially &#8212; but the whole economy did not collapse, unemployment stabilized, and some people even started to realize that they had some bargaining power due to hiring demands. This in turn led to a bigger drive for better people management tools, Altman said.</p>
<p>He characterized the thinking as: &#8220;&#8216;Geez, we&#8217;ve got to invest in people more if we want to keep them.&#8217; That became the economic backdrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>People management as a wider part of enterprise IT has seen a lot of evolution in the last several years. Companies like Workday that dominate HR software have created ever-wider toolsets within their platforms to manage aspects of performance and compensation; alongside that, a number of pure-play companies like 15Five have emerged to focus specifically on areas like goals and praise. Lattice both partners with larger platforms and also competes against them. I suspect that the latter will become a more dominant part of those relationships as Lattice continues to add more functionality to its own platform. In the last several years, for example, it has added performance management, and then engagement surveys, and now a host of career development tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The longer term plan is to keep building and expanding,&#8221; Altman said. Within that, the company might push into more traditional HR tools, although whatever it brings into the mix &#8212; which could also include more AI-based automation, but only, he added, when it becomes something useful to helping people be more mindful about work performance &#8212; Altman believes that Lattice will always stand in contrast to these simply because it&#8217;s always been conceived of with the individual employee, not the HR team, at the center of the wheel.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The world of work has changed, and the dimension we&#8217;re in is moving from companies to employees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The result of that swing is that companies need to update from being company-centric to employee-centric. We are based on that thesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The widening of the platform and the functionality within it, serving a fast-growing and slow-churing base of customers, holds a lot of promise for investors.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a few broad trends come together in recent years — the rise of remote work, the evolution of the role of HR — that have fuelled the HR market,” said investor Elad Gil, in a statement. “Lattice&#8217;s approach of creating a broad suite of interconnected offerings has resonated and led to really exciting growth.”</p>

<p>In a move rarely made by Western venture capitalists, QED Investors announced today that it has hired an African partner, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gbengaajayi">Gbenga Ajayi</a>. He will focus on Africa investments as part of QED’s international team.</p>
<p>Last September, the fintech-focused venture capital firm announced closing $1.05 billion for its oversubscribed seventh fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">reported</a> that Fund VII, made up of a $550 million early-stage fund and a $500 million growth-stage fund, will be used to back “fintech companies primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Latin America and Southeast Asia.” Today’s announcement adds Africa to the mix.</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch, QED co-founder and managing partner <a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/team/nigel-morris">Nigel Morris</a> said that adding Africa is the final jigsaw puzzle that makes QED Investors a fully global fintech-specialist firm.</p>
<p>Preparations for QED to get into Africa started some 18 months ago when the firm began seeing a lot of inbounds and pitches from the region. This period &#8212; particularly throughout 2021, during which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/african-tech-took-center-stage-in-2021/">five unicorns were minted &#8212;</a> saw an explosion in venture capital like never before as seasoned founders emerged with willing local and international VCs to back them.</p>
<p>With so much demand for capital on a continent with more than a billion people but low financial inclusivity, adding Africa as QED’s next frontier was a no-brainer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We do fintech. It’s all we do; it’s what we know. And we are subject-matter deep, and hopefully, potentially experts, in the space,” Morris said. “Gbenga and I talked at length on how the traditional banks try to engage through an analog distribution system of branches when its population is a mobile-native generation that desires to be able to engage via mobile.</p>
<p>“So, as we saw investable opportunities starting to come to us and as we started to be avalanched by inbound from Africa, it became really clear that there was enormous amounts of demand in those markets like what we had seen across other geographies, particularly in other developing countries.”</p>
<p>The fintech-focused firm isn’t the only investor to notice these opportunities. Other global investors have as well, but most of their multiple investments have been led by partners without local market know-how.</p>
<p>But QED decided not to take this approach. By hiring an African partner to lead its charge, the firm may be setting an example of how foreign VCs will operate on the continent in the future.</p>
<p>Before QED Investors, Ajayi worked in different roles across Africa and global fintech/tech. He worked at Google as product partnerships lead in Europe and Africa before transitioning to other positions within the company, including managing telecom industry partnerships and leading parts of the internet giant’s mobile app business in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The partner was also a product director for SMB growth at Wise, a global cross-border remittance fintech. He also worked as head of strategic partnerships at Europe’s biggest neobank, Revolut.</p>
<p>Away from operational roles, Ajayi is also the co-founder of Kanza Ventures, a boutique seed investment and advisory firm focused on fintech in Africa.</p>
<p>As an investor and operator with experience working in different regions across Africa, Ajayi brings much-needed experience, especially in a region where fintechs seemingly face more troubling regulatory and compliance hurdles than their counterparts globally.</p>
<p>“Being able to be part of the fintech and tech boom that we have today and helping large tech companies that have now become household names take off means that I’ve had the opportunity and the privilege to sit at the very forefront,” Ajayi said.</p>
<p>“And so combining that and my fintech experience, and the fact that I’ve worked with a bunch of companies, I think it’s like a collective coming together to join QED.”</p>
<p>Ajayi is the first of two African investor professionals hired this past month by QED. The firm also brought on <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chidinma-iwueke-b1b8491a">Chidinma “Chid” Iwueke</a> as a principal.</p>
<p>Iwueke, who was previously an equity research associate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a partner at Nigeria-based early-stage venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a>, will focus on domestic and international investments for the firm.</p>
<p>“We started off to find one wonderful person, and we found two. And I think that speaks louder than bombs about how much talent there is in Africa,” Morris said.</p>
<p>As a global firm, QED has hubs in Washington, D.C., New York and London. On the call, Morris said Ajayi would be based out of London and Iwueke in New York.</p>
<p>Both hires are based off the continent to connect founders and startups to valuable resources such as making hires and getting customers outside of Africa. Yet, they will spend lots of time on the ground, as a large part of their job will be forming partnerships and sourcing deals with local VCs, accelerators and founders across Africa, said Ajayi.</p>

<p>QED expects its upcoming portfolio companies to take advantage of its specialization in fintech, operational expertise and willingness to roll up its sleeves to build and scale financial products Africa’s mass-market needs.</p>
<p>But despite the seeming commitment, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">QED doesn’t have a dedicated amount of capital or range of ticket sizes to deploy in the continent’s startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">In an interview last September</a>, the firm mentioned that it plans to invest between $5 million and $15 million in 40 to 50 companies via its early-stage fund and $10 million to $40 million in 20 to 25 startups in its growth fund).</span></p>
<p>Thus, no one knows what to expect of QED’s deal-making process yet. Morris opines that people shouldn’t read that to mean a lack of activity and non-commitment. “We will build something special here. But we’ll do it in a very balanced and thoughtful businesslike way,” he said.</p>
<p>One thing is sure, though: Just as it is with its global strategy, QED, which has invested in 23 unicorns with over $4.6 billion AUM, will back African companies across the entire spectrum of investing, from pre-seed stage to IPO.</p>
<p>The company has made 170 investments globally. It’s yet to make its first in Africa, but hiring two investment professionals on the continent &#8212; a partner and principal &#8212; is a welcome start for the continent’s tech ecosystem.</p>
