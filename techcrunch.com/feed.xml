										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toronto-based <a href="https://clear.co/">Clearco</a>, a fintech capital provider for online companies, has raised $215 million in a round led by SoftBank Vision Fund II. The financing event closed just weeks after Clearco completed its most recent financing, a $100 million round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">that quintupled its valuation to $2 billion.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tIwWsGu57k"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">Clearbanc rebrands its way into a unicorn</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearbanc rebrands its way into a unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/embed/#?secret=tIwWsGu57k" data-secret="tIwWsGu57k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the trend of rapid-fire, follow-on financing for startups is well-known these days, SoftBank’s involvement is notable for a meta reason: a Japanese Conglomerate that was once known for flashy nine-figure VC checks is putting millions of dollars into a company built on somewhat the opposite ethos: alternative financing that allows founders to avoid venture capital altogether.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/MicheleRomanow">Michele Romanow</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewdsouza?lang=en">Andrew D’Souza</a> admit that the two companies are on opposite sides of the spectrum, they also think the existing between the two entities led to a closed deal.</p>
<p>“Their business was to rethink the way venture capital is done,” D’Souza said. “They saw what we were doing on the other end of the spectrum, which was to use technology to thousands of entrepreneurs, and that’s really what resonated.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, Clearco, formerly Clearbanc, launched “the 20-minute term sheet”, a platform that allowed e-commerce companies to raise non-dilutive marketing growth capital between $10,000 to $10 million based on its revenue and ad spend. The founders then flexed rapid capital deployment based on data — and, to date, Clearco has put more than $2.5 billion in over 5,500 companies.</p>
<p>In the past few year, Cleaco’s messaging has changed. Per D’Souza, fast, affordable and “unbiased” capital is still a big reason why people come to the company, but they are now focused on the “technical challenge on how to provide personalized advice and the support you get from an engaged investor, board member, advisor, but at the scale of thousands and millions.” The product map has followed this energy. In the last year, Clearco launched ClearRunway to help SaaS founders secure non-dilutive capital repaid through revenue-share agreements, a valuation tool, inventory buybacks, and ClearAngel, an alternative financing platform for founders with minimal revenue.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s money will be used to help Clearco grow to new geographies beyond Europe, Canada and the United States. Part of its international strategy will include M&amp;A, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/brazils-divibank-raises-millions-to-become-the-clearbanc-of-latam/">copycats emerge</a> in emerging markets. While Clearco has grown from the anti-VC tool to a founder and capital services platform, its opinionated international energy may be what makes it a good deal for SoftBank.</p>
<p>“We believe that we can back a million founders around the world if we can take this alternative financing model in every country,” Romanow said. “Masa has a different model, which was to put $100 million dollar in 100 companies,” she added, referring to Masayoshi Son, the billionaire at the helm of SoftBank. She noted how Son didn’t speak for the first eight minutes of Clearco’s pitch (which ultimately was the result of him paying attention, not questioning Clearco’s utility).</p>
<p>Despite SoftBank&#8217;s previously garish personality, the group&#8217;s investment strategy may be changing. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/SoftBank2/SoftBank-Vision-Fund-2-cranks-up-investment-to-one-company-per-day">Per Nikkei Asia</a>, SoftBank Vision Fund II has an average check size of $152 million, far lower than Vision Fund I&#8217;s average check size of $931 million. Still, the publication reports that the conglomerate has begun cranking up its investment cadence to one new deal a day.</p>
<p>With the Clearco investment, its clear that it thinks that rewriting venture capital will include adding optionality to it, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated one billion people worldwide face the challenge of proving who they are, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to a <a href="http://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">World Bank Group report</a> which states that 81% of this number live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia without official proof of identity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no news that Africans spend an inordinate amount of time trying to prove or verify their identities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gain access to address proofs, financial accounts, loans, SIM cards, and social services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per reports, an estimated 500 million Africans have no formal identification at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a dearth of services tackling this challenge but the few that exist are employing artificial intelligence for more dependable processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.smileidentity.com/about.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smile Identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of such. The company provides ID verification and KYC compliance for African faces and identities. Today, the company is announcing that it has closed a $7 million Series A funding.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costanoa Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led the investment with pan-African venture firm</span><a href="https://cre.vc/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CRE Venture Capital.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other investors that participated include VCs like</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LocalGlobe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Intercept Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and unnamed angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Khosla Impact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ValueStream Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beta Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">500 Startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Story Ventures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Straub founded Smile Identity with William Bares in 2017. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an investor, Straub took regular trips between Mumbai and Nairobi, spending up to a decade in the former</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 2000s, it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frustrating to get SIM cards or provide identity checks in India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But things began to change in 2009 when the <a href="https://www.indiastack.org/">India Stack</a> was set in motion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stack is a unified software platform via APIs that provide governments, businesses, startups, and developers with seamless identification, verification and authentication processes across multiple industries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do things like KYC to sign a document </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to share or federate documents across a company or school, to prove a birth certificate, or to prove an educational credential,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unleashed this wave of innovation, entrepreneurship activity and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changed financial services and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> share economy services in India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While India </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advanced with this effort, Africa has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played catch up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most businesses on the continent still find it daunting to onboard new customers, salespeople or employees without spending lots of time and energy on people, processes and paperwork</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d seen for 10 or 15 years how long Indians had been waiting and how many problems this set of new national ID combined with these different software protocols solved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I saw how much friction the Stack removed from people&#8217;s lives. And I thought if only there was an Africa stack.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straub said he began brainstorming with some entrepreneurs in Nairobi and figured that if an African Stack was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, three factors needed to come into play &#8212; cost, government independence, and spot-on technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also happened that at that time, open-source face recognition algorithms on a wide range of smartphones had flooded the market and advanced the state of verification </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging camera technology, Straub and his partners started Smile Identity and developed de-biased face recognition that was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more accurate for Africans than the base level open-source algorithms published in U.S. colleges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to combine that over time by matching selfies against either identity documents or photos on file at ID issuing authorities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the combination of those two technologies &#8212; the face recognition and all the liveness checks and, and anti-fraud checks that go with it, combined with verifying for the source of truth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years on, Smile Identity is now present across six markets in Africa: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It covers more than 250 million identities and verification for 15 different ID types while performing over one million identity checks every month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in banking, fintech, ride-sharing, worker verification, public social welfare programs, and telecommunications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smile Identity says it has about 80 customers who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a per-query basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some include payments companies like Paystack, Paga, and Chipper Cash; neo-banks like Kuda and Umba; traditional banks like Stanbic IBTC; cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Luno, and Paxful; and supply-chain businesses like Twiga</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding product-market fit took a while for Smile Identity at first. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was little or no playbook to follow, so the company had to figure out the right mixture of features and pricing favourable for African markets, smartphones and the internet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had to build SDKs and mobile wrappers that work for Android and iOS but also things like React Native and Flutter and make them work on mobile web browsers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every one of these solutions we came up with was because we hit some friction point with customers that forced us to innovate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of those were either device issues that we ran into or low internet connection or low or no internet connection conditions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with continuous iteration and working with different clients, Smile Identity is on track for another level of growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past couple of months, there have been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talks on fintechs and regulatory requirements ranging from local data protection laws and consent requirements to privacy policies and data impact assessments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These requirements are hard to keep up with, and Straub says Smile Identity is working on templates its clients can use to navigate them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;ve been building into our products and our services, some of these compliance measures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s ongoing work, of course, as more and more of these requirements </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are put</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straub believes that in many ways, Smile Identity is at an index of the growth of African fintech because of its bilateral usage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, Smile Identity help fintechs spot good and potential bad users who might hurt their businesses in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are an accelerant of the growth of fintechs and shared economy companies because they know when they spend money on customers, those are real customers because they have actually done verification with us,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Smile Identity secured a $4 million seed round. With this Series A, the company has raised a total of $11 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smile Identity plans to use the new investment to improve its services, expand across more markets, add support for more ID types and hire more engineers and support staff across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That said,</span><a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/team/investors/john-cowgill/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Cowgill</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a partner at Costanoa, will be joining Smile Identity’s board.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">High-profile investors are doubling down on their bets to explore the future of social commerce in India. DealShare said on Thursday it has raised $144 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence in the South Asian market and eye opportunities in international markets.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series D, was led by Tiger Global and valued the Indian startup at $455 million (post-money), up from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dealshare-raises-21-million-to-expand-its-e-commerce-platform-to-100-indian-cities-and-towns/">pre-money valuation of $50 million in Series C</a>. TechCrunch reported in April that the New York-based hedge fund was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/tiger-global-leads-100-million-investment-in-indian-social-commerce-dealshare/">talks to lead a large round in the Bangalore-headquartered startup</a>.</p>
<p>WestBridge Capital, Alpha Wave Incubation (a venture fund backed by ADQ, and managed by Falcon Edge Capital), Z3Partners, Partners of DST Global, and Alteria Capital also participated in the new round, third in the last seven months and which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $183 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as Amazon and Flipkart have been able to create a sizeable market in the urban Indian cities, much of the nation remains still underserved. (Fun fact: DealShare kickstarted its journey the day Walmart acquired Flipkart.)</p>
<p>DealShare, which began as an e-commerce platform on WhatsApp, where it offered hundreds of products to consumers, is attempting to reach consumers in smaller Indian cities and towns. The startup says customers on its platform buy curated items in groups, which makes purchases “highly competitive” in affordability. The average cart size on DealShare is between $16 to $19, the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">SoftBank and Prosus Ventures-backed Meesho</a>, offers “high quality, low priced essentials coupled with a gamified, fun and virality-driven vernacular shopping experience that makes it easy for first-time internet users to experience online shopping,” its executives said.</p>
<p>The community purchasing, they said, enables “ultra-low-cost delivery mechanism” and ensures “best-in-class unit economics.” DealShare has amassed over 1000+ micro-entrepreneurs partners who help it promote the community group buying model in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to strengthen our network further and increase it to 5000+ by this year-end. Along with this, we are planning to fuel the growth by building State-of-the-art technology and infrastructure-related assets which will ensure efficiency,” said Sankar Bora, Founder, Chief Operation Officer, DealShare.</p>

<p>“We are excited to partner with DealShare as they grow the Indian E-commerce market. DealShare’s unique approach combines discovery-led social sharing, group buying, and a gamified shopping experience with a simple consumer interface. They are well positioned to power the next wave of Indian ecommerce growth,” said Griffin Schroeder, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>DealShare expects to break-even in the next 12 months and will also expand to international markets, said Navroz Udwadia, co-founder and chief executive of Falcon Edge Capital. The expansion will start with the UAE, he added.</p>
<p>Social commerce, which combines commerce with social media, is in its infancy in India but has potential to become mainstream, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forays by Reliance and Tata Group are already causing tremors in the e-commerce ecosystem and social commerce has potential to further proliferate. China comparison suggests significant potential. Meesho, among the pioneers in India, is already at $1.4bn GMV (Mar-21 run-rate),&#8221; they added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato, a food delivery startup in India, said on Thursday it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">boosted its plan</a> to raise $1.3 billion in its initial public offering, which opens on July 14 and closes July 16.</p>
<p>The loss-making startup said it will price its shares in the range of 72 Indian rupees (96 cents) to 76 ($1) and is targeting an upper limit valuation of $8.56 billion.</p>
<p>Zomato, which competes with Swiggy (the market leader, according to several industry estimates), said after a successful IPO it will have about $2 billion in the bank. It plans to list on Indian stock exchanges.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 12-year-old Gurgaon-headquartered Indian startup &#8212; which counts Info Edge, Temasek, Tiger Global, and Ant Group among its largest investors and has raised over $2.2 billion to date &#8212; is the first high-profile tech startup in India to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>In a virtual press conference on Thursday, the startup executives said Zomato, which has search and discovery in nearly two dozen markets, will focus largely on India and will explore categories such as online grocery delivery in the future.</p>

<p>The executives dismissed Amazon as a serious competitor for now. “There&#8217;s no major impact on market share from Amazon so far,” the company&#8217;s chief financial officer said. Amazon entered the food delivery market last year and is operational in just Bangalore for now.</p>
<p>Zomato also revealed its latest financial on Thursday. For the financial year that ended in March this year, its revenue was down 23% to $283 million, and it also shrank its losses to $110 million, down 66% from the same period a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As most Indian edtech startups work on broadening their catalog with live and recorded courses for students, some are beginning to take a different approach to tackle the South Asian nation&#8217;s large education market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teachmint.com">Teachmint</a>, a one-year-old startup, is betting on empowering teachers to create their own virtual classrooms with a few taps on their smartphone.</p>
<p>The startup, which started its journey during the pandemic, has developed what it calls a mobile-first, video-first tech infrastructure to help teachers take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Teachmint’s offering has already amassed over 1 million teachers from over 5,000 Indian cities and the usage is growing over 100% each month, said Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Last month, students consumed over 25 million live classes on Teachmint, he said. Naturally investors are paying attention, too.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the startup said it has raised $20 million in a new investment led by Learn Capital and with participation from CM Ventures. The new investment, dubbed Pre-Series B, comes in less than two months after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/indian-online-teaching-platform-teachmint-raises-16-5-million/">closed its $16.5 million Series A funding</a>.</p>
<p>Other than taking a different approach to tackle the education space in India, where over 250 million students go to schools, another key thing that differentiates Teachmint is its in-house prowess with tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>Most startups today rely on scores of technology vendors for streaming their videos, cloud storage and processing tasks, and collecting fees. “Zoom and Google Meet are great services for talking to people. But they are not fundamentally designed to solve the needs of teachers and students,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>By not relying on other tech providers, Teachmint, which counts Lightspeed India Partners and Better Capital among its investors, has also been able to optimize its offerings more aggressively, said Gupta.</p>
<p>Through its proprietary approach, Teachmint said it is able to significantly control and improve the interactiveness in these classrooms. Having in-house technology offering also helps the startup spend only a fraction on each class, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a new category altogether. Any teacher can download the Teachmint app and create their first classroom within minutes. This ease of digitization of classroom didn&#8217;t exist before Teachmint,&#8221; he said, adding that more than 75% teachers on the platform use their smartphones to conduct classes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174958 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=300,118 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=768,302 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=680,268 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=1536,604 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/teachmint-app.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Teachers on Teachmint can also create public links of their classrooms and share it on Facebook and other platforms to create additional distribution channels.</p>
<p>Students also don&#8217;t need to jot down the entire session. Teachmint delivers the notes that teachers go through during their classes in real-time with students. This way, &#8220;teachers also don&#8217;t have to recreate their notes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The app, which supports 10 Indian languages (in addition to English), is just 14 megabytes in size and consistently ranks at &#8212; or among &#8212; the top education apps in Play Store in India.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the startup also announced a new product to serve schools and colleges. The product, called Teachmint for Institute, offers educational institutes a platform to conduct and monitor all their online classes and institute activities.</p>
<p>The expansion to this new category came after Teachmint, which consults with many teachers for building products and new features, learned that schools were struggling to collect fees from students amid the pandemic since these institutions were not able to continue their offerings in a structured way, said Gupta. And the pandemic, which last year prompted New Delhi to close schools, also made it less transparent for institutes to have visibility into how their classes were being conducted.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just 12 months, Teachmint has blossomed from a nascent idea to the #1 ranked education app in India – an unprecedented growth narrative for an Indian edtech company,&#8221; said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market resonance is a testament to the Teachmint team’s ongoing commitment to authentically incorporating teachers’ perspectives into the company’s ever-expanding suite of market-pioneering digital teaching tools. Having inaugurated its partnership with Teachmint just several months ago, Learn Capital is thrilled to now augment its partnership at this critical juncture in the company’s trajectory as it plans for exciting new product launches and international expansion.”</p>
<p>The startup will deploy the fresh funds to continue to expand its product offerings and hire talent, said Gupta. But more interestingly, he said, Teachmint is ready to expand outside of India and serve teachers in international markets.</p>
<p>With a flip of a switch, Gupta said he will make the offering available globally. &#8220;We don&#8217;t create content, so product is geography agnostic,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.younited-credit.com">Younited Credit</a> has raised a $170 million funding round. Goldman Sachs is leading the round with existing investors Eurazeo, Bpifrance and AG2R La Mondiale also participating. The company offers several credit products to European consumers. It also has a diversified distribution strategy.</p>
<p>Consumer credit in Europe is completely different from consumer credit in the U.S. Many countries don’t rely on a central credit score system to assess your credit worthiness. Similarly, most people don’t have a credit card. Financial institutions that want to offer credit lines have to evaluate the potential risk behind a credit application. It can be a complicated and tedious process.</p>
<p>Younited Credit differentiates itself from legacy players with a data-driven, AI-based approach. Instead of sending a ton of documents to your banker, Younited Credit tries to automate request processes as much as possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company takes advantage of DSP2 regulation and open banking APIs to ingest data. As the startup has facilitated a huge volume of credit offering, it can also leverage past data for machine learning risk models.</p>
<p>So far, Younited Credit has granted more than €2.4 billion in credit ($2.8 billion at today’s exchange rate). It operates in five European countries. France is still the company’s leading market as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany represent 40% of Younited Credit’s revenue.</p>
<p>More recently, the company started embedding its product into third-party products. For instance, banks and fintech companies offer credit products in their apps thanks to partnerships with Younited Credit. Examples include N26, Lydia, Orange Bank and Fortuneo. In 2021, the B2B offering represented 30% of Younited Credit’s net banking income.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mGMWPNzoRl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">Embedded finance might represent fintech&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Right now, Younited Credit has 440 employees. It plans to hire another 200 people over the next 18 months. The company wants to double down on European markets.</p>
<p>Up next, Younited Credit wants to double down on embedded finance with credit products that appear on the checkout page of popular e-commerce websites and apps. The company will compete with ‘buy now, pay later’ companies, such as Klarna, Floa, Oney, Scalapay, etc.</p>
<p>Named Younited Pay, the company plans to offer a wide range of options with payment terms spread over 3 to 48 months. Some companies are already using Younited Pay, such as Free, Micromania and LDLC.</p>
<p>The startup is offering this payment solution online and in brick-and-mortar stores. Once again, Younited Credit tries to find customers where they are already. And it seems like a smart move as physical points of sales represent over 50% of Younited Pay payments this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Many teachers and parents in Indonesia rely on WhatsApp to keep in touch, creating “multiple groups that often become messy and highly ineffective, and result in confusion or lost threads,” says Rizky Aniez, the co-founder and chief executive officer of <a href="https://gredu.asia/">Gredu</a>. The Jakarta-based startup was created to give everyone involved in the educational process—school administrators, teachers, parents, guardians and students—apps that let them keep track of everything and communicate with one another. Today it is announcing a $4 million Series A, led by Intudo Ventures, an Indonesia-focused venture capital firm, with participation from returning investor Vertex Ventures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">While some teachers use Google Classroom, Gredu was created to work with Indonesia’s K-12 National Curriculum and Islamic Curriculum programs, used in both private and public schools. The startup is also developing new verticals, including software for preschools and university programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Founded in September 2016, Gredu is now used by more than 400 schools, with a total of 400,000 users.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Its Series A will be used to expand in the Greater Jakarta Region and into major cities throughout Indonesia, plus product development and hiring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p1">Gredu’s subscription software is centered around a management system that lets administrators and teachers keep on touch of all their their tasks—including syllabuses, teaching schedules and communicating with parents and students. Aniez told TechCrunch that the onboarding process is simple, and “in an ideal solution, it can be done within hours.” Gredu was designed to be modular, so it can be customized to a school or district’s needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The platform currently has four main parts. Gredu School Management System was created for administrators, while Gredu Teacher lets educators track student attendance, create and score exams and arrange class activities.

<p class="p1">Gredu launched an Online Assignment feature before COVID-19 and during the pandemic, it added Interactive Class to enable remote learning. Aniez said the company plans to add new features and adapt Interactive Class for other uses once in-person schooling becomes the norm again. “We believe that many of the digitization in schools adopted during the pandemic will continue to be used for the future, changing the way administrators manage schools and improving transparency for local education authorities, teachers and parents,” he added.</p>
<p class="p1">Gredu is part of a crop of Indonesian edtech startups that have recently raised funding, including tuition platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/infradigital-helps-indonesian-schools-digitize-tuition-and-enrollment/">InfraDigital</a>; homework help and tutoring app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/indonesian-edtech-colearn-gets-10m-series-a-led-by-alpha-wave-incubation-and-gsv-ventures/">CoLearn</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/erudifi-raises-5-million-series-a-to-give-students-in-southeast-asia-more-education-financing-options/">ErudiFi</a> for education financing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In a statement, Intudo Ventures founding partner Patrick Yip said, “Working with school districts and administrators, GREDU provide innovative solutions specifically tailored to enhance the quality, transparency and effectiveness of Indonesia’s education system. We are proud to support GREDU at this critical juncture as they help more schools digitize their operations and create positive impact for students throughout Indonesia.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of 37 attorneys general filed a second major multi-state antitrust lawsuit against Google Wednesday, accusing the company of abusing its market power to stifle competitors and forcing consumers into in-app payments that grant the company a hefty cut.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is co-leading the suit alongside the Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah attorneys general. The bipartisan coalition represents 36 U.S. states, including California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Colorado and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through its illegal conduct, the company has ensured that hundreds of millions of Android users turn to Google, and only Google, for the millions of applications they may choose to download to their phones and tablets,&#8221; James said in a press release. &#8220;Worse yet, Google is squeezing the lifeblood out of millions of small businesses that are only seeking to compete.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In December, 35 states filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">a separate antitrust suit against Google</a>, alleging that the company engaged in illegal behavior to maintain a monopoly on the search business. The Justice Department filed its own antitrust case focused on search last October.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cjDsNj2dHa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/">Google slammed for &#8216;monopoly power&#8217; in new antitrust lawsuit from 35 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google slammed for &#8216;monopoly power&#8217; in new antitrust lawsuit from 35 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-antitrust-lawsuit-new-york-colorado-35-states-search/embed/#?secret=cjDsNj2dHa" data-secret="cjDsNj2dHa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the new lawsuit, embedded below, the bipartisan coalition of states allege that Google uses &#8220;misleading&#8221; security warnings to keep consumers and developers within its walled app garden, the Google Play store. But the fees that Google collects from Android app developers are likely the meat of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only has Google acted unlawfully to block potential rivals from competing with its Google Play Store, it has profited by improperly locking app developers and consumers into its own payment processing system and then charging high fees,&#8221; District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Google herds all app payment processing into its own service, Google Play Billing, and reaps the rewards: a 30 percent cut of all payments. Much of the criticism here is a case that could — and likely will — be made against Apple, which exerts even more control over its own app ecosystem. Google doesn&#8217;t have an iMessage equivalent exclusive app that keeps users locked in in quite the same way.</p>
<p>While the lawsuit discusses Google&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly power&#8221; in the app marketplace, the elephant in the room is Apple — Google&#8217;s thriving direct competitor in the mobile software space. The lawsuit argues that consumers face pressure to stay locked into the Android ecosystem, but on the Android side at least, much of that is ultimately familiarity and sunk costs. The argument on the Apple side of the equation here is likely much stronger.</p>
<p>The din over tech giants squeezing app developers with high mobile payment fees is just getting louder. The new multi-state lawsuit is the latest beat, but the topic has been white hot since Epic took Apple to court over its desire to bypass Apple&#8217;s fees by accepting mobile payments outside the App Store. When Epic set up a workaround, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">Apple kicked it out of the App Store</a> and Epic Games v. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">born</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/24/justice-department-anti-trust-apple-337120">reportedly already interested</a> in Apple&#8217;s own app store practices, along with many state AGs who could launch a separate suit against the company at any time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new pilot program from TikTok would inject a little LinkedIn into the youthful video-based social network.</p>
<p>TikTok announced that, starting today, it will invite users to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes">submit video resumes to participating companies</a>, including Target, Chipotle, Shopify, Meredith, NASCAR and the WWE. The company encourages applicants to show off their skills in a creative way while tagging the content with the hashtag #TikTokResumes.</p>
<p>The pilot program is TikTok&#8217;s latest effort to streamline the relationship between brands and creators, giving both even more reason to invest time and cash into the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;#CareerTok is already a thriving subculture on the platform and we can’t wait to see how the community embraces TikTok Resumes and helps to reimagine recruiting and job discovery,&#8221; TikTok Global Head of Marketing Nick Tran said of the pilot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2174889 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png" alt="TikTok resumes sample page" width="928" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-07-at-3.50.24-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p>The new pilot program will be discoverable through the dedicated hashtag and on standalone site <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/">tiktokresumes.com</a>, which also has some tips for applying and sample videos. On that site, anyone can browse job listings by employer and fill out a short questionnaire, attaching their video link. And yes, for better or worse, pointing potential employers to your LinkedIn profile is still encouraged.</p>
<p>TikTok views the new pilot as a &#8220;natural extension&#8221; of its college ambassador program, which recruits students to serve as on-campus representatives promoting the social network&#8217;s brand. The pilot program will accept TikTok resumes through July 31.</p>
<p>Of the participating brands listed on the new site, many openings are just for regular ol&#8217; jobs, like NASCAR seeking a sales rep and <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/hourly-warehouse-operations-woodland/">Target hunting for hourly warehouse workers</a> to cover the night shift. (Should we really be encouraging unemployed people to jump through more hoops to land gigs like this?)</p>
<p>Some listings are more tailored to the TikTok skill set, like an opening at All Recipes for on-camera talent to teach viewers how to make fluffy biscuits or a <a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/popsugar/">supervising social producer role at Popsugar</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional resume hasn&#8217;t changed much over the years — list the stuff you did, keep it on one page — but any brand hiring a social media manager or any other kind of content creator could be well served by TikTok&#8217;s latest creator economy experiment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve been hearing about BMW&#8217;s electric city scooters, not to be confused with electric kick scooters, for years. The German automaker came out with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/26/dont-call-bmws-futuristic-new-concept-motorbike-a-scooter/">BMW Motorrad Concept Link in 2017</a>, a concept vehicle that imagines the future of expensive micromobility. After revealing the latest concept scooter, the CE 04, in November 2020, BMW is now actually going through with production.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the company announced the new CE 04 will officially be a part of its 2022 lineup, with an expected global market launch of Q1. It&#8217;s a sweet-looking ride, with a decidedly retro-futuristic vibe, harkening back to what people in the 70s or 80s might have thought a &#8220;futuristic&#8221; vehicle would look like.</p>
<p>This is not the first electric scooter BMW has sold. Back in 2014, it came out with the C Evolution, which never really took off in the States. Maybe it was because it was ahead of its time. Maybe it&#8217;s because it cost $13,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The CE 04 starts at just around $12,000. Now, the whole point of the <a href="https://www.bmw-motorrad.com/en/experience/stories/urban-mobility/concept-link.html">BMW Motorrad Concept Link</a> is to provide &#8220;a vision of what will be important in the urban environment in the future,&#8221; so maybe BMW doesn&#8217;t care if it doesn&#8217;t crush it with sales. But until BMW produces something much cheaper than its gas equivalents <a href="https://firstcheckpoint.com/how-much-does-a-vespa-cost/">(you can buy a new Vespa for under $5,000</a>), the automaker’s new scooter is not guaranteed to take cities by storm.</p>
<p>With a 8.9 kWh battery pack, compared to the Evolution&#8217;s 12.7 kWh pack, BMW should be able to produce this vehicle and turn a profit for a lot less than it&#8217;s selling it for. Especially given the automaker&#8217;s access to higher quality technology and the cheaper price of batteries today when compared to five years ago.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for BMW Motorrad told TechCrunch the CE 04 is priced in the mid-range of the motorcycle market, and is still much less expensive than an electric car.</p>
<p>&#8220;This could be an entryway to electric mobility at a fraction of the cost for some people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Of course, the fanboys will go for it, like the one BMW fictionalized in a strange press release we&#8217;re trying really hard not to make fun of. Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s early in the morning. The city is awakening. On the way to my garage I breathe in the still cool air. I’m wear [sic] a casually cut parka that’s both fashionable and functional at the same time. The protectors are inconspicuous but give me a sense of security. I’m ready for the day to start.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, there&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first birds are chirping, the urban jungle is awakening. The sounds of the city begin to swell. Everything is set in motion. People move – with each other and in parallel. Paths cross.</p>
<p>What will the new day bring? Tapas with friends at the little bar by the river? Or the exhibition at the modern art museum? First of all there are appointments at the office. Workshops, meetings, customer visits. This is what life feels like.</p>
<p>I pair my smartphone with the scooter, and with a flick of my wrist I activate the parka. Its LEDs light up. I’m quiet, but I want to be seen. It’s all so simple and smooth.</p>
<p>We’re off again at last. Even when I was having my breakfast, I couldn’t wait. Not even the birds notice me. I glide almost silently through my neighbourhood. I’m a part of the city again.</p></blockquote>
<h3>One with the city</h3>
<p>[gallery ids="2174848,2174845,2174842,2174841,2174846,2174847,2174849,2174850"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The new BMW CE 04 is the logical and at the same time rethought continuation of BMW Motorrad’s electromobility strategy,&#8221; said Florian Römhild, project manager of the BMW CE 04, in a statement. &#8220;Urban areas are its element. This is where it sets a new benchmark – in terms of both technology and visual style.”</p>
<p>For the European and Asian markets, the CE 04 will be marketed as an urban vehicle, but in the U.S., where that category barely exists, the scooter will try to reach the urban commuter.</p>
<p>The CE 04 has a maximum output of 42 horsepower and a maximum speed of 75 miles per hour, meaning it can go on highways, the clogged arteries of America. It can ride for an estimated range of 80 miles and can be charged in under two hours using an at-home level 2 charger or any public charging station. Riders can choose ECO mode, Rain mode or Road mode to make driving efficient, and for those who want to kick it up a notch, there&#8217;s the Dynamic mode, part of the Premium package which costs an extra $1,650.</p>
<p>The avant-garde form follows function with the flat battery, which is placed in the middle of the vehicle, for smooth, low rides, as well as design freedom to include a storage compartment for the helmet and charging cable, which can be reached while sitting. The regenerative braking system helps feed energy back into the battery, which is likely to happen a lot if the rider is driving in the city.</p>
<p>As all modern vehicles should have, there&#8217;s a 10.25-inch color screen on the handlebars with integrated navigation and connectivity to the rider&#8217;s device, and there&#8217;s even a USB-C charging port.</p>
<p>The vehicle comes standard in &#8220;light white,&#8221; but to have the way more badass &#8220;Magellan grey metallic avant-garde&#8221; coloring, it&#8217;ll cost you an upgraded $225. Either way, both come with bright orange accents.</p>
<h3>More to come?</h3>
<p>&#8220;Our CEO said that because it&#8217;s an 04, there&#8217;s space under and over the 4, so I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s space for more electrified scooters in our future,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>BMW has no other specific models in the works, or timing on when they will be produced, but the CE 04 is part of <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/bmw-raises-target-ev-sales-plans-new-electric-focused-platform#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%202025,in%20hybrid%20vehicles%20by%202023.">BMW&#8217;s overall plan</a> to have delivered about 2 million full-electric vehicles to customers by 2025 and 10 million by 2030.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are moving so quickly we may see new additions to the CE range within a year or two,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3</span> 5</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/trump-twitter-facebook-youtube-lawsuits-section-230-first-amendment/">Former U.S. president needs money:</a></strong> The previous U.S. president, Donald Trump, made a laughingstock of himself today by announcing lawsuits against major social media companies. His arguments were instantly ridiculed. But Trump is already fundraising off his attempt to slander private companies, the media and generally anyone who doesn’t bow to his wishes. That’s what today’s brouhaha was actually about.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/the-single-vendor-requirement-ultimately-doomed-the-dods-10b-jedi-cloud-contract/">Why Microsoft’s big cloud deal fell apart:</a> </strong>We noted yesterday that the big Microsoft-U.S. military cloud deal was kaput. Today, Ron Miller explained why, namely that by trying to find a <em>single</em> vendor for the $10 billion deal, it was doomed from the start. Maybe the Department of Defense can figure out a multicloud approach. I bet there are a few startups willing to help if that’s the case.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/"><strong>India’s bonkers startup ecosystem:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch’s Manish Singh has been a force of nature since he joined, covering the Indian startup market with verve. Today he wrote &#8220;Dispatch from Banaglaore<em>.&#8221; </em>It’s amazing. Details include that India produced 16 unicorns this year and that its startups raised $10.46 billion in the first six months of 2021. Wild.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/investors-find-european-unicorns-reluctant-to-join-spac-boom/">How European unicorns are looking for exits:</a> </strong>U.S. companies are going public. European companies are going public. Chinese companies <em>were</em> going public. But the SPAC boom seems to be largely an American affair. Is that set to change? TechCrunch investigates.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">$100M for mmhmm:</a> </strong>Remember mmhmm, the startup that made neat Zoom tools earlier in the pandemic? It just raised a $100 million round. That’s a pile of ducats for the company. Let’s see what it can do with nine figures worth of capital. Also, Darrell’s headline was lovely for this piece &#8212; we awarded him 10 points.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Sure, we had to expand the TechCrunch Top 3 to five entries, but that doesn’t mean that there wasn’t another <em>mountain</em> of news to cover. Here’s your startup and venture capital highlight reel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/osso-vr-raises-27-million-to-turn-surgery-into-a-video-game/"><strong>Turning IRL surgery into a VR game:</strong></a><strong> </strong>News broke today that Osso VR, a San Francisco-based startup, raised $27 million to “upend modern surgical instruction with a virtual-reality-based solution that allows surgeons to interact with new medical devices in 3D space.” That means we can train more surgeons faster, right? If so, this is good news.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/r2c-raises-27m-to-scale-its-security-focused-code-analysis-service/">In which Alex tried to cover developer tools. Again.</a></strong> Today r2c, a startup that is building a SaaS service around the Semgrep open-source project, raised a preemptive Series B. I wrote about it, trying to explain a developer cybersecurity tool in the process. I give myself a B-, mostly for effort. The round is cool, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/tiger-global-leads-34m-investment-into-unit21-a-no-code-fraud-prevention-platform/"><strong>Today’s Tiger deal is Unit21:</strong></a> It wouldn’t be a weekday without a Tiger-led deal, right? Unit21 announced that the ever-present investing group led a $34 million Series B into its business, valuing it at around $300 million. The no-code, anti-fraud startup raised its Series A less than a year ago.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/opioid-addiction-treatment-apps-found-sharing-sensitive-data-with-third-parties/">Opioid-treatment apps are being a bit too free with their data collection:</a></strong> TechCrunch was not enthused.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pakistan’s growing tech ecosystem is finally taking off</h2>
<p>So far this year, startups in Pakistan are on track to raise more than in the previous five years combined, according to Mikal Khoso, an early-stage investor at Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even more excitingly, a large portion of this capital is coming from international investors from across Asia, the Middle East and even famed investors from Silicon Valley,&#8221; he notes in a guest post for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s identified three factors that are fueling investor interest: rapidly expanding mobile connectivity, an improved security situation, and critical legal and regulatory changes that are making the country more startup- and VC-friendly.</p>
<p>Drawing a map of Pakistan&#8217;s tech ecosystem, Khoso identifies local companies trying to grab a slice of grocery delivery, e-commerce, ride-hailing and other sectors before examining the challenges still in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The segments in Pakistan that are likely to attract the best entrepreneurs and most investor capital in the years to come will be fintech, e-commerce and edtech,&#8221; says Khoso.</p>

<p>Still here? Good. There’s even more news to get through. Let’s talk big companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satellite SPACs are here:</strong> Beep beep beep everyone, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">both Satellogic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">Planet</a> are going public via blank-check companies. Sure, you are tired of SPACs. But these deals are out of this world! Har har har.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/outbrain-raises-200-million-ahead-of-its-ipo/"><strong>$200M for Outbrain before it goes public:</strong></a> Ye olde bridge round is still a thing, it turns out. Outbrain, which TechCrunch described as “an adtech company that provides clickbait ads below news articles,” put together a huge round before its own debut.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign/">India’s tech oversight is shaking up:</a></strong> Keep an eye on what comes next.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amsterdam-based challenger bank <a href="https://www.bunq.com">Bunq</a> has been self-funded by its founder and CEO Ali Niknam for several years. But the company has decided to raise some external capital, leading to the largest Series A round for a European fintech company.</p>
<p>The startup is raising $228 million (€193 million) in a round led by <a href="https://www.pollencap.com">Pollen Street Capital</a>. Bunq founder Ali Niknam is also participating in the round — he’s investing $29.5 million (€25 million) while Pollen Street Capital is financing the rest of the round.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Bunq is also acquiring Capitalflow Group, an Irish lending company that was previously owned by … Pollen Street Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2012, Ali Niknam has already invested quite a bit of money into his own company. He poured $116.6 million (€98.7 million) of his own capital into Bunq — that doesn’t even take into account today’s funding round.</p>
<p>But it has paid off as the company expects to break even on a monthly basis in 2021. The company passed €1 billion in user deposits earlier this year. So why is the company raising external funding after turning down VC firms for so many years?</p>
<p>“Everything has a right time. In the beginning of Bunq, it was important to get a laser user focus in the company. Having to also focus on fundraises and the needs of investors distracts. Bunq now is mature enough to start scaling up significantly, so more capital is welcome,” Niknam said.</p>
<p>In particular, the company expects to acquire smaller companies to fuel its growth strategy. Challenger banks have also represented a highly competitive market over the past years in Europe. It’s clear that there will be some consolidation at some point.</p>
<p>Bunq offers bank accounts and debit cards that you can control from a mobile app. It works particularly well if your friends and family are also using Bunq as you can instantly send money, share a bunq.me payment link with other people, split payments and more.</p>
<p>In particular, if you’re going on a weekend trip, you can start an activity with your friends. It creates a shared pot that lets you share expenses with everyone. If you live with roommates, you can also create subaccounts to pay for bills from that account.</p>
<p>The company offers different <a href="https://www.bunq.com/benefits">plans</a> that range from €2.99 per month to €17.99 per month — there’s also a free travel card with a limited feature set. By choosing a subscription-based business model, the startup has a clear path to profitability as most users are paid users.</p>

		Jalal Nasir is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.pixalate.com/">Pixalate</a>, a global ad fraud intelligence and marketing compliance platform. Previously, he was one of the early engineers on Amazon’s fraud prevention and risk management team and held various product leadership roles building adtech and enterprise privacy technologies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Programmatic advertising is a <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/362815/ana-blasts-mind-numbing-programmatic-marketplace.html">$200 billion</a> global marketplace that is rapidly growing and far-reaching, with Connected TV (CTV) serving as its latest accelerant. Unfortunately, however, it’s also a business sector rife with fraud and consumer privacy abuse, particularly in emerging media forms like CTV and mobile.</p>
<p>Global losses to ad fraud <a href="https://www.thisisbeacon.com/resources/ad-fraud-industry-facts/">exceeded</a> $35 billion last year, a figure expected to rise to $50 billion by 2025, according to the <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2016/06/06/WFA-issues-first-advice-for-combatting-ad-fraud">World Federation of Advertisers</a>. Per the WFA, ad fraud is “second only to the drugs trade as a source of income for organized crime,” but there is no one-size-fits-all ad fraud strategy.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the promise of video advertising in mobile and CTV, and measure ad efficacy with confidence, business leaders must ensure that they’re reaching customers — not bots — and achieving their business goals while remaining compliant with the latest regulations and laws.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a few key steps business leaders can take to guard their reputation and their ad spend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy sophisticated tools to reveal the types of ad fraud attacks to which your ad budgets are falling prey.</li>
<li>Analyze your budget with quality versus reach in mind — fraudsters continue to take advantage of advertisers’ historic obsession with reach.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that the “Age of Privacy” has arrived; business leaders must remain compliant and protect their brand image in the ad marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Know the different types of ad fraud in CTV and mobile in-app to better protect your ad spend</h2>
<p>It’s important to consider the various ways your ad budgets can be squandered on invalid traffic. Although 78% of U.S. households are now reachable via programmatic CTV advertising, ad fraud rates remain high, at <a href="https://blog.pixalate.com/connected-tv-ctv-ott-ad-supply-trends-report-q4-2020">24% in Q4 2020</a>. Traditional ad fraud attacks, such as spoofing (i.e., pretending to be a different publisher) and fake sites or apps, are being supplanted by more advanced schemes, such as CTV device farms.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			Knowing that ad fraud is eating away at your budget is the first step, but business leaders need to understand the different schemes so they can apply the right protection in the right moments.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Knowing that ad fraud is eating away at your budget is the first step, but business leaders need to understand the different schemes so they can apply the right protection in the right moments.</p>
<h2>Looking at reach through a quality lens</h2>
<p>Historically, the standard way to measure advertising has been focused on reach. However, reach is now more of a vanity metric if uncoupled from traffic quality.</p>
<p>Striving for reach while ignoring quality creates a prime opportunity for ad fraud. Generating fake traffic to create the illusion of “reach” has become a staple in many ad fraud schemes, with some CTV schemes fabricating up to 650 million bid requests a day per day from bots, per <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/04/29/beware-the-bots-the-threat-ctv-ad-fraud-looms-viewership-rates-rise">The Drum</a>.</p>
<p>High impression rates that fail to convert into actual sales and pricing anomalies (as compared to a peer group) are compelling harbingers of traffic quality issues.</p>
<p>Because the growing CTV ecosystem commands premium pricing, advertisers may be tempted to seek out deals. However, several leading streaming TV providers, such as XUMO and Philo, have warned advertisers about prices that seem too good to be true, noting that they may be signals of fraudulent activity. Work to identify where traffic is coming from and ask questions when the data looks suspicious.</p>
<p>The ad industry itself is also fighting back by giving tools to business owners meant to stymie ad fraud. There are several industry working groups and watchdog organizations — including the Media Rating Council, Interactive Advertising Bureau and Trustworthy Accountability Group — that accredit certain platforms and suppliers to combat ad fraud. These working groups and organizations also regularly release industry standards and programs designed to address fraudulent activity, such as the Ads.txt initiative meant to help advertisers know they are buying inventory via legitimate third parties. All business owners should utilize certified platforms — along with emerging programs and standards — to stay on top of the latest trends in ad fraud.</p>
<h2>Business leaders need to prioritize brand safety and compliance</h2>
<p>In addition to navigating the complex world of ad quality, brands must now consider whether the publishers they are working with are brand safe and compliant with the latest consumer privacy and compliance laws.</p>
<p>Pixalate’s May 2021 estimates show that 22% of Apple App Store apps and 9% of Google Play Store apps that serve programmatic advertisements don’t have a privacy policy. This is significant because there are already documented cases of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/02/mobile-fraud-targets-swing-state-voters-in-russian-owned-app-with-history-of-white-supremacism/?sh=5bc47f543cc6">consumer data being misused as part of ad fraud schemes.</a> And 70% of Google Play Store apps have at least one of what Google calls “dangerous permissions,” an <a href="https://blog.pixalate.com/google-play-store-mobile-apps-dangerous-permissions-q3-2020">increase of 5%</a> in 2020. Additionally, of apps that serve programmatic ads, 80% of Apple App Store apps and 66% of Google Play Store apps count children aged 12 and under as part of their audience, which brings <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA compliance risks</a> into the equation as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play when it comes to brand safety that business leaders and brands should be aware of. The most important is that what is deemed “safe” for a brand is solely based on that brand — there is no golden standard because each brand has a different vision, mission and goals. Brand safety is subjective. However, it’s essential for success.</p>
<p>Ad fraud, brand safety and data compliance continually evolve, and leaders must follow the numbers, stay educated on market changes, and invest in the right partnerships to ensure consumers, not bots, are engaging with the <a href="https://www.pixalate.com/rankings/">most impactful and effective content</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa">Kobo&#8217;s Elipsa</a> is the latest in the Amazon rival&#8217;s e-reading line, and it&#8217;s a big one. The 10.3-inch e-paper display brings it up to iPad dimensions and puts it in direct competition with the reMarkable and Boox&#8217;s e-reader tablets. It excels on reading experience, gets by on note taking and drawing, but falls a bit short on versatility.</p>
<p>Kobo has been creeping upmarket for a few years now, and though the cheaper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/kobos-new-entry-level-clara-hd-e-reader-has-a-crisp-color-adjustable-display/">Clara HD</a> is still the pick of the litter in my opinion, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/kobos-forma-e-reader-takes-on-kindle-oasis-with-an-asymmetric-design-and-premium-price/">Forma</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/kobo-brings-brings-the-forma-form-factor-to-a-cheaper-model/">Libra H2O</a> are worthy competitors to the Kindle lines. The $400 Elipsa represents a big step up in size, function and price, and it does justify itself — though there are a few important caveats.</p>
<p>The device is well designed but lacks any flourishes. The tilted &#8220;side chin&#8221; of the Forma and Libra is flattened out into a simple wide bezel on the right side. The lopsided appearance doesn&#8217;t bother me much, and much of the competition has it as well. (Though my favorite is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/"> Boox&#8217;s ultracompact, flush-fronted Poke 3</a>)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Boox Poke 3 is my new favorite e-reader&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/embed/#?secret=Q7GnePj0g8" data-secret="Q7GnePj0g8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The 10.3&#8243; screen has a resolution of 1404 x 1872, giving it 227 pixels per inch. That&#8217;s well below the 300 PPI of the Clara and Forma, and the typography suffers from noticeably more aliasing if you look closely. Of course, you won&#8217;t be looking <em>that</em> closely, since as a larger device you&#8217;ll probably be giving the Elipsa a bit more distance and perhaps using a larger type size. I found it perfectly comfortable to read on — 227 PPI isn&#8217;t bad, just not the best.</p>
<p>There is a front light, which is easily adjustable by sliding your finger up and down the left side of the screen, but unlike other Kobo devices there is no way to change the color temperature. I&#8217;ve been spoiled by other devices and now the default cool grey I lived with for years doesn&#8217;t feel right, especially with a warmer light shining on your surroundings. The important part is that it is consistent across the full display and adjustable down to a faint glow, something my eyes have thanked me for many times.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to consider the Elipsa independent from the accessories it&#8217;s bundled with, and in fact there&#8217;s no way to buy one right now without the &#8220;sleep cover&#8221; and stylus. The truth is they really complete the package, though they do add considerably to its weight and bulk. What when naked is lighter and feels smaller than a standard iPad is heavier and larger once you put its case on and stash the surprisingly weighty stylus at the top.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174812" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174812" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174812" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174812" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The cover is nicely designed, if a bit stiff, and will definitely protect your device from harm. The cover, secured by magnets at the bottom, flips off like a sheet on a legal pad and folds flat behind the device, attaching itself with the same magnets from the other direction. A couple folds in it also stiffen up with further magnetic arrangement into a nice, sturdy little stand. The outside is a grippy faux leather and the inside is soft microfiber.</p>
<p>You can wake and turn off the device by opening and closing the cover, but the whole thing comes with a small catch: you have to have the power button, charging port and big bezel on the right. When out of its case the Elipsa can, like the others of its lopsided type, be inverted and your content instantly flips. But once you put it in the case, you&#8217;re locked in to a semi-right-handed mode. This may or may not bother people but it&#8217;s worth mentioning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174810" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174810" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1074 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1432 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174810" class="wp-caption-text">The Elipsa, center, with the Forma and reMarkable 2 to its left and right. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The reading experience is otherwise very similar to that on Kobo&#8217;s other devices. A relatively clean interface that surfaces your most recently accessed content and a not overwhelming but still unwelcome amount of promotional stuff (&#8220;Find your next great read&#8221;). E-books free and paid for display well, though it&#8217;s never been my preference to read on a large screen like this. I truly wish one of these large e-readers would make a landscape mode with facing pages. Isn&#8217;t that more booklike?</p>
<p>Articles from the web, synced via Pocket, look great and are a pleasure to read in this format. It feels more like a magazine page, which is great when you&#8217;re reading an online version of one. It&#8217;s simple, foolproof and well integrated.</p>
<h2>Kobo&#8217;s new note-taking prowess</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s new on the bottom row, though, is &#8220;Notebooks,&#8221; where unsurprisingly you can create notebooks for scribbling down lists, doodles, notes of course, and generally use the stylus.</p>
<p>The writing experience is adequate. Here I am spoiled by the reMarkable 2, which boasts extremely low lag and high accuracy, as well as much more expression in the line. Kobo doesn&#8217;t approach that, and the writing experience is fairly basic, with a noticeable amount of lag, but admirable accuracy.</p>
<p>There are five pen tips, five line widths and five line shades, and they&#8217;re all fine. The stylus has a nice heft to it, though I&#8217;d like a grippier material. Two buttons on it let you quickly switch from the current pen style to a highlighter or eraser, where you have stroke-deleting or brush modes. The normal notebooks have the usual gridded, dotted, lined and blank styles, and unlimited pages, but you can&#8217;t zoom in or out (not so good for artists).</p>
<p>Then there are the &#8220;advanced&#8221; notebooks, which you must use if you want handwriting recognition and other features. These have indelible lines on which you can write, and a double tap captures your words into type very quickly. You can also put in drawings and equations in their own sections.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174798" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174798" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174798 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg" alt="Handwriting is shown on the Elipsa tablet before and after conversion to typed text." width="1024" height="983" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=150,144 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=300,288 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=768,737 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=680,653 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=1536,1475 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=2048,1966 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting1.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174798" class="wp-caption-text">Close enough. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The handwriting recognition is fast and good enough for rough notes, but don&#8217;t expect to send these directly to your team without any editing. Likewise the diagram tool that turns gestural sketches of shapes and labels into finalized flowcharts and the like — better than the original wobbly art but still a rough draft. There are a few clever shortcuts and gestures to add or subtract spaces and other common tasks, something you&#8217;ll probably get used to fairly quick if you use the Elipsa regularly.</p>
<p>The notebook interface is snappy enough going from page to page or up and down on the &#8220;smart&#8221; notebooks but nothing like the fluidity of a design program or an art-focused one on an iPad. But it&#8217;s also unobtrusive, has good palm blocking, and feels nice in action. The lag on the line is definitely a con, but something you can get used to if you don&#8217;t mind the resulting product being a little sloppy.</p>

<p>You can also mark up e-books, which is nice for highlights but ultimately not that much better than simply selecting the text. And there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re writing in the margins with the limitations of this stylus.</p>
<p>Exporting notepads can be done via a linked Dropbox account or over USB connection. Again the reMarkable has a leg up here, for even if its app is a bit restrictive, the live syncing means you don&#8217;t ever have to worry about what version of what is where, as long as it&#8217;s in the system. On the Kobo it&#8217;s more traditional.</p>
<p>Compared to the reMarkable, the Kobo is really just an easier platform for everyday reading, so if you&#8217;re looking for a device that focuses on that and has the option of doodling or note taking on the side, it&#8217;s a much better deal. On the other hand, those just looking for an improvement to that stylus-focused tablet should look elsewhere — writing and sketching still feels way better on a reMarkable than almost anything on the market. Compared with something like a Boox tablet, the Elipsa is more simple and focused, but doesn&#8217;t allow the opportunity of adding Android apps and games.</p>
<p>At $400 — though this includes a case and stylus — the Elipsa is a considerable investment and comparably priced to an iPad, which is certainly a more versatile device. But I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy reading articles or books on my iPad, and the simplicity of an e-reader in general helps me focus when I&#8217;m making notes on a paper or something. It&#8217;s a different device for a different purpose, but not for everyone.</p>
<p>It is however probably the best way right now to step into the shallow end of the &#8220;big e-reader&#8221; pool, with more complex or expensive options available should you desire them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While crypto exchanges have demystified some of the largest cryptocurrencies for retail investors, many of the intricacies of decentralized finance are still lost on even more savvy investors as a result of DeFi&#8217;s weave of diverse offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://zerion.io/">Zerion</a>, a startup building a decentralized finance &#8220;interface&#8221; for crypto investors, has attracted venture capitalist attention on the back of recent growth. Amid a renewed crypto gold rush, the company has processed more than $600 million in transaction volume so far this year, now with over 200,000 monthly active users, CEO <span style="font-weight: 400;">Evgeny Yurtaev tells TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>The startup has also wrapped an $8.2 million Series A funding round led by Mosaic Ventures, with participation from Placeholder, DCG, Lightspeed and Blockchain.com Ventures, among others. Mosaic&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Coppel and Placeholder&#8217;s Brad Burnham have joined Zerion’s Board, the startup also shared.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zerion gives customers access to more than 50,000 digital assets and 60 protocols on the Ethereum blockchain through their app, which streamlines the UI of DeFi. Users can access tokens and invest through the app similar to exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, but do so using their own personal wallets like MetaMask, meaning user funds and private keys aren&#8217;t controlled by or accessible to Zerion, a sticking point for Yurtaev, a lifelong crypto enthusiast and builder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174806" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174806" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174806 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png" alt="" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png 5200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=1536,945 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=2048,1260 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zerion</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There are a bunch of different tokens and protocols in the DeFi space,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yurtaev says. &#8220;</span>In theory, it’s supposed to be easy to navigate, but in reality, it&#8217;s all a mess … We try to demystify them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside major growth in Ethereum and bitcoin prices, DeFi volume has surged in 2021, up from just under $20 billion at the year&#8217;s start to nearly $90 billion this May. The DeFi market at large has proven just as volatile as bitcoin, with market volume falling some 35% in the past couple months to just over $57 billion.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s mobile app on iOS and Android has become a particularly popular way for crypto investors to track the market and the tokens they&#8217;re backing. The average user opens the app more than nine times per day, the company says.</p>
<p>Crypto&#8217;s 2021 upswing has drawn plenty of investor attention, not only to the assets themselves but to the platforms facilitating those transactions. Last month, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that they had raised more than $2.2 billion to invest in startups building products in crypto spaces including decentralized finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/trump-lawsuit-tech-companies/">spicy trio of lawsuits</a> against the social media platforms that he believes wrongfully banned him have succeeded in showering the former president with a flurry of media attention, but that&#8217;s likely where the story ends.</p>
<p>Like Trump&#8217;s quixotic and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">ultimately empty quest to gut Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act during his presidency</a>, the new lawsuits are all sound and fury with little legal substance to back them up.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/embed/#?secret=62sAxCkXoO" data-secret="62sAxCkXoO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The suits allege that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube violated Trump&#8217;s First Amendment rights by booting him from their platforms, but the First Amendment is intended to protect citizens from censorship by the government — not private industry. The irony that Trump himself was the uppermost figure in the federal government at the time probably won&#8217;t be lost on whoever&#8217;s lap this case lands in.</p>
<p>In the lawsuits, which also name Twitter and Facebook chief executives Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai (Susan Wojcicki escapes notice once again!), Trump accuses the three companies of engaging in &#8220;impermissible censorship resulting from threatened legislative action, a misguided reliance upon Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and willful participation in joint activity with federal actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit claims that the tech companies colluded with &#8220;Democrat lawmakers,&#8221; the CDC and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who served in Trump&#8217;s own government at the time.</p>
<p>The crux of the argument is that communication between the tech companies, members of Congress and the federal government somehow transforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube into &#8220;state actors&#8221; — a leap of epic proportions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendant Twitter&#8217;s status thus rises beyond that of a private company to that of a state actor, and as such, Defendant is constrained by the First Amendment right to free speech in the censorship decisions it makes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump&#8217;s own Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1702_h315.pdf">issued the court&#8217;s opinion on a relevant case two years ago</a>. It examined whether a nonprofit running public access television channels in New York qualified as a &#8220;state actor&#8221; that would be subject to First Amendment constraints. The court ruled that running the public access channels didn&#8217;t transform the nonprofit into a government entity and that it retained a private entity&#8217;s rights to make editorial decisions.</p>
<p>&#8221; … A private entity … who opens its property for speech by others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor,&#8221; Justice Kavanaugh wrote in the decision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not likely that a court would decide that talking to the government or being threatened by the government somehow transform Twitter, YouTube and Facebook into state actors either.</p>

<h3>Trump vs. Section 230 (again)</h3>
<p>First Amendment aside — and there&#8217;s really not much of an argument there — social media platforms are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a concise snippet of law that shields them from liability not just for the user-generated content they host but for the moderation decisions they make about what content to remove.</p>
<p>In line with Trump&#8217;s obsessive disdain for tech&#8217;s legal shield, the lawsuits repeatedly rail against Section 230. The suits try to argue that because Congress threatened to revoke tech&#8217;s 230 protections, that forced them to ban Trump, which somehow makes social media companies part of the government and subject to First Amendment constraints.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/section-230-stimulus-mcconnell-bill-trump/">Republican lawmakers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/tech-giants-immunities-encryption/">Trump&#8217;s own administration</a> made frequent threats about repealing Section 230, not that it changes anything because this line of argument doesn&#8217;t make much sense anyway.</p>
<p>The suit also argues that Congress crafted Section 230 to intentionally censor speech that is otherwise protected by the First Amendment, ignoring that the law was born in 1996, well before ubiquitous social media, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">and for other purposes altogether</a>.</p>

<p>For the four years of his presidency, Trump&#8217;s social media activity — his tweets in particular — informed the events of the day, both nationally and globally. While other world leaders and political figures used social media to communicate or promote their actions, Trump&#8217;s Twitter account was usually the action itself.</p>
<p>In the shadow of his social media bans, the former president has failed to reestablish lines of communication to the internet at large. In May, he launched a new blog, &#8220;From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,&#8221; but the site was taken down just a month later after it <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/02/donald-trump-blog-fail-491667">failed to attract much interest</a>.</p>
<p>The handful of pro-Trump alternative social platforms are still struggling with app store content moderation requirements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/apple-confirms-it-will-allow-parler-to-return-to-app-store/">at odds with their extreme views</a> on free speech, but that didn&#8217;t stop Gettr, the latest, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/gettr-trump-social-network-hack-defaced/">going ahead with its own rocky launch last week</a>.</p>
<p>Viewed in one light, Trump&#8217;s lawsuits are a platform too, his latest method for broadcasting himself to the online world that his transgressions eventually cut him off from. In that sense, they seem to have succeeded, but in all other senses, they won&#8217;t.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[By streamlining the process to fail fast on infeasible projects, teams can significantly increase their overall success with AI initiatives. 
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI teams invest a lot of rigor in defining new project guidelines. But the same is not true for killing existing projects. In the absence of clear guidelines, teams let infeasible projects drag on for months.</p>
<p>They put up a dog and pony show during project review meetings for fear of becoming the messengers of bad news. By streamlining the process to fail fast on infeasible projects, teams can significantly increase their overall success with AI initiatives.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In order to fail fast, AI initiatives should be managed as a conversion funnel analogous to marketing and sales funnels.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>AI projects are different from traditional software projects. They have a lot more unknowns: availability of right datasets, model training to meet required accuracy threshold, fairness and robustness of recommendations in production, and many more.</p>
<p>In order to fail fast, AI initiatives should be managed as a conversion funnel analogous to marketing and sales funnels. Projects start at the top of the five-stage funnel and can drop off at any stage, either to be temporarily put on ice or permanently suspended and added to the AI graveyard. Each stage of the AI funnel defines a clear set of unknowns to be validated with a list of time-bound success criteria.</p>
<p>The AI project funnel has five stages:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174118" style="width: 992px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174118" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2174118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png" alt="" width="982" height="824" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png 982w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=768,644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sandeep Uttamchandani</p></div></p>
<h2>1. Problem definition: “If we build it, will they come?”</h2>
<p>This is the top of the funnel. AI projects require significant investments not just during initial development but ongoing monitoring and refinement. This makes it important to verify that the problem being solved is truly worth solving with respect to potential business value compared to the effort to build. Even if the problem is worth solving, AI may not be required. There might be easier human-encoded heuristics to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Developing the AI solution is only half the battle. The other half is how the solution will actually be used and integrated. For instance, in developing an AI solution for predicting customer churn, there needs to be a clear understanding of incorporating attrition predictions in the customer support team workflow. A perfectly powerful AI project will fail to deliver business value without this level of integration clarity.</p>
<p>To successfully exit this stage, the following statements need to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AI project will produce tangible business value if delivered successfully.</li>
<li>There are no cheaper alternatives that can address the problem with the required accuracy threshold.</li>
<li>There is a clear path to incorporate the AI recommendations within the existing flow to make an impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, the early stages of the project have a higher ratio of aspiration compared to ground realities. Killing an ill-formed project can avoid teams from building “solutions in search of problems.”</p>
<h2>2. Data availability : “We have the data to build it.”</h2>
<p>At this stage of the funnel, we have verified the problem is worth solving. We now need to confirm the data availability to build the perception, learning and reasoning capabilities required in the AI project. Data needs vary based on the type of AI project  —  the requirements for a project building classification intelligence will be different from one providing recommendations or ranking.</p>
<p>Data availability broadly translates to having the right quality, quantity and features. Right quality refers to the fact that the data samples are an accurate reflection of the phenomenon we are trying to model  and meet properties such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a>. Common quality checks involve uncovering data collection errors, inconsistent semantics and errors in labeled samples.</p>
<p>The right quantity refers to the amount of data that needs to be available. A common misconception is that a significant amount of data is required for training machine learning models. This is not always true. Using pre-built transfer learning models, it is possible to get started with very little data. Also, more data does not always mean <em>useful</em> data. For instance, historic data spanning 10 years may not be a true reflection of current customer behavior. Finally, the right features need to be available to build the model. This is typically iterative and involves ML model design.</p>
<p>To successfully exit this stage, the following statements need to be true:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The harsh truth: Some of the advice you read about marketing is incorrect.</p>
<p>While not always <em>intentionally</em> misleading, you&#8217;re often absorbing content written by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketers without a breadth of experience</strong>: People who&#8217;ve marketed a single product and have a limited — or biased — view on a channel.</li>
<li><strong>Non-practitioners</strong>: People who&#8217;ve never run experiments, but pass along (sometimes outdated) marketing insights that they&#8217;ve read online.</li>
</ul>
<p>After running thousands of experiments for brands like Microsoft, Segment and Perfect Keto, here are 10 significant lies we&#8217;ve realized you&#8217;ve been told about marketing (on email marketing, ads and referrals).</p>
<h2>1. &#8220;Send a welcome email immediately after signup.&#8221;</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s better to avoid sending emails right after people sign up on your site. We’re used to getting generic, unimportant welcome emails every time we sign up for anything online. So most people will reflexively discard your welcome email as spam.</p>
<p>Instead, try delaying your welcome email by 15 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The delay removes the subscriber&#8217;s mental connection between signup and your email, bypassing the reflex to ignore.</p>
<p>As a result, you&#8217;ll likely get more opens and more engagement.</p>
<h2>2. &#8220;Only highlight your best product reviews.&#8221;</h2>
<p>For context, reviews are a big deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% of consumers claim product reviews impact purchase decisions.</li>
<li>The social proof of having 50+ product reviews increases conversion. Shoppers trust peers more than they trust brands.</li>
</ul>
<p>But imperfect reviews can generate more sales than five-star ones. How?</p>
<p>When a partially negative review weighs your cons versus your pros and concludes that the product was worth purchasing anyway, that sounds authentic and honest.</p>
<p>In contrast, strings of flawless five-star reviews don&#8217;t signal authenticity. Psychologically, they’re less likely to sink in as positive social proof.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your post-purchase email flow contains a request for reviews. The more reviews you have, the better.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bury slightly negative reviews. If someone leaves a four-star review and offers a fair (and insignificant) critique, showcase it toward the top of your product page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. &#8220;You have to send a newsletter every week.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Most newsletters shouldn&#8217;t be sent weekly. This goes against what most creator economy entrepreneurs suggest.</p>
<p>But high cadences force newsletter writers to rush and publish lower-quality information to hit self-imposed deadlines.</p>
<p>Instead, consider only sending when you truly have value to add. At a minimum, consider setting a more reasonable cadence like once or twice a month so that you&#8217;ll have enough time and content to consistently hit a high-quality bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual reality did not turn into the ultimate office replacement telepresence machine during the pandemic &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t for lack of trying &#8212; but some startups focused on employee training in VR have found added validation in the past year as professionals across industries were forced to access institutional knowledge in remote settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://ossovr.com/">Osso VR</a>, a San Francisco-based virtual reality startup focused on medical training, has piqued investor attention as they&#8217;ve bulked up on partnerships with medical devices powerhouses like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker and Smith &amp; Nephew during the pandemic. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve recently closed $27 million in Series B funding led by GSR Ventures with additional participation from SignalFire, Kaiser Permanente Ventures and Anorak Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>CEO Justin Barad tells TechCrunch that the pandemic &#8220;created an intense level of urgency&#8221; for the startup as customers found new demand for their platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Osso VR is looking to upend modern surgical instruction with a virtual reality-based solution that allows surgeons to interact with new medical devices in 3D space, &#8220;performing&#8221; a surgery over and over on a digital cadaver from the comfort of anywhere they have enough room to stretch out their arms. Osso&#8217;s efforts are particularly useful to its medical device customers who can use the platform to boost familiarity with their solutions while helping surgeons gain proficiency in implanting them.</p>
<p>One of the startup&#8217;s broader aims is to bring video games&#8217; multiplayer mechanics into the virtual operating room, allowing surgeons and medical assistants to collaborate in real-time so they not only know their responsibility but how they fit into the whole of each operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a lot like a symphony, everyone has a different role to play and you need to communicate with each other.&#8221; Barad says.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Wo3z7GNkY0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/training-platform-virti-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-to-teach-soft-skills-in-vr/">Training platform Virti raises $10M Series A led by IQ Capital to teach soft skills in VR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Training platform Virti raises $10M Series A led by IQ Capital to teach soft skills in VR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/training-platform-virti-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-to-teach-soft-skills-in-vr/embed/#?secret=Wo3z7GNkY0" data-secret="Wo3z7GNkY0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a process that needs virtual reality&#8217;s spatial breadth, Barad notes, though instruction is always supplemented by text and videos as well.</p>
<p>Barad calls the startup&#8217;s aim &#8220;something unambiguously good,&#8221; a quality which has helped the team poach talent as it has scaled to some 100 employees, which includes what he claims is the world&#8217;s largest team of medical illustrators. That team has helped scale the platform&#8217;s content to more than 100 modules spanning 10 specialties.</p>
<p>Virtual reality founders have struggled in recent years to coax investor attention as consumer and enterprise uptake has proven slower than the early wild ambitions for the technology. In its stead, investors have looked more towards bets on adjacent technologies like gaming and computer vision that don&#8217;t require the specialized head-worn hardware. Osso VR&#8217;s platform runs on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest 2 headset through the company&#8217;s Oculus for Business program.</p>

<p>After years of lagging behind, over the course of the past 18 months, Pakistan’s technology ecosystem has come to life in unprecedented fashion. In 2021, Pakistani startups are on track to raise more money than the previous five years combined. Even more excitingly, a large portion of this capital is coming from international investors from across Asia, the Middle East and even famed investors from Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>The rapid emergence of Pakistan’s technology ecosystem on the international stage has been no accident &#8212; it’s the result of a confluence of changing facts on the ground and shifting dynamics in the startup and investing world as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Unlocking Pakistan’s potential</h2>
<p>The sudden emergence of Pakistan’s tech ecosystem on the international stage has been driven by three major factors: an improving security situation, quickly growing mobile connectivity, and critical legal changes and deregulation.</p>
<p>As a frontline state and coalition partner in the United States’ invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan saw <a href="https://www.satp.org/datasheet-terrorist-attack/fatalities/pakistan">fatalities from terrorist violence soar</a> from 295 in 2001 to a peak of over 11,000 in 2009. This climate of instability and violence scared away international business and investors from Pakistan for much of the first two decades of the 21st century.</p>
