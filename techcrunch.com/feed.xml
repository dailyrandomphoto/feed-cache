										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The creators behind CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects on the web, just revealed their latest project called <a href="https://meebits.larvalabs.com/meebits/publicsale">Meebits</a>. The project boasts 20,000 procedurally generated 3D characters that are tradeable on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of 3D avatar NFT platforms popping up over the past several months hoping to gain momentum and capture the enthusiasm of crypto buyers, but the traction of the Larva Labs team whose pixel portrait CryptoPunks project has netted more than $550 million in lifetime sales will likely make this platform another hit. Meebits arrives at a time of peak hype for their first effort CryptoPunks which is weeks away from a Christie&#8217;s auction that many are expecting to see fetch a price in the tens of million of dollars. It also arrives as Ethereum has had one of its best weeks on record, punching through all-time-highs nearly every day this week. Ethereum is currently trading at just shy of $3,300.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the Larva Labs creators posit that they hope that Meebits will eventually serve as avatars for &#8220;virtual worlds, games and VR.&#8221; Meebits not only boast a revised art style, but Larva Labs has made some underlying changes to the no-fee marketplace, the most significant of which is likely the ability to customize trades allowing users to swap Meebits with each other in a more complex manner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">my profile</a> of the company&#8217;s CryptoPunks project last month, the team&#8217;s founders hoped that their new project would lower the barrier of entry as CryptoPunks prices reached stratospheric heights, it seems that even by doubling the total supply (20,000 avatars versus CryptoPunks 10,000 figures) Meebits are poised to still be an expensive affair.</p>
<p>The company is <a href="https://meebits.larvalabs.com/meebits/publicsale">distributing the Meebits</a> avatars through a Dutch auction, meaning the price for buying and minting a Meebit will lower to zero Eth (plus Ethereum gas fees) over the course of a week. Currently users are paying 2.49 Eth to mint a Meebit a random, a nearly $8,500 investment at current prices. Nevertheless, around 2,000 of them have already sold, meaning the creators have already pulled in nearly $20 million worth of Eth after just over two hours on the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Competitors Volvo AB and Daimler Trucks are teaming up to produce hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, which the companies say will lower development costs and boost production volumes. The joint venture, which is called cellcentric, aims to bring large-scale &#8220;gigafactory&#8221; production levels of hydrogen fuel cells to Europe by 2025.</p>
<p>While the two companies are teaming up to produce the fuel cells via the cellcentric venture, all other aspects of truck production will remain separate. The location of the forthcoming gigafactory will be announced next year. The companies also did not specify the production capacity of the forthcoming factory.</p>
<p>Even as Volvo AB and Daimler Trucks used ambition-signaling terms like &#8220;gigafactory&#8221; — a term popularized by Tesla due to the giga capacity of its factories — executives added a few cautionary caveats to their goal. Europe’s hydrogen economy will depend in part on whether the European Union can produce a policy framework that further drives down costs and invests in refueling stations and other infrastructure, executives noted in a media briefing. In other words, manufacturers like Daimler and Volvo that are looking to invest in hydrogen face a &#8220;chicken and the egg&#8221; problem: boosting fuel cell production only makes sense if it occurs in tandem with the buildout of a hydrogen network, including refueling stations, pipelines to transport hydrogen and renewable energy resources to produce it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In the long run, I mean, this must be a business-driven activity as everything else,” Volvo CTO Lars Stenqvist told TechCrunch. “But in the first wave, there must be support from our politicians.”</p>
<p>Together with other European truck manufacturers, the two companies are calling for a buildout of hydrogen refueling stations around Europe of around 300 by 2025 and around 1,000 by 2030.</p>
<p>The Swedish and German automakers suggested policies such as a tax on carbon, incentives for CO2-neutral technologies or an emissions trading system could all help ensure cost-competitiveness against fossil fuels. Heavy-duty trucking will only compose a fraction of hydrogen demand, around 10%, Stenqvist pointed out, with the rest being used by industries such as steel manufacturing and the chemical industry. That means the push for hydrogen-supportive policies will likely be heard from other sectors, as well.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for the new venture will be working to decrease inefficiencies associated with converting hydrogen to electricity. “That’s the core of engineering in trucking, to improve the energy efficiency of the vehicle,” Stenqvist said. “That has always been in the DNA of engineers in our industry &#8230; energy efficiency will be even more important in an electrified world.” He estimated that the cost of hydrogen would need to be in the range of $3-4 per kilogram to make it a cost-effective alternative to diesel.</p>
<p>Volvo is also making investments in battery electric technologies and Stenqvist said he sees potential use cases for internal combustion engines (ICE) run on renewable biofuels. He is in agreement with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bosch-sees-a-place-for-renewable-fuels-challenging-proposed-european-union-engine-ban/">Bosch executives who said</a> earlier this month that they see a place for ICE in the future. “I&#8217;m also convinced that there is a place for the combustion engines for a long period of time, I don&#8217;t see any end, I don&#8217;t see any retirement date for the combustion engines,” he said.</p>
<p>“From a political side, I think it would be completely wrong to ban a technology. Politicians should not ban &#8212; should not approve technologies &#8212; they should point out the direction, they should talk about what they want to achieve. And then it&#8217;s up to us as engineers to come up with the technical solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several years I&#8217;ve covered my fair share of upstart avatar companies that were all chasing the same dream &#8212; building out a customizable platform for a digital persona that gained wide adoption across games and digital spaces. Few of those startups I&#8217;ve covered in the past are still around. But by netting a string of successful partnerships with celebrity musicians, LA-based <a href="https://genies.com/">Genies</a> has come closer than any startup before it to realizing the full vision of a wide-reaching avatar platform.</p>
<p>The company announced today that they&#8217;ve closed a $65 million Series B led by Mary Meeker&#8217;s firm Bond. NEA, Breyer Capital, Tull Investment Group, NetEase, Dapper Labs and Coinbase Ventures also participated in the deal. Mary Meeker will be joining the Genies board. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the Genies&#8217; most recent valuation.</p>
<p>This funding comes at an inflection point for the eight-year-old company, evidenced by the investments from NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs and crypto giant Coinbase. As announced last week, the company is rolling out an NFT platform on Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain, partnering closely with the startup, which will be building out the backend for a Genies avatar accessories storefront. Like Dapper Labs has leveraged its exclusive deals with sports leagues to ship NFTs with official backing, Genies is planning to capitalize on its partnerships with celebrities in its roster, including Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and others to create a platform for buying and trading avatar accessories en masse.</p>
<p>In October, the company announced a brand partnership with Gucci, opening the startup to another big market opportunity.</p>

<p>Genies&#8217; business has largely focused on leveraging high-profile partnerships to give its entertainer clients a digital presence that can spice up what they&#8217;re sharing on social media and beyond. As they&#8217;ve rolled out avatar creation to all users through beta mobile apps, Genies has been focusing on one of the more explicit dreams of the avatar companies before it; building out a broad network of avatar users and a broad network of compatible platforms through its SDK.</p>

<p>&#8220;An avatar is a vehicle to be able to showcase more of your authentic self,&#8221; Genies CEO Akash Nigam tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not limited by real-world constraints, it’s an alter-ego personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trends in the NFT world have provided new realms of exploration for Genies, but so have broader pandemic-era trends that have pushed more users to wholly digital spaces where they socialize and connect. &#8220;The pandemic accelerated everything,&#8221; Nigam says.</p>
<p>Nigam emphasizes that despite the major opportunity its upcoming NFT platform will present, Genies is still an avatar company first-and-foremost, not an NFT startup, though he does say he is believes crypto-backed digital goods are going to be around for a long time. He has few doubts that the current environment around digital goods helped juice Genies&#8217; funding round, which he says was &#8220;6-8X oversubscribed&#8221; and was an opportunistic play for the startup, which &#8220;could have gone years without having to raise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says their crypto marketplace will launch in the coming months, as early as this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter Spaces, the company&#8217;s new live audio rooms feature, is opening up more broadly. The company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/spaces-is-here.html">announced</a> today it&#8217;s making Twitter Spaces available to any account with 600 followers or more, including both iOS and Android users. It also officially unveiled some of the features it&#8217;s preparing to launch, like Ticketed Spaces, scheduling features, reminders, support for co-hosting, accessibility improvements and more.</p>
<p>Along with the expansion, Twitter is making Spaces more visible on its platform, too. The company notes it has begun testing the ability to find and join a Space from a purple bubble around someone&#8217;s profile picture right from the Home timeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146780" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146780" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HTL_Loop.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter says it decided on the 600 follower figure as being the minimum to gain access to Twitter Spaces based on its earlier testing. Accounts with 600 or more followers tend to have &#8220;a good experience&#8221; hosting live conversations because they have a larger existing audience who can tune in. However, Twitter says it&#8217;s still planning to bring Spaces to all users in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s speeding ahead with new features and developments. Twitter has been building Spaces in public, taking into consideration user feedback as it prioritizes features and updates. Already, it has built out an <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_DannySingh/status/1361791468877324292?s=20">expanded set of audience management controls</a>, as users requested, introduced a way for hosts to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1385347169620738051?s=20">mute all speakers at once</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1353797113482792961?s=20">added the laughing emoji</a> to its set of reactions, after users requested it.</p>

<p>Now, its focus is turning toward creators. Twitter Spaces will soon support <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_DannySingh/status/1369023280259141635?s=20">multiple co-hosts</a>, and creators will be able to better market and even charge for access to their live events on Twitter Spaces. One feature, arriving in the next few weeks, will allow users to schedule and set reminders about Spaces they don&#8217;t want to miss. This can also help creators who are marketing their event in advance, as part of the RSVP process could involve pushing users to &#8220;set a reminder&#8221; about the upcoming show.</p>
<p>Twitter Spaces&#8217; rival, Clubhouse, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">just announced a reminders feature</a> during its townhall event on Sunday as well at the start of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">external Android testing</a>. The two platforms, it seems, could soon be neck-and-neck in terms of feature set.</p>

<p>But while Clubhouse recently launched an in-app donations feature as a means of supporting favorite creators, Twitter will soon introduce a more traditional means of generating revenue from live events: selling tickets. The company says it&#8217;s working on a feature that will allow hosts to set ticket prices and how many are available to a given event, in order to give them a way of earning revenue from their Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>A limited group of testers will gain access to Ticketed Spaces in the coming months, Twitter says. Unlike Clubhouse, which has yet to tap into creator revenue streams, Twitter will take a small cut from these ticket sales. However, it notes that the &#8220;majority&#8221; of the revenue will go to the creators themselves.</p>

<p>Twitter also noted that it&#8217;s improving its accessibility feature, live captions, so they can be paused and customized, and is working to make them more accurate.</p>
<p>The company will be hosting a Twitter Space of its own today around 1 PM PT to further discuss these announcements in more detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When the iconic American power tools company <a href="https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaFg97_Rvbf7VquxXN_UmYwTPX8g">Stanley Black &amp; Decker</a> began looking for ways to improve the pipeline of diverse candidates that the company was reviewing for potential roles, it turned to an Israeli-based startup called <a href="https://www.talenya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.talenya.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4jrHr-abaZY3QsiM8wOaTqQhfnw">Talenya</a> for help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company wasn’t alone in looking to startups for support in new hiring initiatives. Last year’s social reckoning that occurred in the wake of nationwide protests against systemic racism triggered by the murder of George Floyd pushed companies around the country to reassess their own role in perpetuating inequality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of that assessment, companies came to the realization that the hiring tools they’d been using to simplify the process of recruiting, cultivating and promoting talent weren’t capturing the broadest and most capable applicants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“If we want to claim that it’s a pipeline issue, we would first have to claim that we’ve hired what is available in the pipeline,” Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFTOneKo2KTItRQCp3OsIzqp15BQ">told TechCrunch</a>. “It’s not a pipeline issue as much as it is a recruiting process challenge.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDFGxaDiz9"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Examining the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Examining the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/embed/#?secret=hDFGxaDiz9" data-secret="hDFGxaDiz9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">That’s where tools like Talenya, Textio, TalVista, WayUp, Handshake, The Mom Project, Flockjay, Kanarys, JumpStart and SeekOut have come in. All told, these companies have raised more than $200 million in financing over the past few years to increase diversity and inclusion and help solve tech’s diversity problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Part of our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy focuses on having a diverse pipeline to ensure incoming talent better reflects the markets and communities we serve. To accelerate our progress, we started using Talenya’s AI software in 2020 to help increase the candidate pool of women and people of color,” said Suzan Morno-Wade, EVP and chief human resources officer at Xerox, another company using Talenya’s software, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It seems that women and people of color use fewer keywords and are less effusive when they describe themselves in profiles or on job applications, according <a href="https://www.talenya.com/exploring-the-recruitment-pipline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.talenya.com/exploring-the-recruitment-pipline/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2XSZCUsZ60vLoOMXwpYqlGUYzkQ">to a recent study published by Talenya</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why startups like Talenya and Textio try to highlight how to improve the screening process for candidates by using broader language in both the text of the job description (Textio) and in the filters used to select qualified candidates (Talenya).</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Keyword search is highly discriminatory to everyone,” said Talenya chief executive and co-founder Gal Almog. “Minorities and women tend to put 20% to 30% less skills on their profiles. That applies not only to women and to minorities. We added an algorithm that can predict and add missing skills.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In some ways, that functionality seems a lot like tools on offer from companies like SeekOut, the recruiting startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnT8bv-d01ZN0NKFzK2bp8rjPFbQ">just landed a whopping $65 million round</a> from investors including Tiger Global, Madrona Group and Mayfield.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The focus on diversity hiring and our unique approach to finding the talent and offering blind hiring features has super charged the adoption,” chief executive Anoop Gupta said in an interview earlier this year. That same toolkit is something that Talenya pitches its own customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, businesses like WayUp are attempting to give employers a window into how the funnel narrows after the screening process. The company’s new tool provides an assessment for how diverse applicant pools are slowly winnowed down to a group of candidates that is far less diverse through the testing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WayUp co-founder and chief executive Liz Wessel said that the pool of applicants often narrows significantly after a battery of technical assessment and programming tests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Similar to the SATs, many technical assessments have high correlation to socioeconomics status,” Wessel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While some startups focus on the hiring process itself, other companies are taking approaches to diversify-specific jobs or to try to recruit from particular talent pools to help increase diversity in the tech industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s the mission that companies like <a href="https://flockjay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flockjay.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpPeBdCHkcyaxjXnhOQFfuU2jweg">Flockjay</a> and <a href="https://themomproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://themomproject.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOjqXxmawZIxJ77c7up_7kn017dg">The Mom Project</a> have set for themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Most people don’t even know that a job in tech sales is even a possibility,” Shaan Hathiramani, the founder and chief executive of <a href="https://flockjay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flockjay.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiH_9zZ6mVEKgMhLTvdK9WrdIBhQ">Flockjay</a>, a company offering a tech sales training curriculum to the masses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOf7bi5jjiJLrOkcGuYQp33hCF8Q">said earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hathiramani said his startup could be an on-ramp to the tech industry for legions of workers who have the skill sets to work in tech, but lack the network to see themselves in the business. Just like coding bootcamps have enabled thousands to get jobs as programmers in the tech business, Flockjay helps talented people who had never considered a job in tech get into the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s a way for non-coders to leverage soft-skills they’d developed in other industries, including retail and food services, to jump into the higher paid world of tech companies. And it’s a way for those tech companies to find a more diverse pool of workers who can bring different skill sets and perspectives to the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A few hundred students have gone through the program so far, Hathiramani said, and the goal is to train 1,000 people over the course of 2021. The average income of a student before they go through Flockjay’s training program is $30,000 to $35,000 typically, Hathiramani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Upon graduation, those students can expect to make between $75,000 and $85,000, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s obvious that tech needs to “do better” on inclusion, and <a href="https://themomproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://themomproject.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjC2k05iqaMjKRiHI6bw0eWPFaXg">The Mom Project</a> — a Chicago startup that focuses on connecting women, including parents, with jobs from organizations specifically open to employing people who meet that profile — is one company tackling an aspect of the problem that’s become acute in the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sixty percent of the job losses in the pandemic have been women, and the statistics have been even worse for women of color,” said Mom Project chief executive Allison Robinson. “It’s like a canary in the coal mine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While The Mom Project doesn’t have any tools today to surface candidates that meet more diverse profiles on that front, Robinson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFLSGdurncK8F-ylnVAKW3BPmocw">told TechCrunch that they are considering it </a>and how to approach that in a way that works.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ultimately these are considerations that matter for companies of any size, according to Bain Capital Ventures managing director, Sarah Smith.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No matter what, it’s important that from day one [that] you have an eye on how to build an inclusive culture, where in an ideal world, even that first person you’re bringing onto the team could walk in and feel fairly welcomed. And&#8230; you really want people to bring their best selves and they bring their perspectives and their ideas,” <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunch/status/1377727469067907074">Smith told the audience at TechCrunch’s Early Stage Conference</a>. “I think it’s pretty common that a team might grow to like four or five from within the network, including the founders, [but] I think once you get to like number six, if you don’t have some type of gender or racial diversity yet… it’s gonna start to get really tough.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What we're looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though I'd thought that Robinhood would be the next such debut.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a big morning for fintech startups today: <a href="https://www.flywire.com/">Flywire</a>, a Boston-based magnet for venture capital, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521146481/d469729ds1.htm#toc469729_16">filed to go public</a>.</p>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company that attracted more than $300 million as a startup, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flywireco/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, most recently raising a $60 million Series F last month. We don&#8217;t have its most recent valuation, but <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company&#8217;s February 2020, $120 million round valued Flywire at $1 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>So what we&#8217;re looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though I&#8217;d thought that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">Robinhood</a> would be the next such debut.</p>
<p>Fintech venture capital activity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/optimism-reigns-at-consumer-trading-services-as-fintech-vc-spikes-and-robinhood-ipo-looms/">has been hot lately</a>, which makes the Flywire IPO interesting. Its success or failure could dictate the pace of fintech exits and fintech startup valuations in general, so we have to care about it.</p>

<hr />
<p>Regardless, we&#8217;re doing our regular work this morning. First, what does Flywire do and with whom does it compete? Then, a closer look at its financial results as we hope to get our hands around its revenue quality, aggregate economics and growth prospects.</p>
<p>After that, we&#8217;ll discuss valuations and which venture capital groups are set to do well in its flotation. The company had a number of backers, but Spark Capital, Temasek, F-Prime Capital and Bain Capital Ventures made the major shareholder list, along with Goldman Sachs. So, a number of firms and funds are hoping for a big Flywire exit. Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<h2>What is Flywire?</h2>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company. Or, as it states in its S-1 filing, it&#8217;s &#8220;a leading global payments enablement and software company.&#8221; And it thinks that its market, and by extension itself, has lots of room to grow. While &#8220;substantial strides [have been] made in payments technology in the retail and e-commerce industries,&#8221; the company wrote, &#8220;massive sectors of our global economy—including education, healthcare, travel, and business-to-business, or B2B, payments—are still in the early stages of digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the same logic behind Stripe&#8217;s epic valuation and the rising value of payments-focused companies like Finix.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One the same day as Fortnite maker <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/03/apple-vs-epic-live-updates/">Epic Games goes to trial</a> with one of the biggest legal challenges to the App Store&#8217;s business model to date, it has simultaneously <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/artstation-is-now-part-of-epic-games">announced</a> the acquisition of the artist portfolio community <a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/">ArtStation</a> &#8212; and immediately lowered the commissions on sales. Now standard creators on ArtStation will see the same 12% commission rate found in Epic&#8217;s own Games Store for PCs, instead of the 30% it was before. This reduced rate is meant to serve as an example to the wider community as to what a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; commission should look like. This could become a point of comparison with the Apple App Store&#8217;s 30% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">commission</a> for larger developers like Epic as the court case proceeds.</p>
<p>ArtStation today offers a place for creators across gaming, media and entertainment to showcase their work and find new jobs. The company has had a long relationship with Epic Games, as many ArtStation creators work with Epic&#8217;s Unreal Engine. However, ArtStation has also been a home to 2D and 3D creators across verticals, including those who don&#8217;t work with Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>The acquisition won&#8217;t change that, the team says in its <a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/">announcement</a>. Instead, the deal will expand the opportunities for creators to monetize their work. Most notably, that involves the commission drop. For standard creators, the fees will drop from 30% to 12%. For Pro members (who pay $9.95/mo for a subscription), the commission goes even lower &#8212; from 20% to 8%. And for self-promoted sales, the fees will be just 5%. ArtEngine&#8217;s streaming video service, ArtStation Learning, will also be free for the rest of 2021, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qyGwoFnOKF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/games-already-are-social-networks/">Games already are social networks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Games already are social networks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/games-already-are-social-networks/embed/#?secret=qyGwoFnOKF" data-secret="qyGwoFnOKF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The slashed commission, however, is perhaps the most important change Epic is making to ArtStation because it gives Epic a specific example as to how it treats its own creator communities. It will likely reference the acquisition and the commission changes during its trial with Apple, along with <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/about">its own Epic Games Store</a> and its similarly low rate. Already, Epic&#8217;s move had prompted Microsoft to lower its cut on game sales, too, having recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/microsoft-follows-epics-lead-lowers-its-cut-of-pc-game-sales-to-12/">announced</a> a similar 30% to 12% drop.</p>
<p>In the trial, Epic Games will try to argue that Apple has a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem and it abuses its market power to force developers to use Apple&#8217;s payment systems and pay it commissions on the sales and in-app purchases that flow through those systems. Epic Games, like several other larger app makers, would rather use its own payment systems to avoid the commission &#8212; or at the very least, be able to point users to a website where they can pay directly. But Apple doesn&#8217;t allow this, per its App Store guidelines.</p>
<p>Last year, Epic Games triggered Fortnite&#8217;s App Store expulsion by introducing a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">new direct way to pay on mobile devices, which offered a steep discount.</a> It was a calculated move. Both Apple and Google immediately banned the game for violating their respective app store policies, as a result. And then Epic sued.</p>
<p>While Epic&#8217;s fight is technically with both Apple and Google, it has focused more of its energy on the former because Android devices allow sideloading of apps (a means of installing apps directly), and Apple does not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s argument is that Epic Games agreed to Apple&#8217;s terms and guidelines and then purposefully violated them in an effort to get a special deal. But Apple says the guidelines apply to all developers equally, and Epic doesn&#8217;t get an exception here.</p>
<p>However, throughout the course of the U.S. antitrust investigations into big tech, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">discovered</a> that Apple did, in fact, make special deals in the past. Emails shared by the House Judiciary Committee as a part of an investigation revealed that Apple had agreed to a 15% commission for Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video app at the start, when typically subscription video apps are 30% in year one, then 15% in year two and beyond. (Apple says Amazon simply qualified for a new program.) Plus, other older emails revealed Apple had several discussions about raising commissions even higher than 30%, indicating that Apple believed its commission rate had some flex.</p>

<p>Ahead of today&#8217;s acquisition by Epic Games, ArtStation received a &#8220;Megagrant&#8221; from Epic during the height of the pandemic to help it through an uncertain period. This could may have pushed the two companies to further discuss deeper ties going forward.</p>
<p>“Over the last seven years, we&#8217;ve worked hard to enable creators to showcase their work, connect with opportunities and make a living doing what they love,” said Leonard Teo, CEO and co-founder of ArtStation, in a statement. “As part of Epic, we will be able to advance this mission and give back to the community in ways that we weren’t able to on our own, while retaining the ArtStation name and spirit.”</p>

<p><strong>JOCO</strong>, a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/citi-bike-rival-joco-brings-shared-docked-e-bikes-to-nyc/">docked e-bike service</a> in New York City, has launched and is already facing some headwinds. The service started with 300 e-bikes at 300 stations in private parking garages and plans to expand to about 1,000 e-bikes at 100 stations by June. That is, unless the NYC Department of Transportation has anything to say about it.</p>
<p>The city has exclusive rights with Citi Bike for docked bikeshares, which has somewhat stunted NYC&#8217;s shared micromobility growth. The city has sent JOCO a cease and desist letter. Assistant commissioner of the DOT, Michelle Craven, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been brought to our attention that [JOCO] commenced bicycle share operations in the City of New York. Please be advised that you do not have the authorization or permission, pursuant to a concession, franchise, permit, contract or otherwise, required for such operations. Additionally, the City of New York will actively enforce all laws and its police powers, including but not limited to those that protect its rights of way and ensure the safety and service provided by the city&#8217;s rights of way.</p>
<p>Accordingly, you are hereby directed immediately to cease and desist from any such bicycle share operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>JOCO&#8217;s lawyers maintain that the company is doing nothing illegal because it parks the bikes on private property, not city streets, like Citi Bike. The city did not respond to requests for more information about whether or not the DOT&#8217;s power extends to private property.</p>

<h3>A turning point for micromobility at scale?</h3>
<p>Within the past month, there&#8217;s been the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx, JOCO&#8217;s e-bike launch and now Lime&#8217;s decision to compete with Revel for the e-moped market. These moves suggest that New York is finally opening the doors to electric micromobility.</p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> announced the release of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lime-launches-100-e-mopeds-in-new-york-city-as-mayor-de-blasio-reveals-plan-to-fully-re-open-by-july-1/">100 electric mopeds in Brooklyn</a>, with planned expansions in Queens and lower Manhattan. A little competition will hopefully do the micromobility industry good, and that needs to happen if NYC is going to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Let&#8217;s not forget, making e-mobility the norm is absolutely essential to reducing carbon emissions in cities.</p>
<p>Another company is working on making it easier to scale up micromobility. <strong>Wunder Mobility</strong>, a company that sells software to shared mobility startups, has launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">new subsidiary called Wunder Capital</a>, which will help micromobility operators finance fleets. On top of that, the company has partnered with consumer micromobility vehicle manufacturer Yadea to refit its e-mopeds for sharing purposes. German shared e-moped company emmy is the first to publicly take advantage of all three Wunder Mobility offerings &#8212; the software, the loans and the Yadeas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the U.K., <strong>Wind</strong> has reported success in its e-scooter trial in Nottingham. Since the launch of the trial last October, city residents have taken more than 240,000 rides. According to Wind&#8217;s city manager in Nottingham, more than 100 users in the city download the Wind app every day, and there are rates of five to six daily rides on each scooter.</p>
<h3>Vaccine efforts</h3>
<p><strong>Superpedestrian</strong> has announced it will offer one million free rides on its LINK e-scooters to help citizens get to vaccination centers in communities in Italy and Spain. The company is giving away up to €10 million in free rides. The company said these rides will be made available in all European cities served by LINK scooters, including Rome, Madrid, Turin, Palermo, Málaga and Alcalá de Henares.</p>
<h3>Ready-to-outdoor e-bikes</h3>
<p><a href="https://retrospec.com/"><strong>Retrospec</strong></a>, the brand that makes fun toys like paddle boards, skateboards and bikes, is now adding electric bikes to the mix. There&#8217;s the Beaumont Rev City ($1,999.00) for swift city rides, the Beaumont Rev Step Through for an easy-to-mount swooped frame ($1,999.00) and the Jax Rev Folding e-bike ($1,399.99) with fat tires and good suspension so you can take it off road.</p>

<p>The march of consolidation continued this week with ride-hailing company <strong>Lyft</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">agreeing to sell its autonomous vehicle unit</a> to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million. The agreement shakes out with Woven Planet forking over $200 million in cash upfront, and then paying off the remaining $350 million over a five-year period. About 300 people from Lyft Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet. The Level 5 team, which in early 2020 numbered more than 400 people in the U.S., Munich and London, will continue to operate out of its office in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, officially ends Lyft&#8217;s nearly four-year effort to develop its own self-driving system.</p>

<p>In the 24 hours or so after this deal was reported I received a number of texts and DMs from folks in the industry — investors and AV developers — all who said something like &#8220;wow, Lyft is giving this away,&#8221; or &#8220;this is a steal.&#8221; It reminded me of comments I received after Uber sold off its own self-driving subsidiary to Aurora.</p>
<p>Lyft is also making some structural organizational changes to reflect this renewed focus. The company said it will retain its team of engineers, product managers, data scientists and UX designers that have been working on the consumer experience of hailing and then riding in an autonomous vehicle, which will be headed up by Jody Kelman. This team, now known as Lyft Autonomous, will be folded into the company&#8217;s fleet division that manages more than 10,000 vehicles via its rental and express drive programs. Lyft Fleet, which was founded in 2019 and is led by Cal Lankton, is also the group spearheading the company&#8217;s transition to 100% electric vehicles on the network by 2030. The idea is to bring all of these efforts &#8212; shared, electric and self-driving &#8212; under one roof.</p>
<p>So, who is left in the AV developer industry? Not many. There are the big well-capitalized players like Aurora, Argo AI, Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox, then a smattering of other startups and companies pursuing self-driving trucks, logistics and delivery. Who do you think is going to get gobbled up next?</p>
<p>On a side note: The Autonocast, which is the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, just taped an episode discussing the sale. We brought on Lyft co-founder and CEO John Zimmer to learn more on the why and what&#8217;s next. Stay tuned for the episode to drop this week.</p>

<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>EasyMile</strong>, a Toulouse, France-based autonomous vehicle company that builds shuttles for transporting both people and goods <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/easymile-raises-66m-for-its-autonomous-people-and-goods-shuttles/">closed a Series B round of €55 million ($66 million)</a> led by Searchlight Capital Partners. McWin and NextStage AM along with previous investors rail industry heavyweight Alstom, Bpifrance and auto giant Continental also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Hello</strong>, the Ant Financial-backed Chinese e-bike-sharing company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841944/000104746921001022/a2243152zf-1.htm">filed for an IPO</a>. The company, which has raised more than $3 billion, plans to list on the Nasdaq. A few interesting items from its S-1, including the company reported $926.3 million in revenue in 2020, a 25% increase from the previous year. Hello is not yet profitable, however. The company reported a net loss of $173.7 million in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>IRP Systems</strong>, a maker of powertrains for electric vehicles, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/israels-electric-powertrain-maker-irp-systems-raises-a-31m-series-c-funding/">$31 million Series C funding round</a>, bringing its total funding to $57 million. The financing was led by Clal Insurance and Altshuler Shaham, which are Israeli institutional investors. Also participating was Samsung Ventures, Renault-Nissan importer Carasso Motors and Shlomo Group, as well as existing investors such as Entrée Capital, Fosun RZ Capital and JAL Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Manna</strong>, the Irish drone startup planning to launch delivery services in the U.K. and U.S., raised $25 million from Draper Esprit, Team Europe, the venture capital firm of Delivery Hero founder Lukasz Gadowski and DST Global. The founders of online payments group Stripe also backed the group as private investors, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cea2c993-b166-48f2-89a6-2caa914af785">Financial Times reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, the self-driving truck startup, is in talks to merge with special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/self-driving-truck-startup-plus-said-to-plan-hennessy-spac-deal?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal would reportedly put the valuation of Plus at more than $3 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Zomato,</strong> the Indian food delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-files-for-an-ipo/">filed for an initial public offering</a>. The company,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> which counts Info Edge and Ant Group among its largest investors, plans to raise $1.1 billion from the IPO (about $1 billion from issuing new shares), according to the filing. The startup intends to list on Indian stock exchanges NSE and BSE. Zomato has been on a tear and is now operating in 24 markets. It&#8217;s also raised </span>more than $2.2 billion (according to research firm Tracxn), and was valued at $5.4 billion in its most recent fundraise round. The company said it may consider raising an additional $200 million ahead of public listing.</p>
<h2>Policy corner!</h2>

<p>It was a busy week in Washington. First up: Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Illinois) <a href="https://rush.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rush-introduces-legislation-to-slash-transportation-emissions-promote">introduced legislation</a> that calls for earmarking more than $7 billion each year in grants and rebates to scale up America&#8217;s electric vehicle charging network and accelerate domestic manufacturing of EVs. Rep. Rush introduced a similar bill last year that didn&#8217;t end up going anywhere, but with President Biden&#8217;s recent push for big spending on green infrastructure, we may see a different result this time around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Senate Democrat sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency calling for stricter policies on greenhouse gas emissions that exceed those outlined in Biden&#8217;s climate plan. The letter, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-technology-environment-and-nature-business-government-and-politics-aac3d6f02d62d1129ede461801e6c7b3">which was obtained by the Associated Press</a>, says the EPA should introduce incrementally tighter fuel economy standards until 2035, at which point there would be a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the U.S. does not establish a robust policy that leads to zero emission vehicle deployment, combined with appropriate incentives, we will be at risk of losing our automotive jobs and industry leadership to other nations, as well as enduring unnecessary public health impacts from pollution,&#8221; the AP reported Sen. Tom Carper (D-Delaware) wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Notice Carper&#8217;s invocation of jobs? He&#8217;s not the only one that&#8217;s arguing for (or against) a speedy transition on the basis of how it will affect workers. At a recent hearing at the <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/4/driving-innovation-the-future-of-automotive-mobility-safety-and-technology">U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a>, a representative from the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association told lawmakers that a fully electric vehicle fleet could put at risk up to 30% of the auto supplier industry&#8217;s workforce.</p>
<p>Biden, of course, has said that the shift to EVs will not cost Americans jobs &#8212; but that&#8217;s hard to see how that&#8217;s the case without his plan passing. Bosch executives told me recently that only one employee is needed to manufacture an electric powertrain system, versus 10 for a diesel powertrain. Although Bosch is referring to operations in Europe, it&#8217;s an instructive example.</p>

<p>Welp, lots happened. Shall we attempt to squeeze it all in? OK, let&#8217;s proceed.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong> revealed a four-part plan meant to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/gm-partners-with-7-charging-networks-ahead-of-new-electric-vehicles/">handle all the steps of charging an electric vehicle</a>, including finding a public charger and paying for the power, as the automaker seeks ways to attract customers to the 30 EVs it plans to launch by 2025. The Ultium Charge 360 plan &#8212; named after the underlying electric vehicle platform and batteries of its upcoming EVs &#8212; aims to handle the access, payment and customer service components of charging an electric vehicle at home and on the road. Importantly, GM has signed agreements with seven third-party charging network providers, including Blink Charging, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect.</p>
<p>This is more than just locking up partnerships though. If GM hopes to convert drivers to EVs it has to think about how to integrate real-time information about EV charging stations into the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. It appears the company is making an attempt at that though. Using their GM vehicle brand mobile app, EV drivers will be able to see real-time information, including location and whether a charger is being used, from nearly 60,000 charging plugs throughout the U.S. and Canada, the company said.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> reported <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22">first quarter earnings</a>. Tesla generated revenues of $10.389 billion, gross profit of $2.215 billion and net income of $438 million. The upshot: Regulatory credits and bitcoin combined with volume growth and some gross margin improvement buoyed results and helped offset additional supply chain costs, R&amp;D investments, the costs associated with changing over Model S and Model X and lower ASP (average selling price). Revenue jumped some 75% from the same period last year — certainly notable growth. Regulatory credits brought in $518 million and bitcoin made a $101 million &#8220;positive impact&#8221; to the company&#8217;s profitability in the first quarter, according to Tesla CFO and &#8220;master of coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn.</p>
<p>Tesla<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-sees-bitcoin-as-important-financial-tool-to-access-cash-quickly/"> invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a> this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%. The company believes in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility, Kirkhorn said during an earnings call. He noted that Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk.</p>
<p><strong>One more piece of Tesla news &#8230;</strong> CEO Elon Musk wants to turn every home into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/tesla-wants-to-make-every-home-a-distributed-power-plant/">distributed power plant</a> that would generate, store and even deliver energy back into the electricity grid, all using the company&#8217;s products, according to comments he made during last week&#8217;s earnings call.</p>

<p>While the company has been selling solar and energy storage products for years, a new company policy will only sell customers solar coupled with the energy storage products. In short: it&#8217;s a package deal only. Musk&#8217;s pitch is that the grid would need more power lines, more power plants and larger substations to fully decarbonize using renewables plus storage. Distributed residential systems &#8212; of course using Tesla products &#8212; would provide a better path, in Musk&#8217;s view.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen&#8217;s</strong> &#8220;Voltswagen&#8221; stunt is being investigated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/volkswagen-und-voltswagen-us-boersenaufsicht-prueftaprilscherz-a-9feeafe6-0002-0001-0000-000177330665">according to Der Spiegel</a>.</p>
<h2>Future of flight</h2>
<p><strong>Luminar Technologies</strong> said it is expanding its lidar business beyond automotive and into aviation through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/airbus-taps-luminar-to-test-how-lidar-could-be-used-to-make-flying-safer-and-autonomous/">partnership with Airbus</a>. Until now, Luminar has exclusively focused on applying its light detection and ranging radar to automated vehicles on the ground &#8212; not in the skies. The partnership won&#8217;t immediately bring lidar into commercial aircraft. Unlike Luminar&#8217;s deal with Daimler, Mobileye and Volvo this is not a production contract, although the aim is that it will lead to one. Instead, the partnership is with Airbus&#8217; UpNext subsidiary, which is focused on developing and eventually applying new technological breakthroughs to aviation.</p>
<p>The effort will be folded into Airbus Flightlab, an ecosystem that offers access to flight test platforms across Airbus&#8217; business lines, including commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense and space. Luminar and Airbus will develop and test how lidar can be used to enhance sensing, perception and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight, the companies said.</p>
<p><strong>Wingcopter</strong> launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/wingcopter-debuts-a-triple-drop-drone-to-create-logistical-highways-in-the-sky/">new autonomous delivery drone</a> designed to remove a technical bottleneck hindering the growth of drone transport services. The Wingcopter 198 is capable of making three separate deliveries per flight, the company said. Wingcopter has couched this multi-stop capability as a critical feature that will allow it to grow a cost-efficient &#8212; and hopefully profitable &#8212; drone-delivery-as-a-service business.</p>

<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> CEO Herbert Diess told <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/software-chips-solarenergie-die-autonome-bewegung-diess-verordnet-vw-nach-der-e-mobilitaet-schon-die-naechste-revolution/27144790.html?ticket=ST-3109182-GSYh26gMoOSNCApMR6P3-ap4">Handelsblatt</a> newspaper that the company plans to <a href="https://www.autonews.com/technology/vw-will-design-chips-autonomous-vehicles-ceo-says?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">design and develop its own chips</a> and software for autonomous vehicles. To be clear, VW doesn&#8217;t plan to manufacture these chips. Instead, it wants to own the patents and intends to have its software division Cariad develop the chips.</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p><strong>Revel</strong>, the company that made its name by planting dockless blue e-mopeds in Brooklyn and then expanded swiftly this year into monthly subscription e-bikes and a &#8220;Superhub&#8221; EV charging station, is now rounding out its strategy to own electrification in cities. Last week, Revel announced it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/">launching an all-Tesla, ride-hail service</a> in Manhattan below 42nd Street. To add a bit of drama to the launch, NYC&#8217;s Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission has come out with a statement saying the company has no right to operate a for-hire taxi service. The TLC has issued a cap on for-hire vehicles because supply exceeds demand, according to TLC Commissioner Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk. Revel says its actions are perfectly legal because its service falls under the electric battery exemption, which Jarmoszuk says &#8220;exists to encourage already-licensed cars to go green, not to flood an already saturated market or to disenfranchise the Yellow Taxi sector in Manhattan.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Stellantis</strong> has a short-term vehicle service called Free2Move that is <a href="https://www.free2move.com/en-US/press/press-release-2021-04-29">expanding into the United States</a>. The car on-demand subscription service will first launch in Los Angeles before opening in five other American markets by the end of the year. The service has been deployed in several European countries since 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> is launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/uber-adds-vaccine-booking-car-rental-delivery-in-new-product-push/">more than a half-dozen new features</a>, including one that will let users book vaccine appointments at Walgreens and reserve a ride to get their jab, as the company homes in on a business model that will finally deliver profitability. The features fall under what Uber is describing as its &#8220;go get&#8221; strategy and is meant to mark a return to more &#8220;normal&#8221; business operations following 14 months of shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The numerous features that include vaccine booking, a valet service that will drop off a rental car, reserved rides at airports that offer up to an hour of wait time and options to pick up food during a ride-hailed route are all centered around Uber&#8217;s core services of delivery and ride hailing. Side note: Earnings alert! We will be listening in May 5.</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Education may well be the most important activity we conduct as a society — and it may also be the hardest space to build a startup in. Selling to school districts and universities is notoriously difficult, but enticing consumers is even harder. Learning takes focus, patience, tenacity and resources, and most consumers would prefer to watch some lip-sync videos on TikTok than stare at math equations (not to mention that such entertainment is free). Engagement and education feel aggressively at odds, which limits the way that startups can scale and succeed.</p>
<p>Yet, the revulsion VCs have traditionally had for the space has slowly dissipated over the past 10 years. Consumer and enterprise startups in edtech are increasingly attracting funding, and there is a growing crop of edtech-focused investors who are betting big on the future here. What’s changed isn’t the market or its potential, but rather the perception that ambitious and sustainable companies can truly be built in education.</p>
<p>One of the companies that has led the charge in transforming those perceptions is Pittsburgh-based <b>Duolingo</b>. It’s a language-learning app that has caught fire. From humble origins a decade ago as a translation platform for news agencies, it’s now used by 500 million people across the world to learn Spanish, English, French and more, all while generating bookings of $190 million in 2020. It’s a smashing success, but a success that was hard earned after a years-long effort of product and revenue experimentation to find its current niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luis von Ahn, an entrepreneur who has dedicated his career to scaling free education, has probably annoyed you more than once. In fact, you’ve likely been annoyed by his work dozens and maybe hundreds of times over the years.</p>
<p>A decade before he co-founded the whimsical and language-learning app <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, one of the most popular education apps in the world with over 500 million downloads and 40 million active users, he was building the technology that would become CAPTCHA, those human-annoying but bot-preventing little tests that pop up when registering or logging in to popular internet services like email.</p>
<p>It may seem like a radical pivot, but in fact, the lessons of how to create useful security tests at scale for consumers would one day offer the core DNA for building one of the most successful edtech companies in the world. The immigrant entrepreneur would soon learn himself that crowdsourcing, language and a willingness to adapt and ignore critics could change the face of an industry forever.</p>
<h2>CAPTCHA’ing a market</h2>
<p>Von Ahn grew up in Guatemala City, where he saw firsthand the wretched state of public schools in impoverished countries. His mother spent most of her income sending him to “fancy private school” as he puts it, and he estimates she spent over $1 million on his education over his lifetime. The price tag weighed on him, and he knew he wanted to broaden access to education in the future.</p>
<p>After attending Duke as an undergrad, von Ahn was an enterprising first-year computer science Ph.D. student at top-ranked Carnegie Mellon University when he attended a talk by Yahoo’s chief scientist about 10 of Yahoo&#8217;s biggest headaches. One issue stood out: hackers were creating bots that register thousands of email addresses to send spam.</p>
<p>Inspired and full of immigrant grit, von Ahn and a team led by his then-adviser Manuel Blum created a nifty little test that could distinguish between bots and humans. The test, called a CAPTCHA, presented squiggly, ink-blotted words whenever a user tried to log in. Computer vision at the time couldn’t read the obscured text, but humans easily could — creating a useful signal. The deceptively simple test worked, so von Ahn, then a 20-something student, gave it to Yahoo for free, not understanding the value it would one day have.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146593" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146593" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146593 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Luis-von-Ahn_04.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146593" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn, the inventor of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, and co-founder of Duolingo. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>A fire was lit. With Yahoo as a distribution channel, CAPTCHA tests exploded in popularity, becoming an almost universally recognizable security checkpoint feature. At their peak, people spent 500,000 hours a day typing up to 200 million CAPTCHAs around the world. About 10% of the world’s population had recognized at least one word, von Ahn estimates.</p>
<p>For all the technology’s success, though, there was a downside. “During those 10 seconds while you’re typing in a CAPTCHA, your brain is doing something that computers can’t do, which is amazing,” von Ahn said. But the tests were annoying and pointless, so he wondered, “Could we get those 500,000 hours a day to do something useful for humanity?”</p>
<p>So in 2005, he launched reCAPTCHA. These new tests would have the same goal of CAPTCHA, but with a twist: the prompts would all be scans of books. Users would complete the security test while also helping to digitize books for the Internet Archive.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146595" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146595" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2146595 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg" alt="" width="862" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5320863feab8ea5710f972ca.jpeg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146595" class="wp-caption-text">The early design of reCAPTCHA.<strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>This time, von Ahn knew his nifty idea was worth something. In 2009, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/16/google-acquires-recaptcha-to-power-scanning-for-google-books-and-google-news/">sold reCAPTCHA to Google</a>, a transaction conducted just a year after the internet giant had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7395751.stm">purchased a license to one of his other research projects</a>, a game focused on image labeling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146594" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146594" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146594 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/43065920_10160965239955068_2421866757531631616_n.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146594" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn presenting about reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA, two of his iconic inventions. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>The acquisition offered not just a monetary award (exact terms of the deal were not disclosed), but also suddenly garnered von Ahn serious clout in the industry just a few years after acquiring his Ph.D. Yet, instead of taking up tenure at the tech company, he stayed local in Pittsburgh and became a computer science professor at his alma mater.</p>
<p>Entering the world of education as a professor felt like an answer to his original dream of expanding access to education. What von Ahn didn’t know, though, was that his iconic work was simply foreshadowing. Carnegie Mellon, crowdsourced translation and even Google would all play a role in his next project as well, albeit in wildly different ways: incubation, failure and investment. For him, the success of two tools that used language as a barrier was the beginning of a long journey into discovering if, and how, language could instead be a bridge. It was an insight that would grow into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/">a startup valued at $2.4 billion</a> with the goal of making language learning fun: Duolingo.</p>
<h2>Duolingo’s first words</h2>
<p>In 2011, edtech startups such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> were popping up — companies that today are valued as multibillion-dollar businesses. The rise of iPads and tablets in classrooms gave permission to founders who believed the future of education was on the internet. Enthusiasm was boiling, and virtual instruction felt like a nascent, but ambitious, place to bet on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn was tired of the gray and dreary design aesthetic edtech companies used to emulate universities. Instead, he and the company’s early team sought inspiration from games like Angry Birds and Clash Royale, looking to build a class that screamed more cartoon anarchy than lecture hall. From that frenetic creativity came the company’s distinctive mascot: a childish and rebellious evergreen-colored owl named Duo.</p>
<p>Duolingo didn’t just throw out the old colors though — it wanted to completely rethink language learning from the bottom up for mobile. So it replaced top-down curriculums with analytics-driven growth strategies, becoming consumed by an ethos that has more recently been dubbed product-led growth.</p>
<p>Used by companies such as Calendly, Slack and Dropbox, product-led growth is a strategy in which a company iterates its product to create loyal fans-turned-customers who popularize the product with others, creating a viral growth loop. It’s an attractive route because it vastly lowers the cost of acquiring users while also increasing engagement and thus retention. Duolingo, for example, has taken this model and found ways to embed engagement hooks, pockets of joy and addictive education features within its core app.</p>
<p>With early venture capital in its pocket, Duolingo could afford to focus on product over profits.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">In part one of this EC-1</a>, we explored how von Ahn’s previous products around CAPTCHA led to Duolingo’s launch, the rise and fall of crowdsourced translation as a way to disrupt language learning, and the accidental iteration of a top education app by a pair of interns. The startups’ early signs of success gave it energy to focus on growth to accomplish two things: know what they’re doing works, and garner a lot of user data so it continued iterating the product into something that was ever more addicting to use.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll analyze how Duolingo used product-led growth as a lever to expand its consumer base, and how a company built on gamification tries to balance its whimsy with education outcomes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146587" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146587" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Duolingo_PressKit_DuoHop_900.gif" alt="" width="602" height="567" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146587" class="wp-caption-text">Duo, Duolingo&#8217;s mascot, flying around. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<h2>From Angry Birds to an amusing and sometimes scowling owl</h2>
<p>Tyler Murphy, having graduated from his intern position at Duolingo launching the company’s iOS app, noticed that the gaming world was rapidly innovating around him in the mid-2010s. Angry Birds was no longer the only popular game on mobile, and video games generally were getting more engaging, with in-app currencies, progress bars and an experience that felt creatively addictive. He suddenly saw connections between the entertainment that games provided and the patient learning required for languages.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be cool if the skill got harder and harder, kind of like how a character in a game gets more powerful and powerful?” he remembers asking. Duolingo had taken early inspiration from Angry Birds as well as Clash Royale later, following that game’s launch in 2016. “Half the people at Duolingo were playing Clash Royale, at some point,” he said. “And I think that shaped our product roadmap a lot and our design language a lot.”</p>
<p>Games solved a problem that was acutely personal for Murphy. The employee, who would go on to become chief designer at Duolingo, had gone to college to teach Spanish to students, but ultimately left the field after struggling to inspire kids in a classroom setting. The realization that Duolingo could borrow from gaming instead of monotonous edtech companies gave an adrenaline rush — and permission — to the team to experiment with new approaches to learning.</p>
<p>Every game needs some form of experience points and leveling up, and for Duolingo learners, that progress comes in the form of skill trees.</p>
<p>These trees, which were conceived by a design agency during the company’s early development, are Duolingo’s core experience, a visual representation of language skills that are interconnected and get progressively more difficult and refined over time. Each skill is a prerequisite for another. Sometimes it’s just logic: in order to be able to speak about restaurants, you probably should be able to introduce yourself first. Sometimes, however, it’s a necessary building block: in order to speak about your routine, you should be able to speak about basic everyday activities.</p>
<p>In Duolingo, each unit has its own suite of skills, each of which is broken down into five lessons. Once you complete all five lessons, you can move to the next skill. Complete all skills and you can move to the next unit. Depending on the language, a user might encounter an average of 60 skills across nine different units within a course.</p>

<h2>The growth power of a cartoon owl meme</h2>
<p>Duolingo had its “leveling up” model figured out, but now it had to integrate gamification into every nook and cranny of its app. One of its first challenges was rebuilding the sort of teacher-student emotional bond that can help students stay motivated to learn. No one likes to fail, and Duolingo stumbled upon a scalable approach through its cartoon owl mascot Duo &#8212; also thought of by the design agency behind the skill trees.</p>
<p>Whenever users succeed or fail at their lessons today, they are likely to be encouraged or admonished by Duo’s presence. Designers sprinkled Duo throughout the product, looking at Super Mario Brothers as an example of how to use iconic art to create a friendly gaming experience. In early iterations of the app, Duo was present but static, more of an icon than a personality. That changed as the company increasingly pushed harder on engagement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As its meandering route to monetization will demonstrate, Duolingo isn’t mission-oriented, it’s mission-obsessed.</p>
<p>Co-founders Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker never wanted to charge consumers for access to Duolingo content, a purpose imbued throughout the company’s culture. For years in order to work at Duolingo, you had to be comfortable with joining a company in Pittsburgh that was in no rush to make money. The startup, filled with education enthusiasts and mission-driven employees, became “very college pizza vibes,” Gina Gotthilf, former VP of Marketing at Duolingo, described. Everyone was against making money and having structure — some employees even threatened to quit if Duolingo ever charged a cent to users.</p>
<p>“One thing that recruited me was this brilliance that we can kill two birds with one stone,” she said, referring to Duolingo’s original translation-service business model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">we talked about in part one of this EC-1</a>. “It was obviously tied to Luis’ thinking and reCAPTCHA and it was magical and brilliant.”</p>
<p>Free may not have paid the bills, but it did come with a valuable upside: growth. By 2017, Duolingo would boast having 200 million users, which was double von Ahn’s goal when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/recaptcha-founders-language-learning-site-duolingo-to-open-to-the-public-on-june-19/">he first launched to the public on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage</a>.</p>
<p>Duolingo launched saying it would never do advertisements, subscriptions or in-app purchases — approaches that now all exist on the platform. Today, Duolingo has a simple freemium business model that is remarkably unconventional. It has a free version with all of its learning content, and it charges a subscription of $6.99 per month for paywalled features such as unlimited hearts, no advertisements and progress tracking. It also has a number of other revenue streams it’s developing, such as language proficiency tests.</p>
<p>As we’ll explore, Duolingo’s route from anti-business rebel to conventional consumer subscription is complex, full of twists and turns. While Duolingo never wanted to look like other edtech companies, as we saw with its product strategy in part two, it turns out that evolving from college pizza vibes meant that it would have to take a page from its peers.</p>

<h2>Business only speaks one language: Money</h2>
<p>“They had users and in Silicon Valley, there was this notion that if you have users, you can turn anything into money,” said Bing Gordon, the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB) partner who led Duolingo’s $20 million Series C in 2014.</p>
<p>“This was not very controversial back then, at least with investors,” von Ahn said. “This became controversial for us once we raised a ton of money, and we still weren’t making more money.”</p>
<p>While the company’s investors were relatively lenient in the early years, patience was starting to run thin. In June 2015, Duolingo raised a $45 million Series D round led by Laela Sturdy of Google Capital (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/04/google-capital-changes-its-name-to-capitalg/">later rebranded CapitalG</a>), valuing the company at $470 million. She invested because of Duolingo’s growth and engagement numbers, but confronted von Ahn with some direct advice.</p>
<p>“She said to me, ‘Look, it worked for you to continue getting bigger and bigger checks from venture capital,’” von Ahn said. “‘But this is the last time it works for you … if you’re trying to con people, you cannot con anybody bigger than us [at Google].’” Duolingo’s valuation wouldn’t just be at stake next time it went fundraising on Sand Hill Road — its very survival would be as well.</p>
<p>Looking back, Sturdy said that she always “had confidence that they would come up with a revenue model” because of Duolingo’s passionate and organic users.</p>
<p>When a startup chooses to raise venture capital, it sets itself on a heavily-prescribed course. Suddenly, success isn’t defined merely as cash-flow breakeven with a long-term sustainable business. It has to be an exit of some sorts, and a big one at that. While Duolingo used venture as a lifeline to fund its product development, venture also came with pressure to become a billion-dollar company, or more. And that meant making revenue, not just growing engagement.</p>
<p>Von Ahn says his conversation with Sturdy is what really changed his mindset about money. After the Google check hit Duolingo’s bank account, he and Hacker began thinking about ways to make Duolingo as much a monetary success as it had been an educational one.</p>

<h2>Dr. Ahn or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the revenue(s)</h2>
<p>“It was clear that Luis didn’t have commercial instincts, he had cultural instincts and a deep focus on learning,” said Gordon. “[When we invested] Duolingo predicted it was on the verge of revenue growth, and it turned out it was not on the verge of revenue growth.”</p>
<p>What Gordon is alluding to was a litany of monetization attempts in Duolingo’s past. Translation, which helped von Ahn’s previous two startups, didn’t work when applied to language-learning services, and the company only secured two customers before ending the service. Business partnerships, such as a relationship with Uber to certify and train drivers in Brazil to speak English, didn’t catch fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Duolingo has been wildly successful. It has pulled in 500 million total registered learners, 40 million active users, 1.5 million premium subscribers and $190 million in booked revenues in 2020. It has a popular and meme-ified mascot in the form of the owl Duo, a creative and engaging product, and ambitious plans for expansion.There’s just one key question in the midst of all those milestones: Does anyone actually learn a language using Duolingo?</p>
<p>“Language is first and foremost a social, relational phenomenon,” said Sébastien Dubreil, a teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “It is something that allows people to make meaning and talk to each other and conduct the business of living — and when you do this, you use a tone of different kinds of resources that are not packaged in the vocabulary and grammar.”</p>
<p>Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn estimates that Duolingo’s upcoming product developments will get users from zero to a knowledge job in a different language within the next two to three years. But for now, he is honest about the limits of the platform today.</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t say that with Duolingo, you can start from zero and make your English as good as mine,” he said. “That&#8217;s not true. But that&#8217;s also not true with learning a language in a university, that’s not true with buying books, that&#8217;s not true with any other app.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146603" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146603" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2146603 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=768,766 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/White-House-Visit-2015.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146603" class="wp-caption-text">Luis von Ahn, the co-founder of Duolingo, visiting President Obama in 2015. <strong> Image Credits: </strong>Duolingo</p></div></p>
<p>While Dubreil doesn’t think Duolingo can teach someone to speak a language, he does think it has taught consistency — a hard nut to crack in edtech. “What Duolingo does is to potentially entice students to do things you cannot pay them enough time to actually do, which is to spend time in that textbook and reinforce vocabulary and the grammar,” he said.</p>
<p>That’s been the key focus for the company since the beginning. “I said this when we started Duolingo and I still really strongly believe it: The hardest thing about learning a language is staying motivated,” von Ahn said, comparing it to how people approach exercise: it’s hard to stay motivated, but a little motion a day goes a long way.</p>
<p>With an enviable lead in its category, Duolingo wants to bring the quality and effectiveness of its curriculum on par with the quality of its product and branding. With growth and monetization secured, Duolingo is no longer in survival mode. Instead, it’s in study mode.</p>
<p>In this final part, we will explore how Duolingo is using a variety of strategies, from rewriting its courses to what it dubs Operation Birdbrain, to become a more effective learning tool, all while balancing the need to keep the growth and monetization engines stoked while en route to an IPO.</p>

<h2>“Just a funny game that is maybe not as bad as Candy Crush.”</h2>
<p>Duolingo’s competitors see the app’s massive gamification and solitary experience as inherently contradictory with high-quality language education. <a href="https://www.busuu.com/">Busuu</a> and <a href="https://www.babbel.com/">Babbel</a>, two subscription-based competitors in the market, both focus on users talking in real time to native speakers.</p>
<p>Bernhard Niesner, the co-founder and CEO of Busuu, which was founded in 2008, sees Duolingo as an entry-level tool that can help users migrate to its human-interactive service. “If you want to be fluent, Duolingo needs innovation,” Niesner said. “And that’s where we come in: We all believe that you should not be learning a language just by yourself, but [ … ] together, which is our vision.” Busuu has more than 90 million users worldwide.</p>
<p>Duolingo has been the subject of a number of efficacy studies over the years. One of its most positive reports, from <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/how-well-does-duolingo-work/#:~:text=How%20long%20did%20it%20take,per%20week%20for%2015%20weeks).">September 2020</a>, showed that its Spanish and French courses teach the equivalent of four U.S. university semesters in half the time.</p>
<p>Babbel, which has sold over<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/language-learning-service-babbel-says-it-has-now-sold-over-10m-subscriptions/"> 10 million subscriptions</a> to its language-learning service, cast doubt on the power of these findings. Christian Hillemeyer, who heads PR for the startup, pointed out that Duolingo only tested for reading and writing efficacy — not for speaking proficiency, even though that is a key part of language learning. He described Duolingo as “just a funny game that is maybe not as bad as Candy Crush.”</p>

<h2>Putting the ed back into edtech</h2>
<p>One of the ironic legacies of Duolingo’s evolution is that for years it outsourced much of the creation of its education curriculum to volunteers. It’s a legacy the company is still trying to rectify.</p>
<p>The year after its founding, Duolingo <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/15/tech/mobile/duolingo-incubator-language-teaching">launched its Language Incubator</a> in 2013. Similar to its original translation service, the company wanted to leverage crowdsourcing to invent and refine new language courses. Volunteers — at least at first — were seen as a scrappy way to bring new material to the growing Duolingo community and more than 1,000 volunteers have helped bring new language courses to the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Verizon&#8217;s long-anticipated sale of its media business now finally in progress &#8212; by way of a deal, announced earlier today, with private equity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo paying $5 billion</a> for Yahoo, AOL and the many various internet brands and services that are part of the operation (including us, TechCrunch) &#8212; the next very likely question is, what comes next?</p>
<p>Hans Vestberg, the CEO of Verizon, laid out a taste of what is to come: commerce, content and betting.</p>
<p>In an internal memo to employees, Vestberg said that Apollo&#8217;s &#8220;powerful vision&#8221; will be not just playing on revenue-generating businesses that have been grown out as a part of Verizon Media, but leveraging that to work with other assets that Apollo has in its portfolio, which include a pretty wide range of companies in the TMT sector such as Rackspace and Charter Communications, as well as a ton of other kinds of companies across retail, financial services, industrial and manufacturing, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That could involve more advertising or sales customers &#8212; Claire&#8217;s, the accessories chain, is also in the Apollo mix &#8212; or something else altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made Apollo’s offer so appealing, is that it includes leveraging the entire Verizon Media ecosystem of adtech, affiliate relationships, data, insights, targeting and reach,&#8221; Vestberg said.</p>
<p>You can read a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigger analysis of the deal here</a>. The full memo is below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">V Team,</p>
<p>Moments ago we made an important announcement. We’ve entered into an agreement with a leading global investment manager, Apollo, to acquire Verizon Media. While this is a bittersweet moment, Verizon will maintain a minority stake in the new company, which upon deal closing will be called Yahoo.</p>
<p>This is a big step forward for our Media team. A team that delivered an incredible turnaround these past 2.5 years &#8211; capped off by the last 2 quarters of double digit growth. This move will help accelerate that growth.</p>
<p>After a strategic review, Guru and I discussed, and believed, that the full value of Media’s offerings have yet to be unlocked. Apollo has a powerful vision that includes aggressively pursuing growth areas in commerce, content and betting. One that also features synergies with many of the traditional brick and mortar companies in their portfolio who can benefit from Media’s e-commerce platform. What made Apollo’s offer so appealing, is that it includes leveraging the entire Verizon Media ecosystem of adtech, affiliate relationships, data, insights, targeting and reach.</p>
<p>I believe this move is right for all of our stakeholders including the Media employees. Our purpose is to create the networks that move the world forward, and this will help us better focus all our energy and resources on our core competencies.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be more proud of the work that Guru, his leadership team, and the entire Media team of “Builders” has done to get to this point. In fact, it’s important to note that Guru will continue in his current leadership role.</p>
<p>As a reminder, as with any deal like this, the transition will take time to complete. It’s important that we continue to stay focused on our ongoing work together, across all our business units and continue to deliver the best customer experiences we are known for.</p>
<p>This is but one more chapter in an iconic and storied brand. I am excited about where they will take the new Yahoo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building and sustaining a startup is as challenging as it is fulfilling. Doing it during a global pandemic takes unprecedented (oy, there’s that word again) ingenuity, support and expert insight. You’ll find all of that and more at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.</p>
<p><strong>A shut-the-front-door moment:</strong> Want to access all the expert advice, networking, community connection and potential growth opportunities for less than $100? Heck yeah. You have just two left weeks to score the super early-bird price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your pass to Disrupt 2021</a> before the deadline expires on <strong>May 13, 11:59 pm (PST)</strong>.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt</a> features one-on-one interviews, presentations and breakout sessions with tech titans, fascinating founders, top-tier VCs and countless other subject-matter experts spanning the tech ecosystem. We’re building a righteous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">roster of speakers</a>, and we’ll be announcing them in the coming weeks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s one example we can share today. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/discover-how-duolingo-started-with-ceo-luis-von-ahn-at-disrupt-2021/">Luis von Ahn</a> co-founded Duolingo, a gamified language-learning app used by hundreds of millions around the world. And get this — von Ahn debuted Duolingo on the Disrupt stage nine years ago. He might have a few helpful hints, amirite?</p>
<p>Show of hands — who can’t wait for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a>? If you think you have what it takes to win this famously epic global pitch competition, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply right here</a>. Take your shot and you might just walk away with $100,000. Every competing team benefits from intense media and investor exposure. Not ready to throw down? That’s cool — you can learn a lot just by watching the pitches and hearing the questions posed by leading VC judges.</p>
<p>Speaking of Startup Battlefield judges. So far, we’ve tapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/sydney-thomas-is-coming-to-judge-startups-at-disrupt/">Sydney Thomas</a> (Precursor Ventures), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/alexa-von-tobel-will-join-disrupt-2021-as-a-startup-battlefield-judge/">Alexa von Tobel</a> (Inspired Capital) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/gv-partner-terri-burns-is-joining-us-to-judge-the-startup-battlefield/">Terri Burns</a> (GV) — with more to come. These folks know their stuff, so get ready to impress the best.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about Startup Alley. We’ve supercharged the exposure opportunities for exhibitors in our virtual expo, including a chance to participate in Startup Alley+ — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">read about the new Startup Alley benefits</a> and opportunities.

<p>Why should you attend Disrupt? Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, tells us why she keeps coming back.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love Disrupt because it features incredible companies. My work exposes me to lots of companies all over the world but, inevitably, I run across startups at Disrupt I haven&#8217;t heard of yet. It&#8217;s always fascinating to explore opportunities and find ways to work together.</p></blockquote>

Come find the inspiration, opportunities and expert information you need to drive your business forward.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning was a notable one in the life of TechCrunch the publication, as our parent company&#8217;s parent company <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">decided to sell</a> our parent company to a different parent company. And now we&#8217;re going to have to get new corporate IDs, again, as it appears that our new parent company&#8217;s parent company wants to rebrand our parent company. As Yahoo.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, a bunch of other stuff happened as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flywire, a Boston-based payments company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521146481/d469729ds1.htm">filed to go public</a>. More on the site about this shortly.</li>
<li>Earnings this week are coming from Uber and Lyft and PayPal and Square and more.</li>
<li>Dell is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/dell-dumps-another-big-asset-moving-boomi-to-francisco-partners-and-tpg-for-4b/">offloading Boomi</a> to private equity as it wants to de-lever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">Again</a>.</li>
<li>Cloud market share numbers <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-Q121">are out</a>, but what matters is that the growth of the cloud market helps explain the growth that we&#8217;re seeing in the startup game. (Our own Ron Miller dug into some rival cloud metrics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/cloud-infrastructure-market-keeps-rolling-in-q1-with-almost-40b-in-revenue/">here</a>.)</li>
<li>The Chinese government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/china-says-33-apps-break-rules-in-gathering-personal-information">crackdown</a> on its tech giants continues. And <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-halves-its-ant-group-valuation-after-beijings-clampdown-11620036004">it&#8217;s impacting valuations</a>.</li>
<li>And Wealthsimple raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/wealthsimple-raises-610m-at-a-4b-valuation/">an epic CAD$750 million round</a>, while Ohio-based Path Robotics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/path-robotics-raises-56m-series-b-for-automated-welding/">just raised a $56 million Series B</a>. Super cool.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse, the voice-based networking app that&#8217;s now being knocked off by every major tech platform, is bringing its service to Android. The company announced during its weekly townhall event that its Android version has entered beta testing with a handful of non-employees who will provide the company with early feedback ahead of a public launch.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Release-Notes-acfb2f5d56cf4718b6486f5f670db6ad">release notes</a>, Clubhouse referred to this test as involving a &#8220;rough beta version&#8221; that&#8217;s in the process of being rolled out to a group of &#8220;friendly testers.&#8221; That means there&#8217;s not a way for the broader public to sign up for the Android app just yet.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android client combined with its invite system initially gave Clubhouse an aura of exclusivity. You had to know someone to get in, and then you would need an iOS device to participate. But the delay to provide access to Android users also gave larger competitors time to catch up with Clubhouse and court users who were being left behind. One of the largest of the rivals, Facebook, recently challenged Clubhouse across all its platforms and services, in fact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">a full audio strategy</a> that included a range of new products, from short-form audio snippets to a direct Clubhouse clone that works across Facebook and Messenger. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/">announced</a> a way for Instagram Live users to turn off their video and mute their mics, similar to Clubhouse. Even Facebook&#8217;s R&amp;D division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">tested a Clubhouse alternative, Hotline</a>, which offers a sort of mashup between the popular audio app and Instagram Live, with more of a Q&amp;A focus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter is continuing to expand its audio rooms feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">Twitter Spaces</a>, and there are Clubhouse alternatives from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/spotify-ceo-says-live-audio-content-is-the-next-stories/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/19/telegram-voice-features-ios-update/">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">others</a>, in the works, too.</p>
<p>For Clubhouse, that means the time has come to push for growth &#8212; especially as there are already some signs its initial hype is wearing off. According to app store intelligence firm Apptopia, Clubhouse has seen an estimated 13.5 million downloads on iOS to date, but the number of daily downloads has been falling, mirroring a decline in the number of daily active users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="126" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=150,28 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=300,56 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=768,142 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=680,126 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=1536,284 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HbpIl78Q.jpg?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146751" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apptopia</p></div></p>
<p>Apptopia&#8217;s data shows that Clubhouse&#8217;s daily active users are down 68% from a high in February 2021, though that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Clubhouse is over &#8212; it&#8217;s just becoming less of a daily habit. But if the company is able to build out its creator community and establish a number of popular shows, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">which it&#8217;s aiming to do via its accelerator,</a> it could still see users tuning in on a weekly and monthly basis. And those sessions would be longer in comparison with some other social apps, as Clubhouse users often tune into shows that run over an hour &#8212; even leaving the app open as they do other tasks.</p>
<p>For example, Clubhouse&#8217;s average session time per user is about 125% higher than Snapchat or Instagram. But compared with a streaming app like Spotify, sessions are shorter. Spotify&#8217;s average session per user is about 63% higher than Clubhouse, Apptopia data indicates.</p>
<p>However, Clubhouse is taking aim at the challenges around re-engaging people whose usage may have dwindled in recent days. Also during its townhall, the company announced it would introduce a bell icon for events that will allow users to be notified about the events to which they&#8217;ve RSVP&#8217;d. This will be important for creators who are advertising their events, as well.</p>
<p>Clubhouse didn&#8217;t give a specific time frame as to when its Android app would reach more testers or the wider public, only noting that it&#8217;s looking forward to welcoming more Android users in the &#8220;coming weeks.&#8221; In March, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">said the Android launch</a> would take a couple of months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the real world — the world on which the global economy runs — we don’t expose every aspect of our financial activity in public. We want to be able to select which parties can access our financial data and under what circumstances — for example, our credit history or bank transactions. The problem with the blockchain world is that this financial privacy doesn’t really exist. This has led to pretty bad abuses, such as the practice of &#8220;front-running,&#8221; where a nefarious person can take advantage of you immediately after seeing your transaction on a public blockchain. What’s required is a real infrastructure improvement to this problem, for, without it, the crypto &#8220;Shangri-La&#8221; of &#8220;DeFi&#8221; (decentralized finance) will never have a hope of taking off.</p>
<p>It’s therefore significant that some well-known organizations in the realm of blockchain financing are investing the equivalent of $11.5 million into SCRT, the native coin of the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> blockchain. The investment was led by <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.blocktower.com/">Blocktower Capital </a>and also includes <a href="https://www.spartangroup.io/">Spartan Group</a> and <a href="https://skynettrading.com/">Skynet Trading</a>.</p>
<p>Previous investors in Secret include <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.fenbushicapital.vc/">Fenbushi Capital</a> and <a href="http://hashed.com/">Hashed</a>, as well as <a href="https://secret.foundation/">Secret Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.enigma.co/">Enigma MPC, </a>and node operators such as <a href="https://figment.io/">Figment</a> and <a href="https://staked.us/">Staked</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tor Bair, founder of Secret Foundation said: “The addition of these valuable and experienced partners to the Secret ecosystem marks a significant inflection point for Secret Network as we concentrate on expanding and supporting our fast-growing application layer.”</p>
<p>Secret, which used to be called Enigma before a pivot, claims to have been the first privacy-first smart contract platform. (The first version of this blockchain was called the “Enigma Mainnet,” but this branding was changed to Secret Network via a governance vote in summer 2020).</p>
<p>So far in 2021, the Secret Network ecosystem has launched several native applications, including <a href="https://www.secretswap.io/">SecretSwap</a>, a “front-running resistant,” cross-chain AMM with privacy protections. It is also developing <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/secret-nft-update-reference-implementation-new-tutorial">Secret NFTs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So why is this at all significant?</strong><strong> Why should we care? </strong>It’s simply because, without privacy, DeFi is highly unlikely to go mainstream.</p>
<p>Without privacy in transactions, the traditional economic system won’t bother taking any notice of crypto and blockchain, outside of noting whether the price of bitcoin goes up or down.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Secret is not the only player tackling this area. It is playing in the same arena as blockchain projects such as Phala (not yet on mainnet, and built on Polkadot), Oasis and Aleo, which recently just fundraised via Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What these projects all have in common is this race toward what’s known as the Web3 &#8220;application privacy&#8221; space. Once again, they are trying to reproduce the kind of financial privacy that we have all come to expect from the traditional financial system, but which remains elusive in the blockchain world.</p>
<p>However, this approach should not be confused with privacy coins like Monero and Zcash. These are coins, and therefore not the same at all as the above-named projects, which are aiming at what’s known as &#8220;programmable privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bair told me: “Transactional privacy [via privacy coins] just means hiding simple aspects of transactions from other parties — a narrow form of privacy. Smart contract privacy — what we call &#8216;programmable privacy&#8217; — is a much more powerful idea, allowing developers to build complex decentralized and permissionless applications that also protect data privacy, with big consequences for Web3 security and usability. As an analogy — imagine trying to build a decentralized Facebook. Normal blockchains expose all data by default, a much worse outcome for user privacy and security. Only smart contract privacy allows you to build these types of complex applications without compromising the user experience and threatening their safety.”</p>
<p>Front-running is often described as getting a transaction first in line before a known future transaction occurs. Bair claims Secret protects against this at the protocol level because all interactions with smart contracts are encrypted and cannot be viewed even by the network validators, “so all DeFi applications built on Secret Network are front-running resistant by default” he told me.</p>
<p>That said, Secret will still have to compete with the myriad privacy projects already on — for instance — Ethereum, such as Automata. The Secret Network is a standalone blockchain and would still require a developer community to be successful, versus Ethereum and Polkadot, which technically have a head start, of sorts. But these blockchains are public by default. So Secret’s hyperfocus on the issue of privacy may yet make Secret a major player in this realm.</p>
<p>Bair commented: “Only programmable privacy can give users and developers this level of control in the DeFi world. Without programmable privacy, DeFi will never achieve mass adoption outside of purely speculative activity. Secret Network intends to become the foundation for new types of DeFi applications that better protect users while also allowing traditional institutions to participate securely, with protections for sensitive data. Also, blockchains don’t need thousands of developers to succeed in the short term — they need the right developers who build the early critical applications.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, Secret has in its favor the fact that due to the whole nature of decentralization of the blockchain, the space isn’t nearly as much a &#8220;winner-take-all&#8221; environment as the general internet has become due to the growth of the large Big Tech platforms — that would be counter to the point of decentralization. As Bair told me: “Secret’s vision is to become a data privacy hub for all public blockchains, collaborating more than competing with networks like Ethereum (to which we already have a live bridge with over $100 million in assets locked).”</p>
<p>Secret Network claims it was one of the first blockchains to feature privacy-preserving smart contracts, which it launched on mainnet in September 2020. It says this means all decentralized applications built on Secret Network have data privacy by default. The Secret Network blockchain itself is based on Cosmos SDK/Tendermint, giving it its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation. It is secured by the native coin Secret (SCRT), which must be staked by network validators and is used for transaction and computation fees as well as governance, said the foundation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment, Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital said: “Secret is the first blockchain ecosystem to prioritize privacy. Financial privacy is critical to individual freedom, and Arrington Capital has long been committed to financial privacy and censorship resistance. The rapid expansion of decentralized finance makes solutions like Secret Network a timely addition to the DeFi ecosystem.” (Arrington Capital was established by Arrington, who was also previously the founder of TechCrunch, but who has no involvement in the title these days).</p>
<p>Jamie Burke, founder of Outlier Ventures in the U.K. and a Secret backer, told me: “Privacy will be essential to the security and adoption of Web3, from DeFi to NFTs and beyond. Secret Network brings new and unique privacy functionality to the space, and as a result we believe it will be foundational to the next generation of successful Web3 applications.”</p>
<p>Secret is also getting support from DeFi players such as the <a href="https://sienna.network/">Sienna Network</a>. Monty Munford, Chief Evangelist and Core Contributor to the privacy DeFi company told me: “Of all the networks in all the world, we chose Secret because it was a yes-yes-yes brainer. They understand privacy and we understand DeFi; it’s a match made in heaven.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the Australian startup with a mission to electrify delivery fleets through e-bike subscriptions, announced a $12 million interim capital raise on Monday.</p>
<p>The company made a name for itself through partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash to help delivery workers access e-bikes through weekly subscriptions at discounted rates. Zoomo then grew to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/with-11-million-in-fresh-capital-bolt-bikes-rebrands-to-zoomo/">offer monthly subscriptions</a> to corporate partners in Australia, the U.S. and London for last-mile delivery, with a fleet that has expanded beyond 10,000 units globally.</p>
<p>Now, the startup hopes to expand its service outward toward continental Europe and other states across the U.S. It currently operates in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Zoomo also wants to build up its consumer model, which mainly serves couriers but is extending to commuters, and will invest in the development of its next generation of vehicle offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We initially built our products to service the demands of gig workers in the food delivery industry,&#8221; Mina Nada, Zoomo CEO and co-founder, said in a statement. &#8220;Their expectations for quality commercial vehicles, on demand service, flexible financing and tech enabled security features spurred us to innovate. We’re now seeing enterprises and fleet managers benefiting from the platform we have built. Enterprise fleet managers looking for clean and efficient vehicles are choosing us.”</p>

<p>Zoomo&#8217;s focus on e-bikes for food delivery makes it unique in the electric bike rental space. Its business model offers a full-stack e-bike, from the hardware and software to same-day servicing and financing options, which especially helps big business partners deploy and manage large fleets of vehicles at scale. It&#8217;s a tall order, and Zoomo&#8217;s strategy could be leading a new trend in micromobility of being a one-stop shop that promises quick scalability.</p>
<p>German mobility software provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">Wunder Mobility recently announced</a> its efforts to offer a souped-up e-moped that&#8217;s been co-designed with Chinese consumer manufacturer Yadea for the dockless sharing market. It also launched a new subsidiary to finance the vehicles, along with its software, to shared micromobility providers. Wunder Mobility plans to offer e-scooters and e-bikes for financing in the future, but it doesn&#8217;t design its own vehicles or sell them outright. While the business models and target customers don&#8217;t perfectly align, the blueprint is the same: Corner a market, provide top-quality hardware and software and make it as accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Coronavirus spurred a demand for delivery in all industries, and we can see companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/fluid-truck-the-zipcar-of-commercial-trucks-raises-63m-to-take-on-rental-giants/">FluidTruck</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">Rivian</a> stepping up to the plate to meet the needs of eco-conscious e-commerce giants with their electric delivery vans. The online food delivery industry is no different, with a market that&#8217;s expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/27/2217586/0/en/Online-Food-Delivery-Services-Global-Market-Report-2021-COVID-19-Growth-And-Change-To-2030.html">$192.16 billion in 2025</a> at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. But for delivery within cities, e-bikes offer a smarter solution for meeting climate change goals while dodging traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s custom-designed bikes can bear more than 200 kilograms of load via various cargo options, according to a Zoomo spokesperson. For enterprise customers, like health food company Cornucopia, e-cargo delivery vehicles like a Trailer Trike or a Covered Trike are used to deliver goods sustainably. Gorillas, an on-demand grocery delivery company, and Just Eat Takeaway, acquirer of Grubhub and Seamless, are also clients of Zoomo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>“At Just Eat Takeaway.com, we want to build a sustainable future for food delivery, and are committed to doing our bit to help keep carbon emissions to a minimum, as well as providing an efficient customer experience from order to delivery,&#8221; said a Just Eat Takeaway spokesperson in a statement. &#8220;E-Vehicles are an integral part of the Scoober model and we are pleased to work in cooperation with Zoomo.”</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s newest funding round, led by Australian VC AirTree, follows an $11 million Series A raised in August 2020, with support in both rounds from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Maniv Mobility and Contrarian Ventures. Withrop Square and Wisdom VC, mobility and clean tech-focused investors, also joined this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is known for its pitch-offs. We&#8217;ve had them in cities all over the world, and heard from hundreds of startups who have shared the story of their company on our stages.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be bringing the pitch-off to Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Anyone in the audience on an episode of Extra Crunch Live can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to be selected to pitch in front of the audience and get feedback from our all-star guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On ECL, pitch-off startups will have two minutes to tell us about their company. This is the equivalent of an elevator pitch — imagine running into a VC or potential customer at a tech conference like Disrupt or bumping into them at a park. As such, no visual aids are allowed, including decks, videos, demoes, etc.</p>
<p>Essentially, what can you convey with your words, in a short time frame, to get people to both understand your startup and be excited about it?</p>
<p>This is a critical skill, and we&#8217;re creating the space for founders to practice and improve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amped to have Firstmark&#8217;s Rick Heitzmann and Orchard founder Court Cunningham as guests on Extra Crunch Live on May 5. This founder/investor duo know exactly what it takes to deliver a great pitch. Do you have what it takes? <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">You can register here for free!</a></p>
