										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has named Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a former Affirm executive and angel investor, as its newest partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi will be based in the firm’s San Francisco office and focus on seed and Series A investments in emerging fintech and commerce companies &#8212; two core areas of focus for the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Christina’s expertise at the intersection of fintech and e-commerce is a perfect complement to BCV’s deep focus on these domains,” said Merritt Hummer, partner at BCV, who met Melas-Kyriazi while both attended Harvard Business School.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Harris, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, agrees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said his firm had been “looking for a long time” for someone well-versed in the intersection of fintech and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We at Bain Capital Ventures are very committed to domain expertise and building leadership positions in the areas we&#8217;re interested in,” he told TechCrunch.”Fintech and commerce are certainly two of those areas. More than half of our investing dollars go to work in those two categories. And what we&#8217;ve experienced is that some of the best companies don&#8217;t fit neatly into one category. They&#8217;re often at the seams between two activities.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Melas-Kyriazi, BCV now has seven investing partners based in San Francisco and Palo Alto. Its early-stage investing practice on the West Coast will continue to represent more than half of its investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm currently has $9.2 billion in assets under management. In May, it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed two funds </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at a combined $1.3 billion and announced a renewed focus on seed and Series A deals.. Since BCV’s first fund in 2001, the firm has invested over $4.5 billion in 365 companies and claims to have helped its portfolio realize over $430 billion in enterprise value. It’s backed the likes of Finix, GoCardless, Airbase and Orum. Recent IPOs include AvidXchange, FlyWire, Rent the Runway, and SmartRent, among a number of other </span><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/portfolio/?status=excited"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi went to Stanford University for undergrad and studied economics and engineering before joining Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. She then moved on to LinkedIn, where she worked “closely with product” before heading to Shift Cars in its early days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After attending Harvard Business School to get her MBA, Melas-Kyriazi started getting interested in fintech, realizing that “fintech infrastructure is fundamentally broken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She started working in product and growth at GoFundMe, which she said benefited from the fact that payment service providers like PayPal made it easier to accept payments and just in general from the new wave of fintech distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melas-Kyriazi then started alternative lender Affirm in 2019, where she went on the “wild ride” of seeing the company grow from 400 people to over 2,000 by the time she left. There, she got to work across multiple product areas and on the merchant side of the product team focused on enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized I really loved the zero to one phase of product building,” Melas-Kyriazi recalls. “I love working with founders at that stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was that passion that drew her to angel investing about five years ago &#8212; and ultimately to BCV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The move to VC felt like a natural transition,” Melas-Kyriazi said. “There are still so many hard problems left to solve, especially within fintech and commerce-tech and I am excited  to continue to work with great founders and back the next generation of mission-driven fintech founders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an angel investor, Melas-Kyriazi has invested in over 20 startups, many of which are in the fintech, proptech and enterprise SaaS sectors. In fact, BCV had worked with her on a number of early-stage deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have worked with Christina for many years as an angel investor partner on early-stage deals,” Harris said. “Her commitment to entrepreneurs’ success is second to none; she always goes the extra mile for founders,” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Melas-Kyriazi  is interested in a few broad categories &#8212; from buy now, pay later to how new payment rails are being built on top of decentralized networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other areas Melas-Kyriazi believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“continue to explode” are e-commerce enablement and B2B payments, which despite tremendous innovation, remains “quite broken” in her view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce is a logical area for BCV to invest considering that Bain Capital owns dozens of multibillion dollar retailers, noted Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that we can bring to the table for the benefit of our venture capital portfolio companies,” he told TechCrunch, “is access to Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and Michael stores, for example. The list goes on of the multibillion dollar global commerce businesses that we own as a firm. And then also, in terms of financial services, Bain Capital as a $130 billion asset management firm is an important player for all the banks and all the insurance companies and the broker dealers. So it is not purely a coincidence that we&#8217;ve chosen these two lanes.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra is set to expand its launch footprint, after exclusively flying its first few rockets from Kodiak, Alaska. The startup will fly a mission from Cape Canaveral in Florida for client NASA in January 2022, it <a href="https://astra.com/news/astra-announces-cape-canaveral/">announced</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at Space Launch Complex 46 on the sprawling Cape Canaveral Space Force Station grounds, which is a site that was previously used for missile testing before being subsequently deactivated until it was re-opened for commercial space operations in 1997. It saw sporadic use from then until its last mission in 2019.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s planned launch there is not only a big win for the company, but also for the U.S. Space Force&#8217;s Space Launch Delta 45, a space launch support squadron that is instrumental to launches taking off from U.S. soil. The mission got its necessary approvals in just &#8220;months,&#8221; as compared to multiple years for all the sign-off required for prior space launches.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243246" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Astra, this also means that it&#8217;ll have another active option for launches, which is important in terms of broadening the scope of what kind of orbits it can target for client payload delivery. Florida is also a popular launch location for reasons that include its historically relatively stable weather systems.</p>
<p>One of Astra&#8217;s core value propositions is that its rocket is small and its on-site launch operations lightweight enough that it can effectively deploy from a wide range of different sites within minimal personnel and site prep requirements, so diversifying its launch site pool is also key to demonstrating that in action.</p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon and Kelyn Brannon will be joining us as speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> next week, so be sure to tune in there to learn more about the company&#8217;s plans for 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is further investing in creator tools and video with today&#8217;s news it&#8217;s acquired the video creation and editing app, Vochi, for an undisclosed sum. The company will be bringing in both the IP at Vochi and its forty-person team, including its founders, to expand Pinterest&#8217;s set of video creation tools and to help its creators make more dynamic videos.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, Pinterest has been attempting to shift its focus away from being just an image pinboard &#8212; a home to static images used to inspire purchases and plans. Instead, Pinterest now sees its potential as a platform for creators who can share their ideas in video format &#8212; whether that&#8217;s recipes, DIY craft projects, home décor ideas, beauty tutorials, fashion ideas, or anything else. To capitalize on this activity, Pinterest this spring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">launched Ideas Pins</a> &#8212; a video-first feature that lets creators tell their stories using editing tools like voiceovers, music, transitions, and other interactive effects. More recently, Pinterest rolled out a new way for users to browse these videos in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">a TikTok-like &#8220;Watch&#8221; tab</a>, where it encouraged participation with $20 million in creator awards.</p>
<p>Pinterest also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">introduced</a> its own original video content, Creator Originals, and has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">helping creators make money from their videos</a> by tagging items for sale, participating in affiliate shopping programs, and engaging in brand partnerships, among other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243226" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With Vochi, Pinterest says it will have the ability to bring even more quality video to its users.</p>
<p>The Belarus-based video editing app was founded in 2019, by Ilya Lesun, Anna Buglakova, Vasily Kasnitsky, Sergei Malyutin, and incubated by Andrei Avsievich and Yury Melnichek from <a href="https://bulba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bulba.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638743037071000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oNgr0IgaY0J7-FMlaQgDI">Bulba Ventures</a>. The app leverages a proprietary computer vision-based video segmentation algorithm that applies various effects to specific moving objects in a video or to images in static photos. Its effect lineup includes a &#8220;motion&#8221; effect to highlight movement, a &#8220;glitch&#8221; effect, a &#8220;clones&#8221; effect, those that change the light and shadows, or those that add animated objects to videos &#8212; like a burst of butterflies or neon shapes, and much more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181216" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181216" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181216" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VOCHI.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181216" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VOCHI</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;To get this result, there are two trained [convolutional neural networks] to perform semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation and Instance Segmentation,&#8221; Vochi CEO Ilya Lesun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">had explained to TechCrunch</a> in a July interview. “Our team also developed a custom rendering engine for video effects that enables instant application in 4K on mobile devices. And it works perfectly without quality loss,&#8221; he had noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app also offers filters for photos and video and other traditional editing tools. As of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">earlier this year,</a> the app had around 500,000 monthly active users, around 20,000 who had committed to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>Pinterest told TechCrunch it was interested in Vochi because its technology is aligned with Pinterest&#8217;s investment in video as a format to help creators express themselves, and it appreciated how quickly the effects could be applied to video.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181219" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181219" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2181219" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="660" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=300,291 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=768,745 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=680,660 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-3.33.35-PM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181219" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> VOCHI</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to create a place where Pinners can go from inspiration to realization, and having more creator tools can help us further this vision,&#8221; said Bin Liu, Head of Creators Engineering at Pinterest, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to work with Vochi’s talented team to bring more video creation tools and quality content to our more than 400 million Pinners around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Vochi team will continue to work in Europe and the Vochi app, for the time being, will remain a standalone experience instead of being removed from the app stores. (Its company <a href="https://vochi.app/">website</a>, however, was not functioning as of this morning.) Pinterest declined to detail how it will later integrate Vochi&#8217;s technology into Pinterest directly, but a smart assumption would be that Pinterest would eventually offer its own video creation and editing experience within its flagship app.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Pinterest, Vochi had raised $4.2 million in funding and was on the path to a Series A. Investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/vochi-raises-additional-2-4-million-for-its-computer-vision-powered-video-editing-app/">in its most recent round</a> included TA Ventures, Angelsdeck, A.Partners, Startup Wise Guys, Kolos VC and angels from companies like Belarus-based Verv and Estonian unicorn Bolt.</p>

The Star Trek actor revealed the news himself during a <a href="https://ew.com/tv/shatner-in-space-special-to-debut-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">virtual panel</a> for the pop culture conference <a href="https://www.ccxp.com.br/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">CCXP Worlds</a>, <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/shatner-in-space-william-shatners-flight-blue-origin-amazon-special-1234885216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Deadline</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shat&#8221; was one of four crew members on Blue Origin&#8217;s second manned NS-18 mission that flew to an altitude of 66 miles aboard <em>New Shepherd</em>, crossing the so called Kármán line into space (though not orbiting the Earth). At 90 years old, he edged out 82-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">Wally Funk</a>, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">set the previous age record</a> for space flight just months earlier.</p>
<p>The documentary will give a look at what happened before, during and after the trip. The flight also included Blue Origin VP Audrey Powers, Planet Labs co-founder Dr. Chris Boshuizen and Glen de Vries, Medidata co-creator. This is the second of three crewed missions Blue Origin has planned for 2021, with the third (NS-19) set for December 9th. That flight will include Alan Shepard’s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley and GMA co-anchor Michael Strahan, along with four paying customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;My time in space was the most profound experience I could have ever imagined,&#8221; Shatner told <em>Deadline</em> in a statement. &#8220;This special documenting my journey gives a dramatic view of that experience, and my hope is that it inspires the world to see we must go to space to save Earth.&#8221; The documentary is set to air on Amazon Prime in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand on December 15th, and in other territories in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nearside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nearside</a>, the online bank for SMBs formerly called Hatch, announced today it has raised a $58 million Series B, just seven months after announcing its Series A. The latest round was led by Valar Ventures, with participation from Kleiner Perkins; Foundation Capital; Jim Breyer, the founder of Breyer Capital; Creative Artists Agency founder Michael Ovitz; Flexport founder Ryan Petersen; and Eventbrite founder Kevin Hartz.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth look at Nearside, take a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look a TechCrunch’s article from April 2021</a>, when the startup launched publicly and announced its $20 million Series A. After founder and CEO Thomson Nguyen’s last startup, Framed Data, was acquired by Square, he became entrepreneur-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins. There he found that many small business owners don’t have the cash flow to maintain business checking accounts without paying hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees per year.</p>

<p>Nearside offers business checking accounts with no monthly, overdraft or ATM fees, as well as a universal 1% cashback reward program that it says is a first in the SMB online banking space. It also recently launched Premium Cashback Rewards, that offer up to 5% cashback at merchants like Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Squarespace and Zero.</p>
<p>The company isn’t currently sharing its customer numbers, but Nguyen said its user base has increased by 800% since its Series A announcement.</p>
<p>Nearside is able to offer its universal 1% cashback reward program “because we’ve built our onboarding, payments and serving infrastructure in-house, we’re able to minimize the number of vendors we work with and thus keep more of the interchange revenue with nearside,” Nguyen said. “We can then pass on a larger chunk of this interchange revenue back to our customers in the form of Universal Cashback.”</p>
<p>Nguyen said that Nearside wasn’t planning to fundraise anytime soon after its last funding announcement, but “this Series B ended up being very opportunistic and allows us to build additional products to help our individual and small business customers start and grow,” especially as more SMBs began to return as the COVID-19 pandemic gradually subsides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup changed its name to Nearside “because we wanted to find a name that resonates with our customers at all stages of their business journey—from the individual freelancer, to the incorporated LLC owner, and beyond,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243210" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243210" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2243210" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?w=454" alt="Nearside customer LaShondra White of Sheer Faces" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg 1672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SheerFaces3.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243210" class="wp-caption-text">Nearside customer LaShondra White of Sheer Faces</p></div></p>
<p>Nearside doesn’t target any specific sectors, and it onboards incorporated small businesses, like <a href="https://www.mysalonsuite.com/members/lashondra-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheer Faces</a>, an eyelash extension and brow shaping boutique in East Pointe, Michigan <a href="https://www.nearside.com/blog/small-business-spotlight-sheer-faces-a-story-of-perseverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">owned by LaShondra White</a>. Its customers also include freelancers, solo entrepreneurs and people who haven’t formally started their business yet, he added.</p>
<p>“A trend I find really interesting is that the line between a business and an individual is getting blurrier as people are starting businesses whilst transitioning out of their current job,” Nguyen added. “We believe that during this crucial transition period, individuals are looking for easy and free business tools and checking accounts with debit cards that save them as much money as possible.”</p>
<p>Next year, Nearside’s product roadmap includes adding a Term Loan product, which is currently in limited beta, and <a href="https://www.nearside.com/sprout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprout</a>, which will allow SMB owners to incorporate their businesses from their Nearside Dashboards.</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Valar Ventures general partner James Fitzgerald said, “We couldn’t be more excited to support [Nearside] as they democratize access to banking and financial services for a new breed of entrepreneurs. They’re expanding the definition of small businesses beyond brick and mortar stores to include freelancers, gigsters and the self-employed. Their mission to jumpstart entrepreneurship in the U.S. is more important now than ever before, and we are thrilled to be part of the journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap, a startup that offers people a way to borrow against the equity in their homes without taking out loans, has raised $60 million in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Family Ventures led the investment, which brings Hometap’s total operating capital raised since its 2017 inception to $95 million. New and existing backers, including Bain Capital, Iconiq Capital, LLC, G20 Ventures, Pillar and General Catalyst, also put money in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name implies, </span><a href="http://www.hometap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers homeowners a way to “tap” into their home equity by taking on an investor in their property. That investor is essentially providing cash in exchange for a share of their home’s future value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the home sells or the homeowner “settles” the investment, Boston-based Hometap is paid an agreed-upon percentage of the sale price or current appraised value.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242983" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started this company not only because we thought it was a good business, but because we wanted to be part of something with a social mission,” CEO Jeffrey Glass said. “There are so many people that are house rich and cash poor &#8212; and might have a capital need such as renovating a house or paying for college where, historically their only alternative is to further borrow on, or sell their house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he declined to reveal revenue specifics, Glas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that in the first 10 months of this year, Hometap made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">four times as many home equity investments as it had during the same time period in </span><a href="https://www.hometap.com/press-release/hometap-rapid-growth-executive-hire-geographic-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said the company “more than tripled” its revenue growth this calendar year and more than doubled its employee headcount to 140 in the same time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect to more than double, or perhaps triple again, next year as well,” he told TechCrunch. “We’ve grown 14 consecutive quarters quarter-over-quarter, even right through the pandemic.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap claims that its model differs from others that charge people a share of appreciation. Such a model is more stressful for homeowners, according to Glass, because they don’t know how much they owe until they’ve sold or settled. Also, the biggest difference between a Hometap investment and a traditional loan is that the startup doesn’t require any monthly payments or charge interest. In fact, some people take the money from Hometap to pay down other debt and improve their FICO scores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers a 10-year term, meaning that homeowners will need to settle the investment within 10 years, and they can do that at any point in time within that 10-year period. Homeowners can settle their investment by buying out Hometap, selling their home or refinancing their first mortgage.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2242990" style="width: 4880px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2242990" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2242990 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg" alt="" width="4870" height="3247" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg 4870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MacBook_Pro_09_inquiry.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4870px) 100vw, 4870px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2242990" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap </span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says its software uses automated technology to make the process as simple as possible for a homeowner. It also uses proprietary financial models and forecasting tools as part of its investment process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glass emphasizes that the company is an investor, not a lender &#8212; and one that is offering a “smart loan alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hometap currently invests in 15 states (including Massachusetts, New York, California, Virginia, Florida and North Carolina). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital toward hiring, scaling its channel program/partnerships, expanding operations nationwide and introducing additional alternative financing products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for its revenue model, Hometap charges homeowners a one-time fee that gets deducted out of their proceeds, but most of its revenue comes from the investors putting up their capital to invest in the properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We get a fee from the capital we invest in these homes, including a fee to acquire a new investment, and then we’re paid a backend fee to manage that investment on an ongoing basis,” Glass told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminds me a bit of Pipe, a buzzy fintech that connects investors with startups with predictable revenue streams to offer them cash upfront. It too does not classify itself as a lender.</span></p>
<p>Alan Valkin, managing director at General Catalyst, notes that his firm has been investors in Hometap &#8220;since the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that Jeff and his team had identified a simple, homeowner-centric way for people to leverage the equity they&#8217;ve built in their homes and reach their financial goals without the added stress of debt&#8230;[in a way] that sets it apart from traditional financing providers and other fintech companies in this space,&#8221; he wrote via email.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Reed, managing director at American Family Ventures, in a written statement, said that since his firm made its first investment in Hometap in 2018, it has “strongly believed in its mission to give homeowners a more accessible way to create liquidity and financial flexibility from what is oftentimes their largest asset.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company takes on the heavy lifting of recapturing plastic containers, washing/sanitizing them and selling them back to restaurants for reuse.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Plastic containers are ending up in landfills and oceans all over the world as more countries stop accepting our recycled goods. This is adding up: The average American uses and throws away <a href="https://www.minderoo.org/plastic-waste-makers-index/findings/executive-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">110 pounds of single-use plastic</a> every year, yet only <a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-percent-recycling-actually-gets-recycled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8% of plastic is recycled in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>You might think that all of those clamshell plastic containers we get from restaurants, food delivery services and grocers are recyclable, but the reality is that not all recycling centers accept them.</p>

<p><a href="https://dispatchgoods.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dispatch Goods</a> co-founder and CEO Lindsey Hoell started the company in 2019 to build out an infrastructure that takes on the heavy lifting of recapturing plastic containers, freezer packs and packaging. All of those are taken back to the company&#8217;s facilities where they are washed, sanitized and sold back for reuse. Even restaurant or food delivery customers can text a number on the containers to schedule at-home collection from Dispatch Goods or deposit their containers in a return bin.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, Hoell had a career in medicine, but dreamed of moving to California and being a surfer. She ended up moving to California, which is where she became aware of the plastic crisis. Hoell met her co-founder, Maia Tekle, through the Sustainable Ocean Alliance while she was launching Dispatch Goods. At the time, Tekle was West Coast partnerships lead at Caviar.</p>
<p>“Recycling makes people think they are doing something good, but when we dug deeper, we found that we aren’t always doing good if there is no secondary market demand,” Hoell told TechCrunch. “Containers can only be downcycled, but there is not a good infrastructure in place to collect the containers and process them.”</p>
<p>Dispatch Goods set out to build that infrastructure and now collects and processes between 10,000 and 15,000 food packages a week. It is already working with over 50 customers, like DoorDash, Imperfect Foods and 50 restaurants in the Bay Area, including Bombera, which has replaced 4,000 containers since it began using Dispatch Goods over the summer, Hoell said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After replacing some 250,000 single-use plastics, overall, across its customers in 2021, the company today announces $3.7 million in seed funding. The round was led by Congruent Ventures and included Bread and Butter Ventures, Precursor Ventures, Incite Ventures, MCJ and Berkeley SkyDeck. The latest investment gives Dispatch Goods just under $4.7 million in total funding, Hoell told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Hoell and Tekle are hands-on founders, even learning to drive trucks and forklifts, but their small team needed a boost, especially after seeing their monthly revenue grow from $700 last September to $20,000 in May.</p>
<p>They sought out capital with the intention to grow the team and outfit their current facilities, including a microhub in San Francisco, to be able to handle the growth that was happening outside of that area and its new facility in Baltimore.</p>
<p>“This use case didn’t exist before, so we are making the best of it until we can strategize on what a facility for reuse would be like,” Hoell said. “We are in the middle of building that right now.”</p>
<p>They plan to invest the new funding into additional geographical expansion, adding more restaurant partnerships and exploring new packaging opportunities. The company is also bringing on three new people by the end of the year to join its current staff of nine.</p>

<p>Though Dispatch Goods is mainly working with restaurant partners, it did kick off a pilot program last month targeted at consumers. Hoell said there was interest from that side, but the company will stick to selling into businesses so that the ultimate barrier to entry will be low.</p>
<p>Hoell didn’t go into specifics with growth metrics, but did say the company tracks how many items it is collecting and how many stops it is making. At launch, the company was collecting around four items per stop, and that has grown to an average of 12 items, while the number of stops grew to around nine (from three).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hoell and Tekle are excited to bring in Christina O’Conor, vice president at Congruent Ventures, as one of their new board members.</p>
<p>“The zero-waste movement is rapidly growing and we see circular packaging as an inevitable part of a sustainable future,” O’Conor said in a written statement. “Lindsey and Maia have demonstrated that they have the hustle, strategic insights, and passion to create new systems to support an infrastructure designed for reuse.”</p>
<p>They also have some star power on their advisory team in actor Adrian Grenier, who is co-founder of DuContra Ventures. Grenier said what Dispatch Goods is doing “has been on my mind for a long time.” In fact, he is so anti plastic containers that he avoids takeout as much as he can and even brings in his own reusable containers.</p>
<p>“We know how challenging it can be to reinvent the world,” he added. “Everyone is excited about the on-demand lifestyle that technology has given us, but to what expense? Dispatch Goods can save businesses the convenience and give them the opportunity to be able to afford this kind of shift in business model.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Argo AI, an autonomous driving technology company, teamed up with advocacy group the League of American Cyclists (LAB) to come up with guidelines for how self-driving vehicles should identify and interact with cyclists. The goal is to set a standard for other AV companies in the industry to follow, particularly as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">self-driving industry moves away from testing and toward commercialization</a> and will become more commonplace in the coming years.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 41,000 cyclists are killed in road traffic-related incidents every year. While self-driving vehicles are expected to reduce collisions significantly, much of that anticipated safety is a result of good coding at the start. Self-driving cars learn from massive databases that categorize and identify objects and situations that might arise, and Argo&#8217;s guidelines emphasize training its models in a way that specifically notes cyclists, cycling infrastructure and cycling laws.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The creation of these guidelines is part of Argo’s dedication to building trust with community members and developing a self-driving system that provides a level of comfort to cyclists, by behaving consistently and safely,” Peter Rander, president and co-founder of Argo AI, said in a statement. “We encourage other autonomous vehicle developers to adopt them as well to further build trust among vulnerable road users.” </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243128" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">Argo</a>, which currently operates self-driving test vehicles throughout the U.S. and parts of Germany, said it collaborated with LAB&#8217;s community to hear about common cyclist behaviors and interactions with vehicles. Together, Argo and LAB came up with six technical guidelines for self-driving systems to detect cyclists, predict cyclist behavior and drive consistently.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="783CafY6OS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/argo-ai-can-now-offer-the-public-rides-in-its-autonomous-vehicles-in-california/">Argo AI can now offer the public rides in its autonomous vehicles in California</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Argo AI can now offer the public rides in its autonomous vehicles in California&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/argo-ai-can-now-offer-the-public-rides-in-its-autonomous-vehicles-in-california/embed/#?secret=783CafY6OS" data-secret="783CafY6OS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Cyclists should be a distinct object class</h3>
<p>Treating cyclists as a distinct class and labeling them as such will create a diverse set of bicycle imagery for a self-driving system to learn from. Systems should be trained on images of cyclists from a variety of positions, orientations, viewpoints and speeds. Argo said this will also help the system account for the different shapes and sizes of bikes and riders.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the unique behaviors of cyclists that distinguish them from scooter users or pedestrians, a self-driving system (or &#8216;SDS&#8217;) should designate cyclists as a core object representation within its perception system in order to detect cyclists accurately,&#8221; according to a statement from Argo. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Typical cyclist behavior should be expected</h3>
<p>Cyclists can be pretty unpredictable. They might lane split, walk their steed, make quick, jerky movements to avoid obstacles on the road, yield at stop signs, hop off the sidewalk and into the street. A good self-driving system should not only be able to predict their intentions, but also be prepared to react accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A SDS should utilize specialized, cyclist-specific motion forecasting models that account for a variety of cyclist behaviors, so when the self-driving vehicle encounters a cyclist, it generates multiple possible trajectories capturing the potential options of a cyclist’s path, thus enabling the SDS to better predict and respond to the cyclist’s actions.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><b>Map cycling infrastructure and local laws </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving systems often rely on high-definition 3D maps to understand their surrounding environment. Part of that environment should be cycling infrastructure and local and state cycling laws, Argo said. This will help the self-driving system to anticipate cyclists&#8217; movements – like merging into traffic to avoid parked cars blocking the bike lane or running red lights if there&#8217;s no traffic – and keep a safe distance from the bike lane. </span></p>
<h3>The system should act in a consistent, understandable and extra safe manner around cyclists</h3>
<p>Self-driving technology should operate in a way that seems natural so that the intentions of the AV are clearly understood by cyclists, which includes things like using turn signals and adjusting vehicle position while still in one lane if preparing to pass, merge or turn.</p>
<p>In addition, if driving near cyclists, the system should &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">target conservative and appropriate speeds in accordance with local speed limits, and margins that are equal to or greater than local laws, and only pass a cyclist when it can maintain those margins and speeds for the entire maneuver,&#8221; Argo said.</span></p>
<p>The self-driving system should also give cyclists a wide berth in case they fall, so it can swerve or stop.</p>
<h3>Prepare for uncertain situations and proactively slow down</h3>
<p>Self-driving systems should account for uncertainty in a cyclist&#8217;s intent, direction and speed, Argo said. The company gave the example of a cyclist traveling in the opposite direction of the vehicle, but in the same lane, suggesting that the vehicle be trained to slow down in that circumstance.</p>
<p>In fact, in most uncertain circumstances, the self-driving system should lower the vehicle&#8217;s speed and, when possible, give some more space between vehicle and cyclist. Slowing down speeds when the system is uncertain is pretty standard already in the AV developer world, even if it&#8217;s not always targeted specifically at cyclists.</p>
<h3>Continue to test cycling scenarios</h3>
<p>The best way to make the safety case for AVs is to keep testing them. Argo and LAB suggest developers of self-driving tech should continue both virtual and physical testing that&#8217;s specifically dedicated to cyclists.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A virtual testing program should be made up of three main test methodologies: simulation, resimulation, and playforward to test an exhaustive permutation of autonomous vehicle and cyclist interactions on a daily basis,&#8221; said the company. &#8220;These scenarios should capture both varying vehicle and cyclist behavior as well as changes in social context, road structure, and visibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Physical testing, which is usually done on closed courses and then on public roads, allows developers to validate simulation and ensure the tech behaves the same in the real world as it did in virtual. Argo says developers should test AVs on likely scenarios as well as &#8220;edge cases,&#8221; or rare situations. Testing on multiple public roads in many cities to give the system a diverse set of urban environments to learn from can generate both rare and common cases.</p>
<h3>Chasing public acceptance &#8230; and safety, of course</h3>
<p>Social acceptance is one of the key hurdles to bringing more AVs to the roads, and many people are not yet convinced of the safety of autonomous vehicles. In fact, <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/09/01114300/2108149_crosstabs_MC_TECH_AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLES_Adults_v1_AUTO.pdf">nearly half of those polled by market research firm Morning Consult</a> said AVs are either somewhat less safe or much less safe than cars driven by humans.</p>
<p>Making a vehicle safe for all road users is only half of the battle. Companies like Argo AI also have to ensure the people <em>believe</em> their vehicles to be safe, and standardizing safety practices across the industry might be one way to do that.</p>

<p>The <strong>Miami City Commission</strong> has thankfully voted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/miami-reinstates-e-scooter-pilot-after-brief-ban/">reinstate its e-scooter pilot program</a>, which it had briefly shut down due to safety concerns. They probably read my rant last week and were convinced, nbd. Anyway, e-scooters will be coming back to Miami on January 15, but with strict new safety measures in place, including riders being required to wear helmets and ride at 10 miles per hour on sidewalks, no side-by-side riding and only two operators can be on a block at a time. Do I smell an impending turf war?</p>
<p><strong>Segway</strong>, every shared micromobility operator&#8217;s favorite scooter manufacturer, is dipping its toes into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">sidewalk delivery robots</a>. Actually, it&#8217;s more like a whole foot. The company is partnering with robotics company <strong>Coco</strong> to provide the robotic base for the startup&#8217;s newest vehicles. Segway will build 1,000 bots for Coco to be launched in the first quarter of 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Luna,</strong> the computer vision company that&#8217;s trialing its tech with e-scooter company <strong>Voi</strong> to keep riders off sidewalks, created a demo for a low-cost, app-based solution for operators that want riders to verify parking compliance. It basically asks for an &#8216;AI parking selfie&#8217; so the algorithm can detect if the scooter is in a respectable location or not. This tech isn&#8217;t all that new, but as cities are getting more strict about sidewalk riding and parking, this could be a good, cheap solution for many operators.</p>
<p><strong>Gogoro</strong> and belt drive tech company <strong>Gates</strong>, have partnered up to co-develop &#8220;Flo Drive,&#8221; a two-wheel vehicle drivetrain system based on Gates Carbon Drive that will be exclusively available to vehicle makers within the Powered by Gogoro Network. The tech was displayed on the Gogoro Viva Mix Smartscooter at ECMA 2021 in Milan last week.</p>
<p>The <strong>Equitable Commute Project</strong> hosted an e-bike distribution and training event at the HOPE Program offices in the Bronx. The plan is to equip 5,000 frontline workers with e-bikes that have been subsidized and subject to accessible financing solutions. Vendors at the event included <strong>Van Moof</strong>, <strong>The Hub NYC</strong>, <strong>Zoomo</strong>, <strong>Rad Power</strong> and <strong>Ridepanda</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Urtopia</strong>, an e-bike company from China, debuted with what reporter James Crew calls &#8220;the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/urtopia-e-bike-is-basically-a-computer-on-wheels/">most technology advanced model</a> you&#8217;ll see this year.&#8221; The bike has a 250W hub motor with three levels of ride assist, an estimated 30- to 80-mile range, an integrated dot-matrix display, fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G, mmWave sensors for vehicle detection, an integrated alarm and so much more. And it&#8217;s pretty easy on the eyes, with a sleek aesthetic designed by Mathis Heller who has worked with BMW and Ikea in the past. The bike is available for <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/">pre-order via Indiegogo</a> at $2,000, but that price will double once it goes to retail.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based <strong>Bounce</strong> has priced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">first electric scooter</a> (the moped-looking kind, not a kick-scooter) at around $480. Look out, Ola, Bounce is comin&#8217; for you! The Infinity E1 features a swappable battery and some serious shock absorbers and front suspension system that can hopefully withstand Indian roads.</p>
<p>Never thought I&#8217;d see <strong>Tesla</strong> on my micromobility roundup, yet here we are. The company, which is keeping us on the edge of our seats waiting for its Cybertruck, will be selling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/tesla-is-now-selling-a-1900-electric-cyberquad-atv-for-kids/">mini Cyberquad for kids</a> in the next two to four weeks. It&#8217;ll cost $1,900, which is expensive for a toy, but cheap for a Tesla.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a deal as much as an unwinding of one. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi said it has started the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/">process of delisting</a> from the New York Stock Exchange. Didi will The decision came days after Bloomberg reported the Chinese government had asked Didi to delist from the U.S. out of security fears.</p>
<p>As Rita Liao reports, the move is anything but surprising. The SoftBank-backed mobility powerhouse has faced immense regulatory pressure since it failed to assure Beijing its data practices were secure before its blockbuster IPO earlier this year that gave it a valuation of $73 billion. Troubles since then have pushed its market cap down to about $37.6 billion.</p>
<p>One of its biggest issues is access to the Didi app. The company, which had about 500 million annual users as of March, pulled itself from Chinese app stores after it came under a cybersecurity review in early July. People with the app installed on their phones can continue using it but new users or those who have switched phones would have to download Didi alternatives, Liao noted.</p>
<p>Didi does intend to stay a public company, just not on the American exchange. It will apply to list on the Hong Kong exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CloudTrucks</strong>, a California-based startup sells business management software to trucking operators, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">$115 million Series B round</a> led by Tiger Global with participation from Menlo Ventures, as well as investment from Flexport and angel investors Michael Ovitz and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, and brought the startup&#8217;s total funding amount to $141.6 million.</p>

To date, the company has raised $800 million.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <strong>state public utilities commissions</strong>. (Are you starting to snore already? Stay with me!) These powerful regulators don&#8217;t often get much mainstream media attention, but each year they craft a whole host of policies that have implications for the future of decarbonization and &#8212; most salient for us at Policy Corner &#8212; the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>How? Well, utilities commissions have the authority to create what are essentially taxes on electric utility ratepayers &#8212; funds that could go toward incentive programs for EV chargers. Here&#8217;s a more specific example: <strong>Evergy Inc.</strong>, the Kansas City-based electric utility, could start offering customers a one-time rebate of $500 to wire their homes for EV chargers. These costs would be fronted by Evergy and later recouped by ratepayers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a powerful way to essentially use the structure of a tax without having to go through the hassle of passing a new tax regulation. Of course, electric utilities are not angels, and there can be inflationary issues when it comes time for customers to pay for these programs (<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/missing-from-biden-ev-plan-state-support-for-charging/">this article provides more context</a>). But well-crafted policies could help drive the transition to EVs by lowering the upfront cost for consumers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. This week, ​​<strong>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo</strong> said that EV adoption goals as outlined in <strong>President Joe Biden&#8217;s</strong> Build Back Better plan will be impossible to meet without greater investment in domestic chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, she wants Congress to pass the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act, or <strong>CHIPS Act</strong>, one part of a broader bill to boost American competitiveness and decrease reliance on China. The CHIPS Act in particular would earmark more than $50 billion to U.S. companies that manufacture semiconductors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not hit those goals if Congress does not quickly pass the Chips Act,&#8221; Raimondo reportedly said. &#8220;We are wasting time, precious time, every day that the Chips Act isn&#8217;t passed and appropriated in Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry agrees. This week, more than 50 CEOs &#8212; including that of <strong>Apple</strong>,<strong> Ford</strong>, <strong>General Motors</strong>, <strong>Volkswagen America</strong>, <strong>Toyota North America</strong> and <strong>Nvidia</strong> &#8212; <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CEO-letter-to-Congress-on-CHIPS-and-FABS.pdf">sent a letter to Congressional leaders</a> urging them to take action on the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, demand for these critical components [semiconductors] has outstripped supply, creating a global chip shortage and resulting in lost growth and jobs in the economy,&#8221; the letter says. &#8220;The shortage has exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain and highlighted the need for increased domestic manufacturing capacity.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> shares its perspective on safety <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/building-for-scale-when-it-comes-to-safety-its-important">in a blog post</a> that outlines the questions that every company planning to remove the safety operator from behind the wheel should be able to answer.</p>
<p><strong>Daimler Truck</strong>, which is working with <strong>Waymo Via</strong> and <strong>Torc</strong> on autonomous Class 8 trucks, has developed a scalable autonomous truck platform that it says is suited to SAE Level 4 autonomous driving. It includes redundancy systems needed to achieve safe operations, like a braking system, steering system, low voltage power net and network communications.</p>
<p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> is pairing up with <strong>Nuro</strong> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-7-eleven-autonomous-delivery-service-california/">pilot a commercial delivery service</a> using autonomous vehicles in the Silicon Valley enclave of Mountain View, California. This is a limited pilot that is using Nuro&#8217;s self-driving Priuses. The aim is to expand the service and switch Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivery vehicles, which were custom built to delivery only packages &#8212; not people.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Electrify America</strong> has installed more than 30 megawatts of energy storage capacity at more than 140 ultra-fast DC charging stations around the United States, reaching a goal it first announced in 2019. The battery energy storage systems, which are Tesla Powerpacks, store power when electricity costs are low and supplement power during high points of consumption, minimizing impact on the electrical grid and mitigating demand surges.</p>
<p><strong>Polaris</strong> is launching the RANGER XP Kinetic, the first powersports vehicle out of the company&#8217;s rEVd up initiative and electrification strategy which was announced September 2020. Through rEV&#8217;d up, Polaris and Zero Motorcycles have signed a 10-year exclusive partnership agreement in off-road vehicles and snowmobiles. The company also announced a partnership with EV home charging company Qmerit.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> laid out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-new-polestar-suv-and-how-it-fits-in-the-automakers-three-year-plan/">three-year plan</a> and gave a peek at its upcoming Polestar 3 SUV. Reporter Alex Kalogianni also did a deep dive into the Precept concept and explains how it provides a physical representation of the company&#8217;s future, which could help consumers and eventual shareholders better understand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/04/the-polestar-precept-is-a-cypher-for-the-ev-automakers-future/">what the EV automaker intends to become</a>.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p>In a sign of the crypto times, <strong>Holoride</strong> has begun publicly selling its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/holoride-debuts-ride-crypto-the-currency-of-its-in-car-metaverse/">Ride cryptocurrency token</a>. For the unfamiliar, Holoride is the Audi-backed startup that’s creating an in-vehicle virtual reality entertainment system designed for passengers.</p>
<p>The launch of the crypto is the latest move by Holoride to build up its extended reality (XR) ecosystem of games and experiences created by a community of developers. Vehicle passengers keen to experience virtual worlds or play games — all of which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/holorides-in-car-vr-solution-is-the-best-thing-at-ces-2019/">in tune with the movement the car</a> they’re riding in — will have to use the Ride utility token to make purchases.</p>
<p>Holoride is aiming to offer its XR system in private vehicles next year, although details of which brands and when it might launch are scant. The company had previously said it would launch in summer 2022, but has since pulled back on specific timing for next year.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> has hired or promoted several executives recently. Ralph Jakobs was named as vice president of program management, Emad Dlala, who has been with the company since 2015 is now a vice president of powertrain and Zak Edson is vice president of sales and service.</p>
<p><strong>Zum</strong> has hired Liz Sanchez as its first-ever executive vice president of school transportation. In this role, Sanchez will be responsible for building and scaling student transportation operations and Zum&#8217;s overall footprint across the U.S. Sanchez has more than three decades of  school transportation experience, including serving as COO of North America Student Transportation for National Express School.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australia is emerging onto the online used car scene with Carma, a startup that just raised a $20 million (AUD $28 million) seed round from Tiger Global, a U.S. investment firm. Carma has been operating in stealth for the past nine months and said the funding enabled the company to recruit an executive team, develop its website, and establish its first inspection and reconditioning facility in Sydney.</p>
<p>Carma isn&#8217;t the first online car dealership with a punny name: The startup joins the ranks of Carvana and Vroom in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/online-car-buying-platform-clutch-wants-to-service-90-of-canadians-by-end-of-2023/">Clutch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/canada-drives-raises-79-4-million-to-expand-online-car-purchasing-and-delivery-platform/">Canada Drives</a> in Canada, Kavak in Mexico, and Cazoo in the U.K. They&#8217;re all coming to fruition as the pandemic resulted in a shortage of semiconductors, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/car-sales-chip-shortage.html">led to automakers being unable to meet the rising demand for vehicles</a>. Increasingly, consumers want a contactless, frictionless way to not only search for and buy a used car, but also have it delivered to their doors &#8212; a service companies like Carma are offering in their native markets around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are convinced there is a massive opportunity to disrupt the used car industry in Australia by replicating an online, full-stack model that we see achieving success in the U.S. and globally,” said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Carma will open to Sydney customers first, but plans to expand throughout the state of New South Wales in the coming months and to Brisbane and Melbourne next year. The startup said it would begin another round of fundraising soon to support its accelerated expansion plans in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investment in the digital used car dealership space is very active globally, given the international success of the model,&#8221; Carma co-founder and CEO Lachlan MacGregor said in a statement. &#8220;Having this significant backing from Tiger Global has been a fantastic vote of confidence in Carma and allowed us to move rapidly to build out an exceptional team, technology stack and physical infrastructure. We skipped the startup phase and were able to go straight to scaling up with a proven business model.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this sizable seed round, Carma is gearing up to launch its online platform. The company currently has a fleet of 300 vehicles in stock, which it sources from private sellers, other dealers and auctions, but will shortly have over 500, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typically, our cars are under five years old, with less than 100,000 kms (62,137 miles), and with the latest features,&#8221; a spokesperson for Carma told TechCrunch. &#8220;After we buy them, they undergo a thorough mechanical inspection, repair and reconditioning process in-house, before being photographed at our state-of-the-art facility in Sydney. We will only sell cars that meet our high standards.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Customers looking at cars on Carma&#8217;s platform will be able to view 360-degree high-res imagery of the exterior and interior, with any flaws called out and photographed. The company says it will offer transparent prices and over-the-phone and online customer support. After a checkout process that can take as little as 10 minutes, the car is delivered to the customer&#8217;s home, and they have a week to try it out. If they&#8217;re not satisfied, they get their money back &#8212; all standard stuff in this industry.</p>
<p>The Australian used car landscape is fragmented, and the online car buying space is somewhat limited to classifieds and Facebook Marketplace. Carma has no major competition to speak of, so it has a chance to corner the market while it&#8217;s hot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups digitizing B2B e-commerce and retail in Africa continue to grab the headlines after the pandemic paved the way for widespread offline retail and commerce disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">TradeDepot</a>, a Nigeria- and U.S.-based company that connects consumer goods brands to thousands of retailers and help out with distribution, has raised $110 million in new equity and debt funding round as it looks to bring in more retail stores and expand its buy now, pay later service across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though TradeDepot did not comment on the share of equity to debt, data from the company’s SEC filing pegs the equity share at almost $42 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243095" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B funding is coming almost eighteen months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">raising $10 million</a> co-led by Partech Africa and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IFC led the round this time while Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital participated. The debt funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arcadia Funds, a lender that specializes in p2p and marketplace lending and insurance-linked securities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the round, Wale Ayeni, the head of Africa Venture Capital Investment for the IFC and Brian Odhiambo, the West Africa director of Novastar Ventures, will join TradeDepot’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot operates a B2B marketplace that connects small shops, kiosks, retailers with wholesalers of global consumer brands who have access to food, beverages and personal care products. The company owns its warehouses and fleets of drivers to carry out distribution.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company had over 40,000 merchants on its platform; now, it is servicing more than 100,000 merchants, according to CEO Onyekachi Izukanne. On the call with the CEO, he also mentioned that TradeDepot grew its GMV by 5x within this period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past five years, TradeDepot’s main work centred around building out the supply chain with technology and onboarding retailers one at a time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company now provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a full range of products to those onboarded, rolling out digital wallets and financial services, particularly credit or BNPL offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BNPL offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is embedded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the company’s ShopTopUp platform, where retailers can access a credit line for all consumer goods on the application.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as any B2B e-commerce platform offering BNPL services, TradeDepot does not provide these merchants with cash advances. Instead, it sends the products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them while they pay in instalments. The repayment value stands at almost 5% per month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Merchants are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">able to double or triple what they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of this access</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that these embedded financial services will be a key part of this narrative: Supply chain on the one hand, and everything related to financial services to make these businesses work on the other,” said the CEO. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they go together. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the last year and a half have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been defined by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focusing on bringing more of these embedded finance products to market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 when the five-year-old company announced plans to offer credit, it built scoring models by using equity to finance credit to the retailers off its balance sheets. The company claims its BNPL model has led to a 200% increase in transaction volumes for retail store owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s on the back of track of lending to these retailers (looking into their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> history, previous repayment performance and other related data points to predict their creditworthiness) for 18 months that TradeDepot is setting up a debt structure to execute at scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large majority of small and medium-sized businesses in Nigeria and across Africa are offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses generate $1 trillion in sales </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent’s nominal GDP</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers are catching the eyes of a growing cohort of startups who see opportunity in providing digital infrastructure and financing to a fragmented distribution network across the value chain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the jury is still out on whether retailers can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use and scale with online methods, prominent players such as Capiter, Sokowatch, Alerzo, MarketForce, Sabi and Omnibiz, keep expanding across major African markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa’s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,” said </span>Makhtar Diop, IFC’s Managing Director, in a statement<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot’s Series B round is the largest for any B2B e-commerce platform in Africa at the moment, both in equity and debt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was one of the earliest players in the space and started out distributing milk to small retailers in Lagos, Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Izukanne believes the emergence of new startups targeting the market at various touchpoints, inserting convenience and innovative pricing has made it easier for investors to see the opportunity in offline retail digitization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Four or five years ago, if you were having a conversation with an investor, there was a lot of education required to convince them why this was an opportunity and why they should come on board,” said the CEO who founded the company with Michael Ukpong and Ruke Awaritefe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we’re seeing is that the market is now awake to that opportunity. You have more parties, especially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serious ones coming in and trying to help build this. There’s a lot of iteration required to figure out the models that work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more parties that you find hacking at this kind of speeds up innovation within the space, so that’s super useful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TradeDepot is active across 12 cities in Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa (Accra, Johannesburg and ten cities in Nigeria)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Izukanne said with the new funding, TradeDepot will double down activities in these three countries and increase its footprint across Nigeria, trying to capture more of the 5 million SMEs it sees as its target market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debt financing will support the delivery of the BNPL service to these retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Venture Souq, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors also participated in the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series B round brings its total raised to over $17 million and values TamatemGames at around $80 million, Hussam Hammo, CEO and founder of Tamatem Games told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tamatem publishes games relevant to Arabic users and customizes its games to fit the culture.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The users need to feel that the game was made for them, not just translated from one language to another. Tamatem makes the games culturally relevant to the end-users,” said Hammo. “The demand for relatable and enjoyable mobile games is higher than ever and our mission is to provide our region with the best gaming experience possible.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tamatem will use the latest funding to amplify its efforts by bringing various games with more popular titles to the Arabic-speaking market. The startup will hire local talents in Saudi Arabia to expand further. The gaming industry is booming in Saudi Arabia, with about 70% of Tamatem&#8217;s users, Hammo noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Big things are happening for the mobile games industry in the region. We are reaping the rewards of our past successes and pushing forward with more experience and more grit. We are at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the massive potential of mobile games in MENA, and I am always super elevated when more people invest in the industry and the region,” Hammo said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup also plans to launch a gaming academy to train, educate, and elevate employment in the industry in pursuit of pushing the market&#8217;s growth and maturity. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We see huge potential in the MENA region and are happy to have started our investment journey here with a prolific publisher like Tamatem.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of investors including Sequoia Capital India and Steadview Capital are in talks to back Polygon, which operates a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, by way of tokens purchase, three sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The investors are looking to purchase tokens worth $50 million to $150 million, sources said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private. As is common with these token transactions, investors will be able to buy the coins at a slight discount. (20% discount on the average price of MATIC in the past one month, from what I have heard.)</p>
<p>Deliberations are ongoing, so the terms may change. Nobody had a comment early last week.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polygon, formerly known as Matic, has established itself as one of the most popular layer two solutions. The firm, whose market cap has exceeded $14 billion, processes over 7.5 million transactions a day and allows thousands of decentralized apps to continue to use Ethereum as the settling layer but avoid the increasingly pricey gas fee.</p>
<p>Aave, Sushi Swap, and Curve Finance are among some of the largest bluechip projects that have deployed on Polygon, which has amassed one of the largest developer ecosystems (even when compared to some layer 1 blockchains).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243202" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243202" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2243202 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="437" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=150,44 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=300,87 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=768,224 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=680,198 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/polygon-eth-transactions.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243202" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Polygon</p></div></p>
<p>An investment will mark a shift in the investors&#8217; perception of India-based Polygon, which until recent years struggled to receive backing from most prominent venture firms in the South Asian market. (Most VCs in India, it&#8217;s worth noting, were also not actively tracking the web3 space until a few quarters ago.) Furthermore, Polygon has had to confront at least one episode where some of its early investors requested their money back during a bear cycle, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The firm returned money to some of those investors and survived. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the themes with the Polygon team. Their perseverance is next level,&#8221; said a former employee.</p>
<p>Polygon, which received backing from entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban this year, is among dozens of side-chains and roll-up networks that is hopeful that Ethereum will continue its dominance even as a handful of other layer one projects such as Polkadot, and Solana, which is backed by Multicoin Capital and A16z, are attempting to court the nascent but fast-growing developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>On Bankless podcast earlier this year, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal (pictured above) said the web3 developer ecosystem today is centred around Ethereum and he is hopeful that the network effect won&#8217;t dissipate. On the same podcast, Nailwal and Mihailo Bjelic, another co-founder of Polygon, said Polygon is increasingly expanding its offerings to build a blockchain infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba is reassigning roles to four of its executives in one of the biggest reshuffles in its recent history, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211205005036/en/Alibaba-Group-Announces-CFO-Succession" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Maggie Wu, the e-commerce titan&#8217;s former chief financial officer, will step down next April and be replaced by Toby Xu, current deputy CFO. Wu will continue to be a partner in Alibaba Partnership, an exclusive group of personnel with major influence on the company&#8217;s directions, and will remain as an executive director on the Alibaba board.</p>
<p>Wu was instrumental in Alibaba&#8217;s three public listings since she joined about 15 years ago: Alibaba.com (the firm&#8217;s B2B marketplace) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007, Alibaba Group Holding on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2019. Alibaba is one of the U.S.-listed Chinese firms that have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pursued secondary listings</a> in Hong Kong amid rising U.S.-China tensions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in 1999, Alibaba already went through a major reshuffle when Jack Ma passed the torch as CEO to Daniel Zhang<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/aliglobal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2015</a> and further appointed him as chairman<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/09/alibaba-announces-ceo-daniel-zhang-will-succeed-jack-ma-as-chairman-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The announcement of Alibaba’s CFO transition today is the culmination of extensive preparation over many years and a part of Alibaba’s leadership succession planning,&#8221; said Wu in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The markets will always have ups and downs, but Alibaba has ambitious long-term goals. We are in a relay race and we must have new generations of talent to take the company forward. I trust Toby even more than I trusted myself when I first took up the CFO position years ago,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Xu joined Alibaba from PwC three years ago and first appeared as deputy CFO at the firm&#8217;s investor day last year. He has overseen several major deals at Alibaba, including the <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p200721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-commerce titan&#8217;s partnership</a> with Starbucks in China.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the CFO succession, Alibaba also unveiled major reorganization to buttress its two-pronged strategy of domestic and international e-commerce, Daniel Zhang said in an <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-introduces-more-agile-organizational-structure-to-accelerate-domestic-and-international-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal letter</a>.</p>
<p>Jiang Fan, who steered the firm&#8217;s core revenue drivers, its consumer-facing marketplaces in China, for years, will lead the newly-formed International Digital Commerce. The international unit includes Southeast Asia-focused Lazada, in which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alibaba acquired control in 2016</a>. Alibaba has also bought a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-26/alibaba-backed-trendyol-seeks-over-1-billion-to-fund-growth#:~:text=Alibaba%20recently%20invested%20another%20%24350,%249.4%20billion%2C%20the%20people%20said." target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority stake in Turkey&#8217;s Trendyol</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/alibaba-buys-rocket-internets-daraz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired Daraz</a>, its counterpart in South Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to focus on becoming a truly globalized company, and we believe that overseas markets present many exciting potential and opportunities for us to capture,&#8221; wrote Zhang in his letter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm&#8217;s domestic consumer-oriented and wholesale marketplaces will be merged to form the new China Digital Commerce unit and come under the stewardship of Trudy Dai. Dai has been spearheading two of Alibaba&#8217;s new growth drivers, Taobao Deals, its bazaar targeting lower-income demographics in China, and Taocaicai, its neighborhood grocery service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pariti.io/">Pariti</a>, the Kenya-based community-led marketplace building the digital infrastructure for startup ecosystems in emerging markets, has raised $2.85 million seed, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">Harlem Capital</a>. In Africa, it’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first deal of the diversity-focused fund that secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">$134 million for its second fund</a> earlier this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other investors &#8212; Better Ventures, Accelerated Ventures, Diverse Angels, AVG Basecamp and New General Market Partners participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to be working with Harlem Capital,” co-founder and CEO Yacob Berhane said of Harlem’s participation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Their focus on data, process and supporting underserved ecosystems aligns </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with our mission and makes them an amazing partner for us to build with.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/">covered</a> Pariti in March, the company which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">connects founders in emerging markets to resources, talent and capital, was fresh out of finding product-market-fit.</span></p>
<p>Pariti was founded by<a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yacob-berhane-38981541"> Yacob Berhane</a> and<a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/wayele"> Wossen Ayele </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019. This past year, CEO Berhane said the company has grown 795% and attributed this growth to the pandemic and how the African tech ecosystem has hit an inflection point, minting half a dozen unicorns within this period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic was a Black Swan event because we saw a major jump in activity on our platform. Remote staffing and remote investing accelerated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a bet we made a while back but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anticipate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what was coming,” Berhane said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And after taking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ten years to get Africa’s first unicorn, we had six announced in roughly six months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led to a significant increase of interest from local and international investors for African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti has over 880 companies across 42 countries on its platform, up from 500 early this year. But Berhane does not share any other numbers to reflect the progress from the 100 freelance experts and 60 investors TechCrunch reported in March.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Pariti is connecting founders with capital, resources and talent in emerging markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/embed/#?secret=4mKVGzkX5w" data-secret="4mKVGzkX5w" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ecosystems.500.co/resources/africa-500s-next-ecosystem-hub">Data from BCG</a> says that Africa appears to be at the dawn of a startup revolution, with the ecosystem “growing at a 46% annual rate, which is six times faster than the global average.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with some founders needing support more than ever after in an inefficient ecosystem with trust issues, platforms like Pariti will become critical for founders and investors to negotiate on neutral terrain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti’s principal product is the Recommendation Engine, where founders submit their companies for review and feedback from experts on the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the engine suggests personalized next steps for the founders to take in areas where the company needs help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kenya-based marketplace also helps talent monetize their skills and VCs and angels to find, vet and execute deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane mentions that Pariti’s pitch assessment and recommendation engine also has some predictability features where the platform can tell how companies will perform with fundraising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we’ve looked at the companies that have been able to go on and raise money after submitting the Pariti pitch review, and companies that score over 70 on a Pariti score have a 50% likelihood of connecting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with investors,” the CEO said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But companies that score above 78 have shown correlation to having 8x likelihood of raising capital, which is pretty dramatic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a few founders who have used the platform and spoke </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">anonymously to TechCrunch, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also helped them get into global accelerators such as Y Combinator and Techstars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane confirmed that five companies have gotten into Y Combinator after using Pariti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the startups is <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/fingo-africa">Kenyan neobank Fingo</a>, a startup highlighted in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-pariti-is-connecting-founders-with-capital-resources-and-talent-in-emerging-markets/">previous article</a> that had secured a $250,000 pre-seed round in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Pariti builds this community of founders, investors and freelancers that have the right mindset to elevate this ecosystem, nobody has to be a gatekeeper. You’re fostering a certain mentality of ‘we will get further together.’ It’s bigger than any one of us,” Berhane stated, emphasizing the need for Pariti to democratize access to global investors and accelerators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coaching and mentorship services have picked up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the platform, too, appearing in different forms: VC fellows to founder, founder to founder, expert to founder, and investor to founder, the company said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With access to this support and investors, companies have raised over $20 million in debt and equity this past year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti seed funding will allow it to build SaaS workflows to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forms of raising capital, from traditional equity and debt to DeFi solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to enhance its talent marketplace, create a bespoke solution for investors looking to invest and support founders, hire talent, build bigger communities and expand into new markets.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MarketForce, a Kenyan B2B retail and financial services distribution startup, has expanded into five additional markets across Africa to grow <a href="https://marketforce360.com/rejareja-on-demand-salesforce.html">RejaReja</a> &#8212; its retailer ‘super app’ that makes it possible for informal merchants to order and pay for inventory digitally, accept payments for utility bills, and access financing for their businesses.</p>
<p>The startup has today announced entry of RejaReja, the B2B retail marketplace, into Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, after successful pilot programs, coming about two months after it grew beyond Kenya by launching in Nigeria.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a> has partnered with Cellulant, a pan-African payments company that makes it possible for local and international merchants to accept “locally relevant and alternative” payment methods from their customers, to expand into these new markets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243165" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are working with Cellulant to open the new markets, and the reason is they already have a presence in these markets and have partnerships with both banks and billers. This will ensure that we focus on acquiring new merchants,” MarketForce’s co-founder and CEO, Tesh Mbaabu told Techrunch.</p>
<p>Cellulant has partnerships with 46 mobile-money operators in Africa, 120 banks and serves 35 African countries with a physical presence in 18, according to the payments firm. RejaReja is set to tap Cellulant&#8217;s coverage to grow across the continent.</p>
<p>“We have been piloting this partnership for six months and are happy to announce the plan to extend the fruitful relationship we have built with MarketForce in Kenya&#8230;This collaboration will make our digital financial services available to millions of Africans, with the goal of significantly boosting financial inclusion and incomes for merchants across Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Cellulant chief business officer, David Waithaka.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243166" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243166" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243166" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg 5176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MarketForce-Tesh-Cellulant-David.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243166" class="wp-caption-text">Cellulant chief business officer, David Waithaka and MarketForce co-founder and CEO Tesh Mbaabu. <strong>Image credits</strong>: MarketForce.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mbaabu said that they aim to grow their RejaReja merchants tenfold to 1 million by the end of next year. RejaReja has experienced a rapid growth since its launch in December 2020 with over 87,000 orders made through the platform to date at an average basket value of $151. It is expected to record $60 million in annualized transaction volume by the end of this month.</p>
<p>“In November we hit 100,000 merchants in Kenya and Nigeria and this number is growing quite rapidly. Currently, we are growing 40% month on month. This shows how strong our service is,” said Mbaabu.</p>
<p>“The growth is because the merchants are seeing the value, it is a vote of confidence in our platform by the merchants. And a lot of them are using technology for their businesses for the first time,” said Mbaabu, who co-founded MarketForce with Mesongo Sibut in 2018 as an SaaS product for the formal markets. The service’s active users include Unilever, Pepsi, Safaricom and CocaCola. MarketForce recently raised $2 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The startup’s plan for RejaReja is to have a presence in every market across sub-Saharan Africa in the near future by building an all inclusive platform for the informal merchants, who sell a huge chunk of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa about <a href="https://nextbillion.net/informal-retailers-mobile-solutions-emerging-markets/">80%</a> of household retail is delivered through informal retailers but these shops are faced with a number of challenges like stockouts, earnings instability and financing that make it hard for their businesses to grow.</p>
<p>MarketForce, through RejaReja, is providing solutions to these challenges by ensuring next-day delivery of goods, and using their data to develop the credit profiles needed to secure loans. The startup has partnered with <a href="https://pezesha.com/">Pezesha</a> &#8212; a digital financial marketplace platform &#8212; to extend loans to its merchants.</p>
<p>Mbaabu said, “we see RejaReja being the largest retail distribution network in sub-Saharan Africa.”<br />
“The goal is to empower all these merchants to grow their incomes and profits in a digital age, to access inventory, to act as special agents for various financial services, and to make extra income as a result. We are able to extend working capital loans too.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://stackedinvest.com/">Stacked</a>, a web-based platform that provides passive investment tools for retail investors interested in crypto, just announced it raised a $35 million Series A co-led by <a href="https://www.alameda-research.com/">Alameda Research</a>, a crypto trading firm owned by <a href="https://ftx.com/">FTX</a> founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bybit and BitDAO partner <a href="https://www.mirana.xyz/">Mirana Ventures</a> co-led the round alongside Alameda. <a href="https://fisv.com/">Fidelity International Strategic Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.drwvc.com/">DRW Venture Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.av.vc/">Alumni Ventures</a>, and <a href="https://jumpcap.com/">Jump Capital</a> also participated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago-based company, which launched in April 2020, raised a $1 million seed round in September 2020. The latest round brings its total funding to “just shy of $40 million,” co-founder and CEO Joel Birch told TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the funds to double its 40-person employee base in the next six to eight months and invest in user acquisition, growth and marketing. Until this fundraise, Stacked had grown its business with no formal marketing spend, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked has automated over $10 billion worth of transactions for tens of thousands of new investors in 2021, per the company. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also secured status as a registered investment advisor (RIA) with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) this summer in preparation to widen its product offerings, the company told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the very near future, we&#8217;re going to continue to evolve our platform away from automating strategies and giving people this easy investment platform into actually offering structured products like risk-adjusted portfolios and giving curated investment advice to individuals based on their risk tolerance,” Birch said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the SEC has not yet approved a crypto ETF for trading in the U.S., products like Grayscale’s trusts have become popular with investors seeking price exposure to the asset class. Birch said Stacked’s product differs from those sorts of products in that it is available to all retail investors, regardless of whether they are accredited, and allows users to hold custody of their digital assets. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked, which acts as a layer on top of a user’s existing crypto brokerage account, offers a range of pre-built portfolios it calls “stacks” based on a risk score it assigns to each user after they take a suitability assessment. It partners with “a handful of the most reputable exchanges in the world,” including Coinbase, FTX, and Binance, per Birch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its core product is currently free to use and allows users to manage portfolios across multiple crypto exchanges, auto-rebalance and compound their portfolios, and lend cryptocurrency through FTX’s exchange, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacked makes money by charging a percentage fee on transactions in its two-sided open marketplace, which sells automated trading strategies, according to Birch. Investors use the exchange to buy strategies designed by well-known traders and influencers in the crypto space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the “next few weeks,” the company plans to launch a feature that will allow users to copy any “stack” as a template and customize it by making direct edits, Birch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exchanges are interested in backing Stacked because its users tend to stay active on those exchanges for longer than average, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that you will see more of that in the crypto ecosystem &#8212; exchanges acting as the infrastructure rails,” Birch said. “They have great custody solutions, liquidity, security, all these very complicated things. But the user experience is usually pretty simple, and it&#8217;s a fairly technical product, so I think you&#8217;ll see tons of products continue to get built on top of the infrastructures that exchanges build.”</span></p>
<p>Birch first heard about bitcoin in 2015 while he was working at Grubhub, where he spent nearly five years leading restaurant growth. Once a homeless immigrant, Birch got his start as an entrepreneur launching a dropshipping business at age 17. A self-described &#8220;tech nerd,&#8221; he dropped out of college three times before completing his bachelor&#8217;s degree to explore his interest in building an internet business.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2012 to 2013, we saw major funding [for startups] and saw [Silicon] Valley, really starting to come to fruition,&#8221; Birch said. &#8220;So I started looking at a place I could move to work for a startup. I wanted to integrate myself into the tech ecosystem, so that way, I could one day be a tech founder myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He applied to jobs at startups in Chicago and landed at Grubhub when it had just 13 employees. At Grubhub, he was surrounded by engineers, data scientists, and business operations professionals who supported and mentored him.</p>
<p>Once he learned about bitcoin, he started working on business ideas in the space and got connected with Stacked cofounder Stephen Beavis. According to Birch, &#8220;the rest is history,&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sense, an HR tech startup that helps some of the world’s largest staffing and recruitment agencies timely find and hire talent, has grown its valuation to $500 million in a new financing round, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-headquartered startup has raised $50 million in its Series D financing round, it said. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the financing round, pushing the five-and-a-half-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $90 million. The multiple-fold surge in the valuation comes just six months after Sense closed its Series C round, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p><a href="http://sensehq.com/">Sense</a> focuses on catering to the blue-collar workers and helps firms manage the talent’s entire lifecycle at the firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hiring knowledge workers may take up to six months, but in “this world, where you’re hiring a warehouse packager, companies need him or her to join today,” explained Anil Dharni, co-founder and chief executive of Sense, in an interview with TechCrunch. He declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>The vast majority of professional social networks and other recruitment platforms are currently designed to serve knowledge workers, he said. “But for people like Uber drivers and Amazon warehouse workers, such platforms are not relevant,” he said, describing the challenge.</p>
<p>The startup, which says it uses automation, artificial intelligence, and personalization in its screening processes, has courted over 600 customers including Amazon, Sears, Vaco, and Kenny that use the Sense platform to scale their hiring, he said.</p>
<p>Citing its internal figures, Sense said its customers see an average of a whopping 263% increase in the number of candidates they are able to screen using the platform and reduce the time it takes to fill roles by up to 81%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our latest funding is not only validation of the need for personalized talent engagement in today’s candidate-centric world but is also an accelerant for our platform globally as we help reshape the future of work,” he said.</p>
<p>Sense offers a number of services including chatbots that, Dharni said, help businesses remove biases from their hiring practices.</p>
<p>In the last one and a half years, the startup’s platform has also been used to hire healthcare workers, he said.</p>
<p>Dharni got the idea to launch Sense after facing challenges in hiring talent at his previous firms, said Dharni, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/10/anil-dharni-gre/">co-founded gaming firm Funzio,</a> which was acquired by GREE for $210 million.</p>
<p>“We realized that talent is what makes or breaks a company. If you can’t attract the right people, your company is not going to be successful. It doesn’t matter what your TAM [total addressable market] or business model is,” he said.</p>
<p>“It was with that realization that I decided that the next startup we are going to do, it’s going to be around solving for the talent space,” he said.</p>
<p>Dharni said Sense is going after a $200 billion opportunity that remains largely untapped.</p>
<p>Sense has also more than doubled its revenue and employee headcount in the past one year. The startup now plans to expand Sense’s offerings in several markets including the Western Europe, he said.</p>
<p>“We believe the critical nature of the Sense platform in enabling enterprise customers to find and hire quality talent faster has been clear. As it expands both nationally and globally, we have no doubt in their ability to positively transform how companies build great teams and compete,” said Sumer Juneja, Managing Partner of SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p class="p1">While Elon Musk has shitposted his way to crypto sainthood, Jack Dorsey has been spreading the blockchain gospel far more earnestly than most.</p>
<p class="p1">As CEO of Twitter — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">which he was until Monday when he unexpectedly resigned</a> — the bulk of his most impassioned official communications have not focused on the power of the Twitter platform or even the deep opportunities for his other company — fintech giant Square. The former double-CEO has spent the past year spreading the gospel of bitcoin, and using his multibillion-dollar enterprises to share that same message by pushing crypto-embracing features more aggressively than his peers.</p>
<p class="p1">He hasn’t minced words. “#Bitcoin will unite a deeply divided country. (and eventually: world),” he tweeted in August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">At a bitcoin-centric conference in Miami this year, he was even more lavish with his praise: “For me Bitcoin changes absolutely everything. What I’m drawn to the most about it is the ethos, is what it represents, are the conditions that created it, which are so rare and so special and so precious. I don’t think there’s anything more important in my lifetime to work on and I don’t think there’s anything more enabling for people around the world.”</p>
<p class="p1">His executive fervor led both Twitter and Square toward embracing bitcoin and blockchain-centric features that sit deep inside platforms relied on by millions. In July, Dorsey said that would be a “big part” of the company’s future. Recent initiatives at Square have included a hardware wallet to store bitcoin and the exploration of building a dedicated bitcoin mining system.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jack Dorsey says bitcoin will be a big part of Twitter&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/embed/#?secret=pnLGrbuEs0" data-secret="pnLGrbuEs0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p1">For platforms with a multitude of unsolved and often pressing issues, Dorsey’s seemingly unilateral public focus on the revolutionary power of bitcoin hasn’t always sat well with onlookers, who already worried whether his status as a dual-CEO meant he was less in-tune with the needs of his individual companies. Early last year, activist-investor hedge fund Elliott Management issued a list of demands to Twitter — chief of which was that Dorsey would step down &#8212; after quietly bulking up a sizable stake in the company.</p>
<p class="p1">Dorsey’s announcement that he was resigning as CEO of Twitter sent the company’s stock soaring Monday. While some rejoiced that Twitter may meet its full potential under a full-time CEO, others speculated on what Dorsey was doing and whether he might be leaving Twitter to start a “web3” company focused solely on bitcoin and blockchain-based technologies. It seems that rather than spin up a new company from scratch, Dorsey has aimed to rethink the existing stack of opportunities inside his other company, Square. On Wednesday, he announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">sweeping rebrand</a>, renaming the fintech company initially known for its little plastic credit card dongles, as Block, a not-so-subtle nod to CEO/founder Dorsey’s deepening infatuation with the blockchain.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike the public companies of yesteryear, which could juice their stock price by adding “Blockchain” to their company name, Square is no penny stock — it’s worth nearly $90 billion already. At this point, it’s worth noting that Square has explicitly indicated that there will not be a wide reorganization accompanying rebrand, though Square Crypto is getting its own brand — <i>Spiral</i>. That said, it’s difficult not to read between the lines, given Dorsey’s bitcoin boosterism and the recent Square initiatives, like hardware wallets and mining rigs, which could re-position the company as crypto-first.</p>
<p class="p1">In many ways, Block’s hodgepodge of properties, including music streaming app Tidal and the Cash App, seems like a potential full-stack web3 empire, or it could just mean the opportunity to piss off an awful lot of different stakeholders by haphazardly weaving crypto technologies into products that don’t need them.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p>Here are a few stories this week I think you should take a closer look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/"><b>UK antitrust watchdog orders Meta to sell off Giphy</b></a><br />
Facebook, now Meta, has found itself in a regulatory environment that may leave it struggling to carry out M&amp;A business as usual. The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has ordered Meta to reverse its acquisition of gif giant Giphy and sell off the startup. &#8220;The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market. Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs,&#8221; one of the group&#8217;s leaders said in a statement.</p>
<p>Facebook may have changed its name to disguise consumer distaste for their corporate brand, but its regulatory problems aren&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/facebooks-top-crypto-executive-david-marcus-is-leaving-the-company/"><b>Facebook&#8217;s top crypto exec leaves company</b></a><br />
Facebook&#8217;s top cryptocurrency expert is leaving the company after years of plotting an ambitious entrance for the company into the crypto world. David Marcus, a long-time crypto supporter, previously led the company&#8217;s Messenger app team. His departure marks another major exit by a long-time Facebook executive — in September, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer announced he was stepping down from his role after 13 years at the company.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most influential execs in the crypto space, Marcus was unable to get too much out the door at Facebook due to regulatory pressure. He indicated in his announcement that he is looking toward entrepreneurial pursuits next.</p>

</b>Twitter&#8217;s new CEO found himself in hot water just a day into his tenure as user backlash mounted against the company&#8217;s new safety policies. The policies, which were framed as a way to prevent harassment and abuse, outlaw sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent. “When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it,” Twitter said in its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>. “This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very broad rule that&#8217;s certain to lead to further controversy. Twitter clearly received more backlash than expected; whether this leads to unexpected consequences in implementation is the broader question.</p>

&#8220;&#8230;We are not only seeing software stocks flirt with bear-market territory in technical terms, but also a pretty notable pullback in the value of even the <em>fastest-growing</em> technology companies. This means that public valuation multiples — key indicators for yet-private unicorns and younger startups — are shrinking. Have valuations shifted enough to slow the current venture capital bonanza? Probably not. But we could be closer to that tipping point than you’d think&#8230;&#8221;</p>

&#8220;&#8230;Companies can’t let how they’ve hired in the past influence their approach today — doing so means missing not just the quantity of developers, but the quality and diversity of them.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The killer app of any tech is to make your life easier and more comfortable; the GPS in your car helps you find the best route to a restaurant when traffic is backed up, if you have cruise control, you can set a speed on the highway to ensure that you don&#8217;t get a ticket. These vehicle features are modern-day must-haves, yet because these complex systems are so instrumental to our daily lives, we only think about them when they&#8217;re not working or, in the case of the Rebelle Rally, blocked for competition.</p>
<p>Competitors in the Rebelle Rally &#8212; the annual off-road navigational competition for women &#8212; got to play test engineer for eight days, an experience that provided a deep understanding of what automotive-grade really means, all while competing to find hidden checkpoints in the desert for points.</p>
<p>Running a high-tech product at or near its limit in a tech-adverse environment is one way that auto manufacturers test vehicles during pre-production. Car manufacturers travel all over the world to places with extreme weather and temperatures to test vehicles to ensure that the vehicle in your driveway can withstand everything from sub-zero temperatures, snow, mud, and rain to intense heat, sand, and wind, all while running at or near the limit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet, it&#8217;s a part of the process that very few even consider — that is until you&#8217;re in the middle of a sandstorm or navigating across a desert, both of which I faced while behind the wheel of a 2020 Porsche Cayenne S. That experience showed just how robust automotive-grade is, and gave me a tiny taste of the kind of testing that these vehicles go through before they&#8217;re put into the hands of consumers.</p>
<h2>Competing in the extreme</h2>
<p>The Rebelle Rally is part geocaching and part off-roading competition that takes place in a variety of settings across the western desert in the United States each October. It was created by veteran rally driver and navigator, Emily Miller and 2021 marks its sixth year. Miller has said that she started the rally specifically for stock vehicles&#8211;or those that have not been modified to tackle rugged off-road terrain, as a way for women to really test the limits of the vehicle in their driveway.</p>
<p>Each day of the competition, 52 teams set out to find hidden geofenced checkpoints littered across the landscape using nothing more than paper maps, handheld compasses, and map rulers to locate them. Some checkpoints have visible flags, while others have no marker whatsoever, and each checkpoint has a specific open and closing time.</p>
<p>Competitors use a hand-held GPS locator, an Iridium Yellow Brick tracking device, to check in at each checkpoint and earn points which are based on a variety of factors, including location, level of off-road driving difficulty, and accuracy or how close they get to the correct geofenced point. At the end of the competition, the team with the most points takes the podium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This year the competition covered more than 1,500 miles of off-road trails in California, Arizona, and Nevada, and manufacturers like Porsche, Rivian, Volkswagen, Jeep, Nissan, and Toyota often put teams of women into OEM-owned vehicles to show just how capable their crossovers, SUVs, and trucks are. This year, eleven manufacturer-sponsored teams competed.</p>
<p>The competition was a first for me and Porsche North America.</p>
<p>According to Miller, the rally is &#8220;designed as a proving ground. We have some [companies] that have engineers participating so they can literally live and compete in the vehicles they design, some that see it as an authentic, hard-core test drive for journalists, employee development, customer opportunities and incentives. And the content collected comes from some of the most scenic landscapes anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s event posed a more difficult challenge than in years past as a result of the weather.</p>
<p>We endured extremes that ranged from lows in the 30s with rain, snow, and sleet to a tremendous sandstorm that lasted 24 hours at Big Dune, near Beatty, Nevada. Overnight, during that storm, gusts reached upwards of 60 mph, created total white-out conditions, and forced most of the competitors, including my teammate Beth Bowman and I, to sleep in our vehicles as a safety precaution.</p>
<p>The wind and blowing sand shredded and destroyed tents and caused an extremely unsafe condition for the fuel truck, which normally provides the 50-plus competitors with fuel each night.</p>
<p>Those are just the kind of weather conditions that people like Ralf Bosch, the director of Cayenne testing at Porsche, celebrate when testing a vehicle. &#8220;Sand is a terrible torture for a modern vehicle. There&#8217;s lots of cooling, clutches and drive shafts that have to be specially designed so that they don&#8217;t break down in the dunes,&#8221; Bosch said.</p>
<p>Bosch and his team travel all over the world — from Finland to Africa — to test prototype Cayennes, both combustion and hybrid-powered, in extreme weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look for extreme cold, for extreme wet and drizzly and salty weather, extreme temperatures with mud and snow, to be sure that these conditions don&#8217;t affect the car too much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We drive the vehicles for days in sand storms, and then we pack them in snow and ice and cold until everything is frozen and aim to have no fault indications.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s highly unlikely that an owner will ever take their Cayenne to the wilds of Yellowknife in Canada, a popular and extreme winter testing site for auto manufacturers, this kind of rigorous testing is a regular practice in the industry. This testing helps carmakers ensure that the technology, both inside and out, is automotive grade. That means that everything from the GPS in your vehicle, the auto/stop-start system, to the engine or motor, will run in all kinds of conditions&#8211;especially at the extremes&#8211;without breaking down or failing completely.</p>
<h2>The tech: a double-edged sword</h2>

<p>The Rebelle Rally poses unique challenges for modern vehicles, especially as they become even more tech-laden. Since GPS and digital compasses are not allowed in the Rebelle, our Cayenne S, which we nicknamed Ruby after its scarlet interior, went through an extensive process shepherded by Porsche to ensure that the navigation system was totally confused and showed the incorrect data in order to meet the rules and regulations of the competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to disable the GPS capabilities on the Cayenne S, we removed all antennas (GPS, GSM and WiFi), and additionally programmed the PCM to only search for non-U.S. satellites so it would not connect to our U.S. based satellite network,&#8221; Kyle Milliken, the Porsche press fleet technician who worked the system, said.</p>
<p>That meant that the entire time we were driving in remote areas of the desert, the system thought we were somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, and its digital compass was completely useless.</p>
<p>Like most modern vehicles, our Cayenne S had one single screen that controlled everything from climate to ride height and traction. Those last two features are absolutely crucial when taking on any challenging off-road trail in an all-wheel-drive vehicle, as you need to be able to actively manage and control ride height and power distribution. Had Porsche not adequately confused the GPS, the Rally would have physically blocked our access to that screen, rendering us unable to do much more than put the car in drive, reverse, park and neutral.</p>

<p>Unlike the first-generation Cayenne, which has a rightful reputation as an off-road beast (as it had a robust chassis and came complete with locking differentials and a transfer case accessed through physical buttons), a modern Cayenne&#8217;s off-road features and programs can only be accessed through the main center console screen.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you must be able to access the screen (and its menus) to change a tire on a modern Cayenne S outfitted with air suspension, as Ruby was. You have to turn off the auto-leveling feature that makes the Cayenne comfortable on-road and off to jack the car up. Had the Rally blocked our screen because of the GPS, we&#8217;d have had a far more difficult time competing.</p>
<p>Some of the very good off-road settings that come with the air suspension on the Cayenne S (my favorites were Sand and Rocks with the chassis height on Terrain) got a little too smart during our version of torture testing.</p>
<p>While training in the Oceano Dunes in late August, Beth and I struggled to get intentionally stuck in the soft sand so we could practice the self-rescue skills we would need in the Rally. The traction control system on the Cayenne would override and stop the wheel spin when I gunned it to dig us in on that training. Luckily, during the Rally itself, we never got stuck — nor did I blow a tire or break anything on the vehicle. The Cayenne proved to be so solid that we even rescued another vehicle that got stuck in the Glamis Dunes.</p>

<p>All of this is a testament to the robustness of the extreme testing that goes into the development of automotive-grade technology and components, particularly those in the modern Cayenne. Despite a massive sandstorm (plus two more small ones that pelted us over the eight-day stint), extremely harsh environments, and tricky driving, the Cayenne S performed just as expected every single day.</p>
<p>Each morning, Ruby purred to life, kept us comfortable and warm (or cool), and never threw a single fault. We never had to blow out the air filter or brakes and drove straight from the eerie Glamis dunes onto the highway and back to the chaos of Los Angeles, doing nothing more than adding air back to the 20-inch tires we ran on.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s precisely what &#8220;automotive grade,&#8221; testing is designed to do&#8211;keep you on the road no matter what kind of weather or environment you&#8217;re facing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s so good on the road, you think that it can&#8217;t be that good in such a sandy and dirty condition,&#8221; As Bosch said. &#8220;We try to keep the off-road performance by improving the on-road performance in the Cayenne and it&#8217;s a very capable vehicle.&#8221;</p>
