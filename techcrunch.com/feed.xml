</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the early 2000s, most business-critical software was hosted on privately run data centers. But with time, enterprises overcame their skepticism and moved critical applications to the cloud.</p>
<p>DevOps fueled this shift to the cloud, as it gave decision-makers a sense of control over business-critical applications hosted outside their own data centers.</p>
<p>Today, enterprises are in a similar phase of trying out and accepting machine learning (ML) in their production environments, and one of the accelerating factors behind this change is MLOps.</p>
<p>Similar to cloud-native startups, many startups today are ML native and offer differentiated products to their customers. But a vast majority of large and midsize enterprises are either only now just trying out ML applications or just struggling to bring functioning models to production.</p>
<p>Here are some key challenges that MLOps can help with:</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s hard to get cross-team ML collaboration to work</h2>
<p>An ML model may be as simple as one that predicts churn, or as complex as the one determining Uber or Lyft pricing between San Jose and San Francisco. Creating a model and enabling teams to benefit from it is an incredibly complex endeavor.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The MLOps space is in its early days today, but it has massive potential because it allows organizations to bring AI to production environments in a fraction of the time it takes today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to requiring a large amount of labeled historic data to train these models, multiple teams need to coordinate to continuously monitor the models for performance degradation.</p>
<p>There are three core roles involved in ML modeling, but each one has different motivations and incentives:</p>
<p><strong>Data engineers:</strong> Trained engineers excel at gleaning data from multiple sources, cleaning it and storing it in the right formats so that analysis can be performed. Data engineers play with tools like ETL/ELT, data warehouses and data lakes, and are well versed in handling static and streaming data sets. A high-level data pipeline created by a data engineer might look like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232051" style="width: 1828px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232051" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232051 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png" alt="data pipeline" width="1818" height="974" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png 1818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=1536,823 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Data-Pipeline.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1818px) 100vw, 1818px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ashish Kakran, Thomvest Ventures</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Data scientists:</strong> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These are the experts who can run complex regressions in their sleep. Using common tools like the Python language, Jupyter Notebooks and Tensorflow, data scientists take the data provided by data engineers and analyze it, which results in a highly accurate model. Data scientists love trying different algorithms and comparing these models for accuracy, but after that someone needs to do the work to bring the models to production.</span></p>
<p><strong>AI engineers/DevOps engineers:</strong> These are specialists who understand infrastructure, can take models to production and if something goes wrong, can quickly detect the issue and kickstart the resolution process.</p>
<p>MLOps enables these three critical personas to continuously collaborate to deliver successful AI implementations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The proliferation of ML tools</h2>
<p>In the new developer-led, bottom-up world, teams can choose from a plethora of tools to solve their problems.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short-form video apps have seen major successes, like TikTok, as well as dramatic failures, like Quibi. Now, a new app called <a href="https://www.marmelapp.com/snax?shortlink=presslaunch&amp;pid=Press&amp;c=Launch">Snax</a> wants to offer a twist on the popular vertical video format by giving users a way to not just watch mini-movies on their mobile devices, but also interact with them. The subscription streaming service in Snax includes a growing catalog of original movies which combine traditional storytelling elements with interactive gaming. Users may be asked to solve a puzzle to help move the story forward, look for clues in a murder mystery scene, make a choice for the characters in a choose-your-own-adventure mode, engage with 360-degree video elements, and more.</p>
<p>The idea for this new type of interactive movie experience comes from the Paris-based app developers at <a href="https://www.notion.so/marmelapp/Mission-Culture-98e927d4192c4008856ac951690aba6a">Marmelapp</a>, co-founded by Alan Keiss, Stéphane Fort, and Jérôme Boé. To date, the company has launched 15 apps totaling over 30 million downloads and generates double-digits millions (in euros) per year across its apps.</p>
<p>Marmelapp&#8217;s more recent titles include the party game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picolo-party-game/id1001473964">Picolo</a> and the text-based choose-your-own-adventure app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blaze-make-your-own-choices/id1454233880">Blaze</a>. The latter actually served as the starting point for Snax, we&#8217;re told.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We really enjoyed [Blaze] and got some great feedback. We developed and published 75 original stories on there,&#8221; explains Snax&#8217;s Head of Content, James Davies. &#8220;That was actually quite a lot content because, with all the branching paths, we had multiple endings,&#8221; he notes. The team later realized that Blaze could be a lot more fun if it included more than just text &#8212; like mini-films to go along with its stories. They initially thought to try to incorporate that concept into Blaze, but it became too complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became pretty clear to us that it needed to be a separate project,&#8221;  Davies says. That&#8217;s how, around 18 months ago, Snax began its development.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236650" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236650" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236650" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236650" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>Today, the app features a collection of bite-sized movies (hence the name &#8220;Snax) which are meant to be watched as vertical videos. Each episode lasts about 3 to 5 minutes long, and includes stopping points where the user is meant to engage with the content in some way. They may need to solve a puzzle or a brain teaser. They may need to make a choice or find a hidden item in the room. They may need to text with a character. And so on. (Don&#8217;t worry, if you&#8217;re stumped, there is a &#8220;hint&#8221; option.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users will sometimes do more than just tap on a choice. For example, in one murder mystery movie, you&#8217;re presented with a text box where you write in your answer, freeform. To make this feature work, Snax developed a database of possible answers and their potential misspellings, so it would be able to determine when the user got it right.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236652" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236652" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236652" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236652" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>The movies themselves are also higher-production quality than you might expect from an entertainment app like this.</p>
<p>Snax explains its seven-person team handles script development and adding the interactive features, but works with professional filmmakers and partnered production companies to create the video content. Currently, these shoots cost in the ballpark of $100,000 euros per project, but Snax is working to streamline production costs by filming more series back-to-back with the same team on different scripts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236648" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236648" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2236648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snax</p></div></p>
<p>The filmmakers don&#8217;t share in the subsequent subscription revenue the app generates, but are paid upfront. At launch, Snax is charging $4.99/week, $8.49/mo, or $47.99/year for its subscription service. (You can watch a couple of episodes for free to try it out, though).</p>
<p>The company began by offering Snax in France earlier this year, but just introduced the app to English-speaking audiences in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia in October. For now, the app features French movies that are dubbed in English, but the long-term strategy is to now start producing content in the English language as well as Spanish.</p>
<p>Since its launch, about half of Snax user base is now in an English-language market and the team expects this to rise to as much as 90% in the near future.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2236658" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gameplay-Img9.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>Snax users tend to be young, in the 18 to 24-year-old age demographic, and evenly split between male and female. So far, Snax has found that U.S. users, in particular, seem to be more engaged with talking about and sharing the app, and with the app&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We noticed that American men and women are a lot more engaged in the content than French users &#8212; the uptake of people completing episodes or completing stories&#8230;is considerably higher than it has been in France,&#8221; says Davies. &#8220;That means we need to be producing things for a North American audience.</p>
<p>While some of its earlier movies were with unknown actors, Snax is now ramping up production with higher-profile stars in France, including France&#8217;s third-largest YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NormanFaitDesVideos">Norman</a>, actor and comedian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ludovik">Ludovik</a>, and actor Bastien Ughetto. It plans to do more of this as it expands in the U.S.</p>
<p>Snax is now working on adding more variety to its interactions to make them more exciting and more involved. It&#8217;s also further developing its own internal software used for formatting its scripts.</p>
<p>Marmelapp plans to spin out Snax as its own company in 2022, and may consider fundraising at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;We currently support 13 languages for captions, with more on the way. These 13 languages include: English, Cantonese, Mandarin Chinese, Yue Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Turkish,&#8221; a Clubhouse representative told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>One user <a href="https://twitter.com/PamFR/status/1461158253866323968">reported on Twitter</a> that Spanish live captioning worked in one room, but in another, the Spanish speech was transcribed as English gibberish. An engineer at Clubhouse <a href="https://twitter.com/juberti/status/1461193729918713860">replied</a> that this means the language detection might not have worked, so it seems that the app is still learning how to distinguish among non-English languages in beta.</p>
<p>Clubhouse has rolled out a number of features recently like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/clubhouse-announces-wave-making-it-easier-to-start-casual-private-rooms/">Wave</a>, which makes it easier to start a conversation with a friend, replays for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">asynchronous</a> listening, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/">recorded rooms</a>. Recorded rooms help the app compete with startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a> and <a href="https://spacepod.studio/">Space Pod</a>, which seek to help creators turn live audio recordings into widely-distributed podcasts. But live captioning has been a glaring omission since the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">initial bout</a> of popularity. Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t have an estimate of when closed captioning will roll out on Android, but hopefully it won&#8217;t be long.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

New <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-appoints-kevin-lynch-car-division-223033138.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">project leader Kevin Lynch</a> wants the very first model to drive itself, the insiders said.</p>
<p>The company is reportedly speeding up its plans to match. Where Apple had recently targeted a launch in five to seven years, the sources said it was now aiming for 2025, or just four years. The plan is believed to be &#8220;fluid,&#8221; however, and revolves around Apple completing its full autonomous system on time. Apple supposedly finished much of the &#8220;core work&#8221; on the car&#8217;s processor.</p>
<p>Tipsters also suggested Apple had an &#8220;ideal&#8221; interior in mind with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">lounge-like seating</a> for passengers, a touchscreen infotainment system in the middle and no steering wheel or pedals. An emergency takeover mode has been under discussion, the sources added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple declined to comment. The new priority could help a project that has seen its share of setbacks, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hires-doug-field-204511159.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">departing executives</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-and-kia-are-no-longer-talking-to-apple-about-an-autonomous-ev-083235132.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">skittish partners</a>. The company could match or beat incumbent car manufacturers planning to offer full or near-full autonomy around the same time, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id-buzz-robotaxi-2025-121050899.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">such as VW</a>. However, full self-driving has many challenges, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">difficult-to-predict traffic</a> and weather problems like snow. It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Apple had to delay the car, or at least ask drivers to take over in certain conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To software developers, the process of creating a hardware product can seem distinctly 1980s. Even in the most high-tech of work flows, there are tons of error-prone and potentially expensive manual, steps including spreadsheets, confusion and a general feeling of the will to live sagging away through the musty, solder-stained floorboards of the hardware development shop. Along comes <a href="https://www.durolabs.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duro</a> and the $4 million the company just raised, in an attempt to bring some agile methodology sanity to a <em>final-bill-of-materials.top-assembly.final.final.final.final.no-really-final-this-time.xls</em> world.</p>
<p>Duro&#8217;s fundraising round was led by <a href="https://www.bonfirevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B2B SaaS investors Bonfire Ventures</a>, with follow-on money from <a href="https://riot.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard-tech investors Riot Ventures</a>. The new funding will be used to expand sales and marketing teams and to further develop Duro’s product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a former electrical engineer. For 20 years I designed and manufactured products &#8212; IoT, Drones, telecom equipment, wearables, cleantech, you name it. I got frustrated with how much of my time was being spent managing the most fundamental elements of hardware development: CAD files, your bill of materials and your supply chain data,&#8221; explains Duro&#8217;s CEO Michael Corr. &#8220;There&#8217;s a product category called Product Lifecycle Management &#8212; or PLM &#8212; which is meant to be a receptacle for that information for centralizing and managing it. It includes revision control, and you use it with your own teams, as well as sharing it with your contract manufacturers. And yet none of the tools I used were actually saving time or actually providing value at the end of the day. It&#8217;s all done so manually and is so process-driven that it was often easier to just use spreadsheets. That&#8217;s still the prevalent technology today, because the established tools are just so damn complicated and prone to error, and they&#8217;re not actually providing value.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With an axe to grind against the status quo, co-founders Michael Corr and Kellan O’Connor developed Duro as a cloud platform to centralize all product data and remove the friction of connecting disparate teams and tools. The goal is transparency and giving everyone from the product teams, the engineering teams and the suppliers and manufacturing teams access to the most accurate and most recent data at all times.</p>
<p>&#8220;To simplify things a little, the hardware industry is dominated by a bimodal culture. You have the older generation that came into the workforce in the 80s and 90s, who established these toolsets that we have today. Meanwhile, there is a gap &#8212; young engineers were more interested in learning web, mobile and app development, as it was so much more in vogue. There wasn&#8217;t a continuation of young engineers entering the hardware space,&#8221; Corr outlines the market landscape where Duro is staking out its territory. &#8220;But now they&#8217;re coming back. Hardware has proven itself to be a sexy product. IoT happened, and the cost of developing hardware came down drastically. Now what we are seeing is a wave of a younger generation of engineers that&#8217;s entering the workforce. They are the ones that Duro is going after. They are used to the culture from software development, and they have different standards for the software they use.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, where SaaS, GitHub and dev/ops processes completely changed how software is delivered on an ongoing basis, Duro wants to take similar mechanics and invite the hardware folks to join the current millennium.</p>
<p>&#8220;GitHub did an excellent job of proving that it can be done. You can have a single cloud-hosted source of your source code control, and then you build an ecosystem of tools and people and tasks around it. And everyone&#8217;s always pointing to GitHub. In the hardware industry, traditionally, that hasn&#8217;t been the case. You have multiple teams, doing their disparate responsibilities: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, procurement, manufacturing, etc. Because there hasn&#8217;t been a concept of centralizing it, everybody has their own copy of the data,&#8221; explains Corr. &#8220;Everybody has their own separate copy of the bill materials, for example, and that creates a problem. It creates this additional necessity of overhead to manage all those communication channels and making sure that everybody has the latest copy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re incredibly excited to partner with Duro, which is bringing a fresh solution to a big market dominated by old companies. When a startup like Duro lowers the barrier to entry for a whole new set of users, it positions them to get the lion’s share of that new addressable market,&#8221; said Jim Andelman, co-founder and managing director at Bonfire Ventures. &#8220;Customer affinity for Duro’s platform is off the charts: it’s clear to us that this is the PLM solution of choice for engineering-driven businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the product itself, the company is innovating on its business model, taking a leaf out of the SaaS playbook.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of friction in software sales for hardware in the past. Very expensive applications, driven by user-license business models. And there are rarely trials available &#8212; if you want to use it, you just have to pay for and just accept what you get. So Duro innovates a little bit there too. We have three subscription packages. The starter package allows companies who know that spreadsheets are not a good solution and want to get into properly managed data, centralized and controlled environments. The Pro version works right out of the box, without the complex configuration and setup needed by other products. It&#8217;s designed for teams who are at the cusp of doing its first round of production, and want to do proper revision control interface with their suppliers,&#8221; explains Corr. &#8220;Our enterprise package is more the expansive package for teams that have outgrown those lower two tiers, or that are just more established and they have existing workflows.</p>
<p>The starter package is $450 a month or $5,400 a year. The Pro package weighs in at $750 per month or around $9,000 per year. The enterprise package is a little bit more open ended, depending on the needs of the customer. The Duro team told me that they have contracts ranging from $25,000 to $100,000, depending on how the software is configured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given our extensive experience investing in full-stack businesses, we know that issues surrounding data continuity are synonymous with hardware manufacturing and weigh heavily on the industry,&#8221; said Will Coffield, co-founder and general partner at Riot Ventures. &#8220;We love Duro’s approach to modernizing hardware design/development, using automation to replace manual processes and connect teams to information for intelligent and efficient collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Belkin has a new 3-in-1 wireless charger that&#8217;s tailor made for iPhone and Apple Watch owners, and that also provides MagSafe 15W charging speeds for iPhone 12 and 13, along with fast charging for the latest Apple Watch 7 series. Belikin also introduce a new standalone portable fast charger for Apple Watch that includes an integrated USB-C cable and also offers fast charge compatibility for Series 7 models.</p>
<p>The Belkin &#8220;<a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/p-wiz016/">BOOST↑CHARGE PRO 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad</a>&#8221; which is too much of a mouthful and will henceforth be referred to as the 3-in-1 charger, has a MagSafe 15W wireless charger for your iPhone as mentioned. It also includes a standard Qi-compatible wireless charging pad that you can use to power up your AirPods, and there&#8217;s an adjustable Apple Watch charging puck that supports fast charging as mentioned above. The adjustability of the Watch puck is a nice touch, giving you freedom to charge either lying flat or upright in Apple Watch&#8217;s &#8216;nightstand mode,&#8217; and there&#8217;s a clever switch underneath that allows you to tweak the height of the stand to perfectly fit Apple Watch models new and old, as well as a side variety of Apple Watch cases if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>The stand is covered in a rubberized silicone so you don&#8217;t need to worry about inadvertently scratching any of your gadgets as you fumble in the night, and it&#8217;s all powered by just a single cord that plugs into an included 40W power adapter. I&#8217;ve been using this for about a week now, and can confidently say it&#8217;s the best option out there for a one-cord, max speed bedside charging solution for Apple fans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s $149.95, sold via both Belkin&#8217;s own website and Apple&#8217;s, and goes on sale starting today.</p>
<p>The Belkin &#8220;<a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/p/p-wiz015/">BOOST↑CHARGE PRO Portable Fast Charger</a>&#8221; (again, terrible, so let&#8217;s just call it the Watch charger) is an awesome alternative to Apple&#8217;s own little standalone pillow charger for Apple Watch. Thanks to the integrated cable it&#8217;s super portable for travel, and again features adjustability to fit various Watch models and cases, as well as offering both flat and upright nightstand charging. Plus, you get the fast charging feature if you have a Series 7. Definitely the charger to beat when it comes to dedicated Apple Watch kit.</p>
<p>The Watch charger is just $59.95, which is a steal relative to Apple&#8217;s own dedicated magnetic charging dock, and also is available to order starting today at both Belkin.com and Apple.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An electric vehicle is, essentially, just ‘software on wheels’, and requires lots of moving parts, not physical but, of course, virtual. That software needs to continually optimize the performance, efficiency, and safety of the EV it’s running. But a problem has arisen: Not enough auto-makers unpack their software for others to help improve it. So, the more this embedded automotive software is de-coupled from the underlying electronic hardware, the more this optimization can take place, and the more efficient vehicles can become. That has important implications for things like battery range and performance overall.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason why UK-based <a href="https://eatron.com/">Eatron</a>, which makes this ‘intelligent automotive software’, has managed to attract an $11 million Series-A funding round led by the UK&#8217;s MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Also participating was Aster Capital and Vietnamese Carmaker VinFast. Eatron has previously collaborated with Vinfast on its range of electric cars. The startup also has a strategic partnership with the Hirschvogel Group from German, which invested $1.5M</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236589" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology enables OEMs and Tier-1s to de-couple automotive software from its hardware for the purposes of battery management, intelligent motion control, and advanced driver assistance. This has the effect of increasing supplier choice for OEMs and reduces cost, risks and time to market, says the company.</p>
<p>Part of the Series-A funding will be used to expand the platform with additional partnerships for third-party software modules and semiconductor and hardware component suppliers. It will also grow its sales teams in Germany, India and USA.</p>
<p>Dr Umut Genc, co-founder and CEO at Eatron said: “Mobility and Automotive in particular, is in the middle of a dramatic transformation and as part of this change needs to become a software-driven industry. An intelligent automotive software platform, embedded at the edge and connected to the cloud, will play a critical role in this transformation.” <br />

Mina Samaan, Investor at MMC Ventures said: “We have seen many software businesses building interesting algorithmic concepts to support OEMs, but none have had the expertise to meet the regulatory, security and safety requirements for automotive production. Eatron is the exception. Its software has been built from the ground up to be automotive grade and has the potential to drive the battery and autonomy features in hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the coming years.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://partyround.com/">Party Round</a> is building software that it hopes will make the process of raising early-stage corporate capital far simpler than it is today. And the company just used its own service to raise $7 million.</p>
<p>A host of names took part in the, well, <em>party round</em>, including <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six fund</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/illscience">Anish Acharya from a16z</a>, along with checks from groups like <a href="https://www.shrug.vc/">Shrug Capital</a>. Angels took part as well, including writers-um-investors <a href="https://twitter.com/packyM">Packy McCormick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, and well-known folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/emiliemc">Emilie Choi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsharma">Nik Sharma</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s view, as detailed by Party Round CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-hays-559199113/">Jordi Hays</a> during an interview, is that tech founders have disrupted many methods of investing, but not the way that they raise capital themselves. His startup wants to work on the problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236416" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Per Hays, even using a modern fundraising structure like a SAFE doesn&#8217;t preclude a startup from dealing with lots of back-and-forths over documents, lawyers and tracking wire transfers. As the old saw goes &#8212; that startup fundraising is a distraction is rooted in reality &#8212; Party Round could be onto something by wanting to lower the overall friction present in raising capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days. Party Round is focused on automating seed deals today. Its service has founders create a round, set terms and invite investors to participate. It then helps handle the requisite documents, signatures and capture of raised funds. Smaller checks than are normally considered economically viable &#8212; lawyers are expensive, as is CEO time &#8212; can be accepted, Hays said, opening up the investor pool to one&#8217;s larger network instead of merely the already wealthy.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share much in the way of metrics, a somewhat standard level of disclosure for early-stage companies. But it did say that during a beta period, a collection of founders raised in the low six figures per day using its service.</p>
<p>Which, today, is free. The startup will monetize later on, with Hays saying that there are a number of ways for it to do so. Normally I&#8217;d protest at delayed monetization, but given that Party Round intends to sit atop an artery of capital, it should be able to tap the vein to feed itself when it chooses to. Close proximity to money, and especially money in motion, is never a bad place to build a business.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s fun that Party Round calls itself Party Round. After all, the phrase &#8220;party round&#8221; used to sport a skein of sophisticated investor disapproval. The argument from years ago was that if a company raised a bunch of little checks, a lack of a traditional venture lead would leave the company adrift if it ran into trouble. How things change!</p>
<h2>How do you get corporate software to go viral?</h2>
<p>Party Round stood out from the regular deluge of startup fundraising events not because its own capital raise is a meta-proof point of its model, but because the company is good at culture. By that, I mean I was actually aware of Party Round far in advance of it getting ahold of TechCrunch, even if we didn&#8217;t know it at the time.</p>
<p>The startup has put together a series of viral events, products that it calls <a href="https://partyround.com/drops">drops</a>. Before talking to Hays, I had already seen Party Round&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://helpfulvcs.com/">helpful VCs</a>&#8221; NFT drop in the wild, as well as <a href="https://bigtechfellowship.com/">its dare</a> for employees at major tech companies to quit and found their own company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236428" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236428" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236428 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="218" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png 851w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?resize=150,48 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?resize=768,246 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?resize=680,218 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-7.56.44-AM.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236428" class="wp-caption-text">Hey wait I used to work with one of these JPEGs! <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Party Round</p></div></p>
<p>The startup is good at making noise, which could help the company keep a steady flow of new founders looking to raise entering its front door, and at a low cost to acquire, we&#8217;d reckon.</p>
<p>I am in favor of any service that makes the process of raising capital for business formation simpler because it could help make the startup world more equitable. In theory, at least.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how Party Round turns some early momentum and earned hype into funding volume for its users, how quickly it can add more products &#8212; SPVs, later-stage checks, debt, the possibilities are broad &#8212; and when it starts to ask for payment for its services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most of the world&#8217;s industries, sustainability is an exercise in correcting the mistakes of the past — from changing mindsets to the very machinery used.</p>
<p>But for the fledgling cannabis industry, there is still hope. A slew of startups and industry bodies are trying to make sure that for once, an industry starts off on the right path.</p>
<p>“What I have seen across Fortune 500 companies is, they&#8217;re trying to improve efficiency to reduce the environmental impact of operations that already exist,&#8221; said Annie Davis, vice president of marketing for Flow Cannabis Co, an outdoor cannabis cultivator. &#8220;But what if, from the start, we could build a different model?”</p>
<p>That would be ideal. However, even though cannabis as a legal business is only about a decade old, it still has a long history of illegal cultivation that set a precedent of avoiding the cops rather than saving the planet. Moreover, that has meant that cannabis cultivation has missed out on the massive advancements in traditional agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The agricultural research that’s related to cannabis is anecdotal and driven from its history as an illegal product. It hasn’t benefited from the level of research that traditional agricultural products have,&#8221; said Shawn Cooney, co-founder of the <a href="https://www.sustainablecannabiscoalition.com/">Sustainable Cannabis Coalition</a> (SCC), a coalition of 20 cannabis or cannabis-adjacent companies, including cannabis producer <a href="https://www.trulieve.com/">Trulieve</a> and Flow Cannabis. &#8220;So there’s a history of using less efficient technologies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Hotboxing is bad for the planet</h2>
<p>As of 2020, <a href="https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/2020-state-of-the-industry-report-nexus-greenhouse-systems/">40%</a> of legal cannabis growers cultivate solely indoors, which leaves a huge energy footprint. According to Travis Higginbotham, vice president of production at cannabis retailer and producer <a href="https://shopharborside.com/">Harborside</a>, consumers prefer cannabis that&#8217;s grown indoors, and so it has a higher retail value.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In Colorado, the cannabis industry alone accounts for 1.3% of the state’s total annual emissions, equal to that of coal mining and trash collection.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Cannabis farmers moved inside because they had to hide from law enforcement, Davis said, and those that grew outside planted under the shade of large trees to avoid being spotted by helicopters — not optimal for producing cannabis with high levels of THC. Such early decisions, made when cannabis was illegal, are still influencing consumer preferences and business operations.</p>
<p>The high energy costs associated with growing indoors are the cannabis sector&#8217;s biggest environmental problem — one that is both operational and reputational. Indoor systems use a combination of lights and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to control the climate and simulate ideal conditions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233100" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233100" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2233100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg" alt="Cannabis sustainability" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cannabit-plants.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233100" class="wp-caption-text">Growing cannabis indoors can get very energy-intensive, very quickly. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Harborside</p></div></p>
<p>Together, HVAC, CO2 pumps and lighting account for <a href="https://source.colostate.edu/growing-cannabis-indoors-produces-a-lot-of-greenhouse-gases-just-how-much-depends-on-where-its-grown/">11% to 25%</a> of a facility&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions. What&#8217;s more, HVAC systems in cannabis grow houses work harder than those even in operating rooms because of the heat generated by the grow lights.</p>
<p>What does the overall picture look like? Depending on location, greenhouse gas emissions can range from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00691-w">2,283 kg to 5,184 kg CO2-equivalent</a> for each kilogram of dry flower produced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drug development space is continuing to attract more and more investment. On Thursday, another major player, Generate Biomedicines, announced a $370 million Series B round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is touting a platform-based approach to drug development, but with its own spin: a focus on proteins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate&#8217;s thesis is simple: Rather than making connections between targets and proteins that already exist in nature (or, most often, in scientific data and literature), it aims to understand the big picture &#8212; “foundational principles” about how proteins are made and why they do what they do (which is, basically everything, in the body). The ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to make novel proteins that could one day perform “the majority of life’s functions,” as Mike Nally, the CEO of Generate Biomedicines, told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three years, the company has managed to put such fundamental principles to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been able to generate novel proteins across all protein modalities, and so that includes antibodies, peptides, enzymes and cell and gene therapy,” Nally said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is another one of a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/flagship-pioneering-raises-1-1-billion-to-spend-on-sustainability-and-health-focused-biotech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing cadre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of companies fostered by Flagship Pioneering &#8212; the investor behind Moderna. The company emerged from stealth <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generate-biomedicines-emerges-from-stealth-mode-and-takes-aim-at-covid19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2020</a> with an initial investment of $50 million from the firm, in line with what we’ve seen in other Flagship companies, like the newly launched </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/flagship-pioneerings-new-venture-is-betting-on-trna-to-treat-thousands-of-diseases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This most recent round is Generate Biomedicines&#8217; first significant attempt at external financing. The round will include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska Permanent Fund, Altitude Life Science Ventures, ARCH Venture Partners and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as additional investment from Flagship Pioneering. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Generate Biomedicines seems to have had little trouble generating interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one hand, the company could be benefitting from general trends. Venture capital investment in drug discovery nearly doubled between 2019 and 2020, reaching </span><a href="https://nvca.org/healthcare-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$16.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, investment in AI-based drug development has also snowballed. Per a Stanford University 2020 report, it reached </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-AI-Index-Report_Master.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13.9 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over four times the level of funding in 2019. In August 2021, funding had reached $10.7 billion, per a </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/healthcare-it/total-vc-funding-ai-drug-development-clinical-trials-hits-10-7bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signify Research report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round is large, but isn’t too far off of numbers seen this year for companies occupying a similar space: like Insilico Medicine’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$255 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://cellarity.com/news/cellarity-raises-123-million-in-series-b-funding-to-pioneer-a-new-approach-to-drug-discovery-treating-disease-at-the-level-of-the-cell-as-opposed-to-a-single-molecular-target" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellarity’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (another Flagship Pioneering Company) $123 million Series B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines&#8217; leadership chalks up the size of this round to the company’s new take on protein biology, and protein-based drug development as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therapeutic proteins, particularly monoclonal antibodies, are making up a bigger and bigger share of the drug market. In 2018, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-020-00765-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven of the top 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best-selling drugs were monoclonal antibodies. A 2020 report by </span><a href="https://www.bdo.com/getattachment/92a59a05-185f-4416-a599-7cff17c080f5/attachment.aspx?BPI-The-Therapeutic-Monoclonal-Antibody-Product-Market.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioprocess International Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that global sales of monoclonal antibodies have grown faster than all other biopharmaceuticals in the last five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monoclonal antibodies are perhaps most well-known in the realms of </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oncology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and immunology. But use cases are expanding. For example, monoclonal antibodies, like those manufactured by </span><a href="https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/covid19-treatment-monoclonal-antibodies-infusion-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Lilly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to treat COVID-19, is an example of a therapeutic protein that you’ve likely already heard of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines is focused on all protein modalities, but they have initially focused on developing antibodies, which Nally says make up about 60% of the protein-based biotherapeutics market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, generating antibodies is just part of the picture. The focus on foundational principles of protein function allows for an untapped level of bespoke protein design, adds Molly Gibson, co-founder and chief strategy innovation officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To wrap your head around the scale, think of all the proteins that have been honed by natural selection since the beginning of life. Those proteins only represent a tiny fraction of the total possible proteins that our building blocks of life are capable of forming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of sequence space that nature has sampled through the history of life would equate to almost just a drop of water in all of Earth&#8217;s oceans,” said Gibson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generate Biomedicines&#8217; approach is to use artificial intelligence to understand what other functional proteins we might be capable of making, as opposed to identifying untapped extant proteins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, therapeutic proteins aren’t the easiest drugs to make. </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-research-projects/immunogenicity-protein-based-therapeutics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the immune system </span><a href="http://www.iptonline.com/articles/public/IPTTEN79NoPrint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t exactly been receptive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to novel proteins. Gibson says the company&#8217;s technology can work around this roadblock. She says the company can “co-optimize” for immunogenicity and protein function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to do this, we have developed a proprietary experimental approach to measure and ML approach to learn how proteins are recognized by the immune system, so we can ultimately avoid it,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Generate Biomedicines sees itself as both a drug maker and a platform. The company has several drug candidates in preclinical stages (the focus is infectious disease, oncology and immunology, says Nally). The goal is to pursue Investigational New Drug status by 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Generate Biomedicines&#8217; major upside, per Nally, is that it’s a platform for others to smooth out the process of protein-based drug development in general. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past Nally has indicated that partnerships would be part of Generate Biomedicines&#8217; strategy. But so far, the company hasn’t disclosed any. Though he added the company is looking for partners with deep disease area expertise, or expertise on certain targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round of funding, Generate Biomedicines plans to scale up its workforce to 500 &#8212; the company has 80 employees at the moment. The company is also building two facilities to expand its wet lab, machine learning and data generation capabilities. </span></p>

<p>With this, the company has now raised a total of $257.9 million and its valuation is now north of $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235892" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Expel offers what is essentially a managed security service for cloud applications, infrastructure, networks and endpoints, with its own analysts monitoring a company&#8217;s network 24&#215;7 (and performing remediation if necessary), as well as a preemptive threat hunting service for on-premises and cloud environments. By building what the company calls an &#8220;automation-forward&#8221; system, its systems are able to quickly react to potential issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;These past two years have presented unique challenges that, I think it’s safe to say, most of us couldn’t have anticipated. Yet, during this time we scaled our platform to handle an 82% increase in security events a day, doubled the number of technology partners, more than doubled the number of security investigations, while increasing automation which improved our analyst effectiveness by 260%, all while maintaining an 80+ NPS rating,” said Expel CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemerkel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemerkel/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637253320682000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0PTFuYEBn4KhnNjXmsdsaS">Dave Merkel</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Defending against ransomware, phishing and other emerging threats requires professional management and response, and the need for enterprises to adopt more than just best-in-class MDR has become abundantly clear. <span class="il">Expel</span> is at the forefront of this industry revolution, helping its customers and the security community navigate the complexity of detection and response across on-premise and, increasingly, cloud-based environments,&#8221; said Gene Frantz, general partner at CapitalG and <span class="il">Expel</span> board member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alexa is learning to have more natural conversations. Amazon today <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/conversation-mode-helps-interactions-with-alexa-feel-more-natural" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it&#8217;s rolling out the new &#8220;Conversation Mode&#8221; feature to its Echo Show 10 (3rd Gen.) devices which allows the virtual assistant to engage in free-flowing conversations that don&#8217;t require you to say the wake word, &#8220;Alexa.&#8221; This mode is enabled and disabled by the user via voice commands, so it can be something you only turn on as needed.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazons-alexa-becomes-a-better-conversationalist-and-can-now-ask-you-questions-too/">introduced</a> Alexa Conversations alongside other AI developments at its hardware event last year, where Amazon VP and head scientist Rohit Prasad demoed new Alexa capabilities like its more personalized answers, ability to ask clarifying questions and ability to take natural turns in a conversation.</p>
<p>These types of interactions are easy enough for humans, but present significant challenges for an AI.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At its event, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazons-alexa-becomes-a-better-conversationalist-and-can-now-ask-you-questions-too/">showed off how</a> Conversation Mode could work when two people talked about ordering a pizza.</p>
<p>After enabling the feature by saying, &#8220;Alexa, join our conversation,&#8221; the people discussed their pizza order, at times talking over the virtual assistant. When Alexa landed on the pizza topping they liked, a person said &#8220;that one!&#8221; and Alexa adjusted the order. Alexa <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/25/tech/amazon-alexa-conversational-ai/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also appeared</a> to understand which questions were meant for it versus those that were part of the conversation between the two people, like &#8220;do you think a medium is going to be enough?,&#8221; for example. Then, when one person said they weren&#8217;t that hungry and wanted a smaller pizza, Alexa automatically changed the order.</p>
<p>The company explains Amazon uses a combination of visual and acoustic cues to recognize when customer speech is being directed at the device and whether a reply is expected. This can be a very difficult problem for an AI, as many questions could be meant for either a device or a person, Amazon explains today &#8212; like &#8220;How about a comedy?&#8221; in a conversation about movie selection.</p>
<p>In addition, a conversational mode feature would need to have low latency in order to more accurately detect the start of an utterance meant for Alexa. (Typically, a wake word triggers Alexa to listen.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Amazon says it developed a method for visual device directedness by estimating the head orientation of each person in the device&#8217;s field of view.</p>
<p>&#8220;We trained a deep-neural-network model to infer the coefficients of the templates for a given input image and to determine the orientation of the head in the image,&#8221; the company shares <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/new-alexa-feature-enables-natural-multiparty-interactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an Amazon Science blog post</a>, offering a high-level view of the AI technology. &#8220;Then we quantized the weights of the model, to reduce its size and execution time. In our experiments, this approach reduced the false-rejection rate (FRR) for visual device directedness detection by almost 80% relative to the [standard perspective-n-point] approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon also uses an audio-based device voice activity detection (DVAD) model to process the audio cues that signal whether or not Alexa should respond to speech it&#8217;s hearing. By adding this to the visual-only mode, Amazon was able to reduce false wakes due to ambient noise by 80% and cut down false wakes triggered by Alexa&#8217;s own responses by 42%, without increasing latency, it says.</p>
<p>To use Conversation Mode, users can say, &#8220;Alexa, join the conversation.&#8221; When enabled, there&#8217;s a solid blue border around the Echo Show 10 screen, and a light blue bar at the bottom of the screen, which lets you know when your requests are being sent to the cloud. When you&#8217;re finished, you can exit by saying, &#8220;Leave the conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexa will also automatically exit the mode if there&#8217;s no more interaction for a short period of time.</p>
<p>The company has been working on this conversational development for some time.</p>
<p>In July 2020, it presented <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/introducing-alexa-conversations-beta-a-new-ai-driven-approach-to-providing-conversational-experiences-that-feel-more-natural" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a beta version of an Alexa Conversations feature</a> to Alexa Skills developers, to help them create voice apps that allow for more natural-feeling conversations where people can talk to Alexa in a &#8220;less constrained way,&#8221; using the phrases they prefer. Before this, Amazon had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/how-to-string-multiple-alexa-commands-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed a feature</a> called Follow-Up Mode, that allowed people to give their Alexa smart device multiple commands at the same time, without having to say &#8220;Alexa&#8221; each time.</p>
<p>While the new Conversation Mode technology was announced last year, Amazon tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s officially launching today and the Echo Show 10 is the first device to receive it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1461034689632686082?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a new &#8220;Rage Shake&#8221; feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in a video on Twitter and explained how it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ever use Instagram and it wasn&#8217;t working like it was supposed to? Maybe Stories didn&#8217;t load, maybe the audio wasn&#8217;t working, maybe you just couldn&#8217;t upload a photo and it was just really getting you, really just pissing you off? Now, you can literally shake the phone and a little option will come up that allows you to report a problem,&#8221; Mosseri said in the video.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. Mosseri says this will help the company prioritize bugs and learn about other things to fix in the app. For now, the feature is only available in the U.S. for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>The social media giant is also rolling out the ability to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this latest update, you can delete items from an existing carousel. It&#8217;s worth noting that you can&#8217;t add to the carousel, replace one item for another or reorder items in the carousel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2236536" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236536" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2236536" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236536" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Mosseri says this new option should have been rolled out a while ago and that it was a highly requested feature. The social media giant notes that sometimes users have made a mistake, no longer want a certain photo on their grid but still want to keep the overall carousel, or they just want to change things up with a certain post.</p>
<p>To remove an image or a video from a carousel, you have to tap on the three dots in the right-hand corner of a post and then select &#8220;edit.&#8221; Then, you can swipe to the photo or image you want to get rid of and click the &#8220;delete&#8221; icon in the top-left corner. The new feature is currently only available on iOS, with support for Android coming soon.</p>
<p>These two new launches come as Instagram has been introducing several new features over the past few weeks. Last week, it began testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">“Take a Break,”</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. The social media giant also recently rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">“Add Yours” sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before we get started, two quick notes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We’re launching Actuator as a newsletter in a few short weeks!

<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/cmus-new-robotics-institute-director-on-the-future-of-robot-research/">Carnegie Mellon announced that it had appointed Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a> the sixth director of its Robotics Institute. We’ve spoken to Johnson-Roberson a number of times in the last few years, primarily in his capacity as Refraction AI’s co-founder and CTO. When I sat down with him again last week to discuss his new role, he called me from the University of Michigan’s Ford-funded robotics wing, where he served as co-director.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a smart hire for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which is the CMU grad’s experience in both founding a startup and working as part of a corporate-university alliance. We’ve devoted a lot of words to Pittsburgh and CMU on this site over the past few years, and the consensus is that the former has been doing a better job incubating startups, but things could always improve.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2164730" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164730" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164730" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg" alt="Matthew Johnson-roberson" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>Pittsburgh is quite possibly the strongest example of how a vibrant startup scene can revitalize a region suffering from economic depression. There are, of course, broader economic issues around potentially leaving residents behind through gentrification, but on the whole, Pittsburgh has largely been regarded as a success story, bouncing back from the rust belt region’s economic devastation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly something U of M is focused on for the Ann Arbor/Detroit regions. And Ford’s model will likely prove an increasingly popular one, as corporations look to research facilities for bleeding-edge technologies, while universities look for funding beyond the traditional endowment model (something which, granted, has worked for a university named for two of America’s most powerful industrialists).</p>
<p>As Johnson-Roberson tells TechCrunch:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>So many of the technologies that were developed in the 90s and 00s are now reaching a level of maturity where they are getting rolled out in commercial products and making a big difference to the future of a lot of industries. I think it’s a natural extension of that. You begin to see relationships between universities and companies. Even if you look at Pittsburgh as a city, the transformation that it’s undergone from heavy industry focused around natural resources and steel, that transformation is only going to accelerate.</p>
<p>Part of my goal is to continue relations and build new ones. Beyond just industries, thinking about government and policy and all the other things that are now going to become more relevant for robotics — making sure we make those relationships and build on the strengths of the technical work that already goes on at the institute. That is something I’m particularly excited about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of me is hoping the robotics news slows down a bit next week, if only for my nagging FONB (fear of not blogging) while I’m out. It’s not healthy, I know. But there are worse addictions (maybe?). I get the sense things will slow down a bit for American Thanksgiving week, if only because it seems like everyone is rushing to get their news out this week. There’s a LOT to crawl through here.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a pair of acquisitions. As we noted in this column last week, iRobot has been getting aggressive about smart home. That’s largely meant things like Amazon Alexa integration up to now, but today’s news marks an interesting new angle. The Roomba maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/irobot-is-buying-air-purifier-maker-aeris/">purchased a Swiss company that makes air purifiers</a> &#8212; a move it believes can improve its footprint in users&#8217; homes.</p>
<p>CEO Colin Angle says in a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s acquisition of Aeris is an important step in iRobot’s strategy to expand our total addressable market and diversify our product portfolio in ways that will provide consumers with new ways to keep their homes cleaner and healthier. We are enthusiastic about the growth potential for Aeris’ products, especially as the pandemic has raised greater consumer awareness of the value of maintaining a cleaner, healthier home. We are also excited about the potential to leverage our Genius Home Intelligence platform and existing ecosystem of home robots to bring the iRobot experience to air purification.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/home-star-trucker/">As we noted last week</a>, most of iRobot’s biggest non-Roomba successes have come in the form of acquisitions of brands like Braava and Root. So hopefully this will open up some interesting avenues, in terms of having devices that can double as smart home beacons and improve home mapping.</p>

<p>In the agtech space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/fieldin-buys-fellow-agtech-firm-midnight-robotics/">Fieldin has acquired Midnight Robotics</a>. It’s a deal that makes a lot of sense. Fieldin makes technology that allows farms to collect data for accelerating automation, while Midnight’s tech retrofits tractors and other farming machinery with lidar-based sensors.</p>
<p>Here’s Fieldin CEO Boaz Bachar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past eight years we’ve digitized hundreds of farms and over 10,000 tractors and pieces of farming equipment — more than anyone else in the high-value crop world — and amassed a trove of invaluable data that can offer insights into best practices in farm management. By acquiring Midnight Robotics, we’re helping farmers close the loop from insight to autonomous action, so they know exactly what they need to do and execute it autonomously, all through the same platform.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/autonomous-tractor-maker-monarch-raises-61-million/">Monarch’s tractor</a>, meanwhile, is more of an all-in-one solution. The company just announced a $61 million Series B. Like Fieldin, the company cites pandemic-related job shortages as a driving force in interest around its technology.</p>

<p>From fields to the dinner table, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nommi-announces-plans-for-rollout-of-its-food-bowl-making-kitchen-robot/">Nommi just announced a distribution deal</a> with C3 (Creating Culinary Communities) that is set to bring up to 1,000 of its robotic food prep kiosks to locations across the country. The deal also brings Iron Chef’s Masaharu Morimoto’s Sa’Moto brand to the machines, which can operate 24/7, unlike even the ironest of human chefs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235415" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235415" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2235415" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zume-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235415" class="wp-caption-text">The robot is partially made of plastic, but teams up with Zume to reduce plastics. Excellent work, Judas. <strong>Photo:</strong> ABB</p></div></p>
<p>As hot as robotics are becoming in food, however, there’s probably an even brighter future in sustainable packaging &#8212; because, let’s face it, whatever direction we’re currently headed in isn’t great. In one of the wilder pivots in recent memory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/zume-kills-plastics/">Zume moved from pizza robots to bio-degradable packaging.</a> The company is, however, returning to robotics (in a sense) courtesy of a new deal with industrial giant ABB to produce its food packaging.</p>
<p>And one final Tiger Global investment before I leave you (it wouldn’t be a robotics roundup without it). The firm<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/17/2336690/0/en/SVT-Robotics-Announces-25-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-Round-Led-by-Tiger-Global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> just led a $25 million Series A</a> for SVT Robotics. The Virginia-based company is working to develop a “plug-and-play” solution for industrial robotic deployment. Here’s co-founder and CEO A.K. Schultz:</p>
<blockquote><p>The demand for industrial automation is even higher, but industry growth has been limited by capacity to execute. Integrations are typically all custom coded, meaning long development cycles. It’s expensive, and companies wait as much as a year or more for new automation to go live. Solving that problem with the SOFTBOT Platform empowers the market to grow at its full potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s it for me this week. Happy Turkey Day to those who celebrate. And don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up for Actuator here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you had &#8220;my shower head needs a small turbine, a Bluetooth connection, an app and a fine-spray mist&#8221; on your 2021 bingo card, congratulations, you win the prize. The prize is knowing that <a href="https://gethai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hai</a> exists &#8212; and this fine news story, which will tell you all about how the company raised $6 million to get all up in your biz. And we&#8217;ll probably have some good, clean fun &#8212; i.e. shower puns &#8212; thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><em>A propos</em> good measure, that, in a nutshell, is kind of the point of Hai. The founders claim that your daily de-grimification routine is one of the biggest users of water in a residential context. A lot of people care about the environment, but how do you know how much water you actually blast through on your way to a haven of godliness-adjacency? The answer is some really expensive electronics, or this (possibly equally expensive) $250 shower head. Hai is designed to be easy to install and remove using just your hands. Aimed in particular at apartment-dwellers who want &#8220;a spa-like shower experience&#8221; that they can take with them as they nomad their way from apartment to apartment, the Hai shower head is somewhat of a platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;During my 20s I moved to a new apartment every year. One of the things that I looked at every time I moved was the shower. I&#8217;m quite tall, and it was very important for me to have a shower that was tall enough &#8212; and the pressure was obviously important,&#8221; Leah Stigile, co-founder and CEO of Hai reminisced. &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom to two small children, and the time that I get in the shower every day is crucially important to my personal well-being. As I talked to other people, I realized the ritual of showering is super important to other people as well, but for a whole variety of different reasons. I was inspired to be a part of building a company that delivered an amazing experience but also helps you be mindful of the resources that you&#8217;re using.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It appears that a gaggle of investors agree with the Hai team that this is a space worth exploring in more depth. <a href="https://trousdalevc.com/">Trousdale Ventures</a> led the $6 million round, and is joined by Will Smith’s <a href="https://www.dreamers.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamers VC</a>, <a href="https://www.arodcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-Rod Corp</a>, The <a href="https://najafi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Najafi Companies</a> (owners of the Phoenix Suns and McLaren F1), Amity Supply (Jesse Derris), social media stars Josh Richards and Griffin Johnson, Noah Beck’s Animal Capital (Marshall Sandman), former board member and early investor in Peloton, Howard Draft and Local Globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invested in Hai because they have created an innovative, high-quality showerhead that meets consumer demand for sustainable home products,&#8221; said Phillip Sarofim, founder of Trousdale Ventures. &#8220;We believe that Hai delivers the best shower experience as consumers continue to shift toward personalized and environmentally conscious products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking at a $9 billion market. In my calculation when you look at the size of the space, there&#8217;s room for five or six big new entrants in this market. The interesting thing is that the $9 billion has been carved out by the same five companies for the last 75 years. What is interesting is that brand was almost irrelevant in the space,&#8221; explains Leonard Brody, co-founder of Hai. &#8220;More than <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">85% of millennials said the shower was the most important self-care ritual in their home, but the vast majority of them couldn&#8217;t tell you the brand of shower head they stood under every day. That is highly unusual in a consumer space. I bet you 60% of the same people could tell you what toilet paper brand they use.&#8221;</span></p>

Best of all: No leaks and no tools required. Photo by Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, with a huge market and no clear winner, we&#8217;ve seen a number of new companies enter the fray. It seems like the newest dribble of companies started with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nebia/nebia-shower-better-experience-70-less-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter darling Nebia pre-selling $3 million of fine-misting shower heads</a> back in 2015, before <a href="https://www.moen.com/press-room/press-releases/nebia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising investment from</a>, and later getting swallowed up by, bathroom giant Moen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the largest wastes of water in the shower is actually when you flip on the water and you wander away and are busy while you&#8217;re waiting for it to warm. The shower is running and before you know it you&#8217;ve done three loads of laundry. We&#8217;ve developed a little hydropower Bluetooth turbine and it does a couple of things. First of all, it powers the LED light on the shower that will notify you when the water is warm and ready to get in. Also, if you&#8217;ve wandered away, it&#8217;ll send you a push notification to your phone,&#8221; explains Brody. &#8220;Secondly, with a partner app that we developed, it will you can set the number of gallons of water that you want to use during your shower. The average shower is about 20 gallons of water. You can configure that, of course, but our product default is set to 20 gallons. When you hit that limit, a little light will notify you, reminding you to wrap up and hop out of the shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device tracks your water consumption over time, which takes care of one of the first challenges of awareness; namely, awareness. The company suggests that by measuring your baseline and then setting goals for yourself, you can do your bit for the environment and use a bit less water. The company also wants to use the data it gathers to make the shower experience more custom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step on the roadmap for us that&#8217;s coming in early 2022, we are taking our product and adding a layer of consumables. First up, we have what we&#8217;re calling infusions. We&#8217;ve developed a single-use no-waste pill that can be added to a capsule that fits onto the existing showerhead,&#8221; explains Stigile. &#8220;You can infuse aromatherapy or hair and skin treatments directly into the water. That really helps deliver that spa experience that we are trying to create in your home bathroom. And then the next step beyond that is filtration. With the sensors we have, we can actually be quite sophisticated about telling you what&#8217;s in your water delivering, a very personalized experience. We can even take the temperature you like to shower at into consideration and recommend the consumables that are best for your particular use case. That&#8217;s a huge opportunity there for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company only started shipping its products a few weeks ago, but so far they&#8217;re off to a <em>lather</em> good start, with promising sales through its direct channels and retail presence <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/hai-4-spray-bluetooth-enabled-handheld-showerhead/5655910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond website</a> and its New York flagship store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) has revealed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breach</a> that exposed the Social Security numbers of more than 100,000 current and former employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. pizza chain, which has more than 250 locations across 32 states, confirmed the incident in a data breach notification posted this week. The company said it learned of a “disruption” to its systems on September 15 and moved to “immediately secure” its environment. By October 4, the company said it had determined cybercriminals had infiltrated its systems and gained access to certain files, including employee names and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-security/">SSNs</a>.</p>
<p>While CPK didn&#8217;t confirm how many people are impacted by the breach, <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea812f00-c605-4b8e-a6e2-9dd53169b256.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a notification from the Maine attorney general&#8217;s office</a> reported a total of 103,767 current and former employees — including eight Maine residents — are affected. CPK employed around 14,000 people as of 2017, suggesting the bulk of those affected are former employees. (TechCrunch contacted CPK for more but did not immediately hear back.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Information security is among our highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care,” CPK added. “Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to review and reinforce the security of our computing environment. We are reviewing existing security policies and have implemented additional measures to further protect against similar incidents moving forward.”</p>
<p>However, while CPK is shoring up its security in light of the incident, it&#8217;s unclear why it took the company two months to notify state authorities of the intrusion. The company said its data breach notification “has not been delayed by law enforcement.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As machine learning becomes a more integral part of running businesses, the model-building process still requires iteration and experimentation. <a href="http://comet.ml">Comet</a> has created an entire platform to get models from idea to product, and today the company announced a $50 million Series B.</p>
<p>The investment comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/comet-announces-13m-series-a-for-ml-model-building-tool/">$13 million A round</a> in April.</p>
<p>OpenView led the round with participation from existing investors Scale Venture Partners, Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures. The company has now raised almost $70 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Gideon Mendels said that the product works on any platform from a laptop to the cloud to an on-prem cluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comet is a platform that empowers data scientists and machine learning engineers to accelerate machine learning development, and the way we do that is by managing and optimizing the entire machine learning lifecycle, so all the way from experiment tracking to model production monitoring,&#8221; Mendels told me.</p>
<p>He said that the approach has been working: The company&#8217;s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 5x this year, and Comet now counts 150 businesses using the platform, including Uber, Zappos and Etsy.</p>
<p>Mackey Craven, partner at lead investor OpenView, said that he was attracted to Comet because he sees it as a startup building a viable product for an emerging market with a big opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we see that rare combination of an exceptional founding team that can be the core of a large and enduring market opportunity that is large enough to support them and then transition in that market, either because it&#8217;s the creation of a new market or [because of] technological dislocation that allows a new entrant to create and capture the value in that market going forward, we step up and we step up big,&#8221; Craven explained.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 50 employees in nine different countries on four continents with plans to reach 100 by next year. Mendels said that diversity and inclusion are a key part of the company&#8217;s value system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just really a key part of our culture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have 35% of the team from underrepresented groups today and that continues to be a focus for future hires.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also launching a new product called Artifacts, a data versioning tool that works in the same way as a document versioning function, letting data scientists track the ways that the data has changed over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Comet Artifacts, essentially when you&#8217;re working on a machine learning pipeline, we automatically version every snapshot of the data. So every time you make a change, we make a version of it,&#8221; Mendels said, adding that this offers a number of advantages, primarily enabling data scientists to see how the data they used to train the model changes over time and compare the training model data to what&#8217;s in the model in production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle between the appetites of European Union Member States&#8217; governments to retain their citizens&#8217; data &#8212; for fuzzy, catch-all &#8220;security&#8221; purposes &#8212; and the region&#8217;s top court, the CJEU, which continues to defend fundamental rights by reiterating that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">indiscriminate mass surveillance is incompatible with general principles of EU law (such as proportionality and respect for privacy) &#8212; has led to another pointed legal critique of national law on bulk data retention.</span></p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s a German data retention law that&#8217;s earned the slap-down &#8212; via a CJEU referral which joins a couple of cases, involving ISPs SpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland, which are <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">challenging the obligation to store their customers’ telecommunications traffic data.</span></p>
<p>The court&#8217;s judgement is still pending, but an influential opinion put out today by an advisor to the CJEU takes the view that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data can only be permitted exceptionally &#8212; in relation to a threat to national security &#8212; and nor can data be retained permanently.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In a press release announcing the opinion of advocate general Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, the court writes that the AG &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">considers that the answers to all the questions referred are already in the Court’s case-law or can be inferred from them without difficulty&#8221;; going on to set out his view that the German law&#8217;s &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">general and indiscriminate storage obligation&#8221; &#8212; which covers &#8220;a very wide range of traffic and location data&#8221; &#8212; cannot be reconciled with EU law by a time limit imposed on storage as data is being sucked up in bulk, not in a targeted fashion (i.e. for a specific national security purpose). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The AG notes that indiscriminate bulk collection generates a</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;serious risk&#8221; &#8212; such as the people&#8217;s data might leak or be improperly accessed. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And reiterates that it</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> also entails a &#8220;serious interference&#8221; with citizens&#8217; fundamental rights to private and family life and the protection of personal data.</span></p>
<p>While the opinion is not legally binding, CJEU rulings tend to align with its advisors. But it will be months more before a final ruling on this particular challenge is issued.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CJEU ruled on a similar case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">over a year ago</a> &#8212; involving legal challenges brought by a couple of digital rights groups to national bulk data collection and retention regimes operating under U.K. and French law &#8212; when the court ruled that only limited data collection and temporary retention was permissible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(Although France has since been seeking to circumvent the judgement, per <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-data-retention-bypass-eu-top-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Politico</a> &#8212; which reported back in March that the government had asked its highest administrative court not to follow the ruling.)</p>
<p>In a landmark ruling back in 2014 the CJEU struck down a 2006 EU directive that had been intended to harmonize data retention rules across the bloc &#8212; finding the regime had constituted a disproportionate interference with citizens&#8217; rights. So you&#8217;d think Member States would have got the message by now.</p>
<p>However it seems unlikely this legal clash will be put to bed any time soon &#8212; not least because there are fresh moves afoot by national governments to revive a pan-EU data retention law, per a <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/07/wk07294.en211.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked discussion paper</a> that <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2021/urgently-needed-france-spain-push-for-new-eu-data-retention-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netzpolitik</a> obtained and reported on this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This summer, Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-netflix-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its own shopping <a href="https://www.netflix.shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site</a> that allowed fans to purchase apparel, accessories and other lifestyle products from their favorite shows, like &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; Now, Hulu is doing the same thing. The Disney-owned streamer announced the launch of <a href="https://shop.hulu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Hulu</a>, which will feature limited-edition collections of apparel and lifestyle products from Hulu Originals and other titles in the company&#8217;s on-demand library, as well as Hulu-branded swag. The site will also make Hulu&#8217;s annual release of its &#8220;Ugly Holiday Sweaters&#8221; available for purchase for the first time.</p>
<p>Hulu began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandTV/comments/e5loxg/hulu_is_giving_away_free_christmas_sweaters_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving away</a> its ugly sweaters to random fans as a promotional perk in 2019. The giveaway was popular enough that Hulu turned it into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIYjW_xh6xL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweepstakes</a> event last year, giving everyone a chance to win one of the sweaters, which had then <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/hulu-has-live-sports-and-ugly-holiday-sweaters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> Hulu shows like &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere,&#8221; &#8220;Shrill,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale&#8221; and others.</p>
<p>Its 2021 selection of holiday sweaters will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, November 30.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the lineup includes &#8220;Love, Victor,&#8221; &#8220;Solar Opposites,&#8221; &#8220;The Great,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid’s Tale&#8221; and &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga,&#8221; many of which had proved popular in previous years. However, unlike Netflix &#8212; which invested in its online store as a new arm of its broader retail business &#8212; Hulu&#8217;s leading product line is designed to raise funds for charity. Through December 31, 100% of the purchase price from the sale of the Ugly Holiday Sweater collection, minus taxes and shipping fees, is being donated to Feeding America, says Hulu.</p>
<p>In the fine print, the company notes it&#8217;s capping its donation at 1,000 sweaters, which is $54,950.</p>

<p>Hulu&#8217;s shop will continue to feature other products throughout the year, outside its charitable fundraising initiative for the holidays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fans of &#8220;Solar Opposites&#8221; will be able to shop apparel, glassware, stickers and more as the show&#8217;s holiday special premieres on November 22. The collection was designed in collaboration with Executive Producers Mike McMahan, Justin Roiland and Josh Bycel, the company says.</p>
<p>Also available are household items and apparel from shows like &#8220;The Orville,&#8221; &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga&#8221; (select items from the capsule collection from Mitchell &amp; Ness are available), and themed merchandise from acquired shows like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,&#8221; &#8220;American Horror Story&#8221; and &#8220;What We Do in the Shadows,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>Hulu will offer shoppers a discount for signing up for its newsletter and plans to make special offers available throughout the year, starting with Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
