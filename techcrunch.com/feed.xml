<p>Currently, the $9.99/month service is available in six countries, like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. But at its press event today, Apple announced that the service will become available in many more countries this fall, including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, France, Italy, Russia and more. Content will be subtitled in six languages.</p>

<p>Apple also announced that it will add new pilates and guided meditation content for Fitness+ subscribers starting in the fall. Every day, Fitness+ will add guided meditations that focus on gratitude, mindfulness, and calming. These experiences will be available in both video and audio form, and could pose competition to apps like Headspace and Calm.</p>
<p>Also in the fall, Fitness+ will roll out Group Workouts, powered by Share Play. This enables subscribers to exercise alongside their friends via FaceTime or a group message thread, no matter where they are in the world. Up to 32 people can exercise together at once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are founders in fundraising mode short-sighted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/is-it-so-bad-to-take-money-from-chinese-venture-funds/">when it comes to working with Chinese venture funds</a>?</p>
<p>Runa Capital&#8217;s Asia business development manager Denis Kalinin studied data from iTjuzi, a database of Chinese venture capitalists, and found:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;Chinese funds invested around $250 billion in 2020 (three times higher than the figure reported in Crunchbase). This figure puts Chinese VC investments only 30% lower than investments by U.S. funds, but three times that of U.K. funds and 12.5 times more than German funds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pandemic, geopolitical tensions and other factors led many Chinese venture funds to pare back their international investments, but that&#8217;s largely &#8220;because during COVID, China’s economy recovered much faster than other countries’,&#8221; writes Kalinin.</p>
<p>His analysis covers multiple angles: Chinese investments in Europe are catching up with those in Asia and the United States, half of China&#8217;s top cross-border investors are CVCs, and investors are particularly interested in fintech, deep tech and digital health at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese investors can bring value to foreign startups, but you need to study their expertise and how it can be useful for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toast released an early IPO price range of $30 to $33 per share on Monday, and Alex Wilhelm digs into the S-1/A filing to “better understand how to value vertical SaaS startups that are pursuing a payments-and-SaaS business approach.”</p>
<p>Is the restaurant software startup worth the $18 billion valuation it’s aiming for?</p>

<p>Every founder who launches an enterprise software startup has to figure out the &#8220;right&#8221; pricing model for their products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a consequential decision: Per-seat licenses are easy to manage, but what if customers prefer a concurrent licensing model?</p>
<p>&#8220;Early pricing discussions should center around the buyer’s perspective and the value the product creates for them,&#8221; says Ridge Ventures partner Yousuf Khan, who previously worked as a CIO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;self-evaluation is hard, especially when you’re asking someone else to pay you for something you’ve created.&#8221;</p>

<p>India&#8217;s mom-and-pop businesses are experiencing a digital transformation that&#8217;s creating new e-commerce opportunities; smartphones have replaced paper records, and a new government-backed instant payments system is disrupting how value is exchanged.</p>

<p>The multibillion-dollar exits of Japanese startup Paidy (to PayPal) and Australian buy now, pay later company Afterpay (to Square) “provided hard market proof that what BNPL startups are building has value beyond simple operating results,” Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>He breaks down the value of Afterpay, Paidy and Klarna using a simple metric: What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?</p>

<p>Video game livestreaming is booming.</p>
<p>Twitch has an average of almost 3 million concurrent viewers; by comparison, on the night of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, CNN&#8217;s livestream averaged 1.1 million.</p>
<p>The most successful streamers use their ad revenue and sponsorship money to hire video editors and social media teams to make them look good, but new automated tools are giving part-time streamers the ability to spotlight their best moments as well.</p>

<p>A data breach costs a company an average of $3.8 million, Marc Ellenbogen, Foursquare’s general counsel, notes in a guest post, adding up to a “concrete financial incentive to having The Privacy Talk.”</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>“It’s the conversation that goes beyond the written, publicly posted privacy policy and dives deep into a customer, vendor, supplier or partner’s approach to ethics,” he writes.</p>
<p>If you think the talk doesn’t apply to you, think again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rumors were right. The centerpiece of today&#8217;s big Apple event is the latest iPhone. The latest device lands less than a year after its predecessor, now that things have settled down somewhat on the supply chain side for Apple. Last year&#8217;s iPhone 12 was a massive seller, bucking the trend of stagnating smartphones sales, in part due to a bottleneck in sales from the unplanned delay, but also because it finally brought 5G connectivity to Apple&#8217;s mobile line.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202467" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-interior.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Lucky number iPhone 13 (no skipping for superstition&#8217;s sake, mind) features a familiar design. The front notch has finally been shrunken down &#8212; now 20% smaller than its predecessor, while the rear-facing camera system has also gotten a redesign. The screen is now 28% brighter Super Retina XDR display on both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini at 1200 nits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg 1680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-2021-iphone-13-angle.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The 13 sports a 6.1-inch screen, while the mini&#8217;s is 5.4 inches &#8212; same as last year. The display is protected by a ceramic shield coating, and the handset rates IP68 dust/waterproofing.</p>
<p>The phone is powered by Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip, built with a 5nm processor. The CPU is 6-core that the company is calling “the fastest CPU on any smartphone.” The new 4-core GPU, meanwhile, brings advanced graphics to the handset.</p>

<p>The rear dual-camera system features a 12MP wide angle camera that’s capable of pulling in up to 47% more light. The new Cinematic Mode, meanwhile, brings rack focus-style shooting capable of adjusting the focus on subjects, using machine learning (you can also tap to adjust manual or switch between subjects). All models in the iPhone 13 also support Night Mode shooting.</p>

<p>Following last year&#8217;s introduction of 5G, the company has added more advanced antennae. Through the combination of a larger battery and energy saving software, the company says it&#8217;s been able to eke out an additional 2.5 hours of life on the 13 and 1.5 hours on the mini.</p>
<p>iPhone 13 mini starts at $699 and, while the 13 starts at $799. It comes in b<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">lack, gold, silver and a new, lighter blue. </span>Not a massive update all told &#8212; Apple seemingly save a lot of that for the iPhone 13 Pro, which brings a 120Hz display and a number of key updates to the imaging system.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A U.S. federal judge last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">struck down</a> Apple rules restricting app developers from selling directly to customers outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-10/apple-erases-nearly-85-billion-in-value-after-app-store-ruling">fell 3%</a> on the news, which is being regarded as a win for small and midsize app developers because they’ll be able to build direct billing relationships with their customers. But Apple is just one of many Big Tech companies that dominate their sector.</p>
<p>The larger issue is how this development will impact Amazon, Facebook, Grubhub and other tech giants with online marketplaces that use draconian terms of service to keep their resellers subservient. The skirmish between Apple and small and midsize app developers is just a smaller battle in a much larger war.</p>
<p>App makers pay up to 30% on every sale they make on the Apple App Store. Resellers on Amazon pay a monthly subscription fee, a sales commission of 8% to 15%, fulfillment fees and other miscellaneous charges. Grubhub charges restaurants 15% of every order, a credit card processing fee, an order processing fee and a 10% delivery commission.</p>
<p>Like app developers, online resellers and social media influencers are all falling for the same big lie: that they can build a sustainable business with healthy margins on someone else’s platform. The reality is the App Store, online marketplaces and even social networks that dominate their sectors have the unilateral power to selectively deplatform and squeeze their users, and there’s not much to be done about it.</p>
<p>Healthy competition exists inside the App Store and among marketplace resellers and aspiring social media influencers. But no one seems to be talking about the real elephants in the room, which are the social networks and online marketplace providers themselves. In some respects, they’ve become almost like digital dictators with complete control over their territories.</p>
<p>It’s something every small and midsize business that gets excited about some new online service catering to their industry should be aware of because it directly impacts their ability to grow a stable business. The federal judge’s decision suggests the real goal in digital business is a direct billing relationship with the end user.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the internet, those who are able to lead a horse to water and make them drink — outside the walled gardens of digital marketplace operators like Uber, Airbnb and Udemy — are the true contenders. In content and e-commerce, this is what most small and midsize companies don’t realize. Your own website or <em>owned medi</em>a, at a top-level domain that you control, is the only unfettered way to sell direct to end users.</p>
<p>Mobile app makers on Apple’s App Store, resellers on Amazon and aspiring content creators on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok are all subject to the absolute control of digital titans who are free to govern by their own rules with unchecked power.</p>
<p>For access to online marketplaces and social networks, we got a raw deal. We’re basically plowing their fields like digital sharecroppers. Resellers on Amazon are forced to split their harvest with a landlord who takes a gross percentage with no caps. Amassing followers on TikTok is building an audience that’s locked inside their venue.</p>
<p>These tech giants — all former startups that built their audiences from scratch — are free to impose and selectively enforce oppressive rules. If you’re a small fry, they can prohibit you from asking for your customer’s email address and deplatform you for skimming, but look the other way when Spotify and The New York Times do the same thing. Both were already selling direct and through the App Store prior to Friday’s ruling.</p>
<p>How is that competitive? Even after the ruling, Big Tech still gets to decide who they let violate their terms of service and who they deplatform. It’s not just their audience. It’s their universe, their governance, their rules and their enforcement.</p>
<p>In the 1948 court case United States v. Paramount Pictures, the Supreme Court ruled that film studios couldn’t own their own theaters because that meant they could exclusively control what movies were screened. They stifled competition by controlling what films made it to the marquee, so SCOTUS broke them up.</p>
<p>Today, social networks control what gets seen on their platforms, and with the push of a button, they can give the hook to whoever they want, whenever they want. The big challenge that the internet poses to capitalism is that the network effect is fundamentally anti-competitive. Winner-take-all markets dominated by tech giants look more like government-controlled than free-market economies.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the web gives us access to a global marketplace of buyers and sellers. On the other, a few major providers control the services that most people use to do business, because they don’t have the knowledge or resources to stand up a competitive website. But unless you have your own domain and good search visibility, you’re always in danger of being deplatformed and losing access to your customers or audience members with no practical recourse.</p>
<p>The network effect is such that once an online marketplace becomes dominant, it neutralizes the competitive market, because everyone gravitates to the dominant service to get the best deal. There’s an inherent conflict between the goals of a winner-takes-all tech company and the goals of a free market.</p>
<p>Dominant online marketplaces are only competitive for users. Meanwhile, marketplace providers operate with impunity. If they decide they want to use half-baked AI or offshore contractors to police their terms of service and shore up false positives, there’s no practical way for users to contest. How can Facebook possibly govern nearly 3 billion users judiciously with around 60,000 employees? As we’ve seen, it can’t.</p>
<p>For app makers, online resellers and creators, the only smart option is open source on the open web. Instead of relying on someone else’s audience (or software for that matter), you own your online destination powered by software like WordPress or Discord, and you never have to worry about getting squeezed when the founders go public or their platform gets bought by profit-hungry investment bankers. Only then can you protect your profit margins. And only then are the terms of service the laws of the land.</p>
<p>Politics aside, as former President Donald Trump’s deplatforming demonstrated, if you get kicked off Facebook and Twitter, there’s really nowhere else to go. If they want you out, it’s game over. It’s no coincidence Trump lost his Facebook and Twitter accounts on the same day the Republicans lost the Senate. If the GOP takes back the Senate, watch Trump get his social media accounts back. Social networks ward off regulators by appeasing the legislative majority.</p>
<p>So don’t get too excited about the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/info">Amazon Influencer Program</a>. If you want to build a sustainable digital business, you need an owned media presence powered by software that doesn’t rake commissions, have access to your customer contact information and has an audience that can’t be commandeered with an algorithm tweak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Watch users who ride bikes will get a handful of new features designed just for them. Announced during today&#8217;s Apple iPhone press event, the company says that Apple Watch will now begin to detect when users begin a bike ride to remind you to start a workout. And similar to other workouts, Apple Watch will also automatically pause and resume as you take breaks during your ride. And, perhaps most importantly, it will gain a new fall detection feature, as well.</p>
<p>While Apple Watch can <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944">already detect a fall on Series 4  or later devices</a>, allowing users to contact emergency services if needed, Apple says that it will now add fall detection to cycling. In this case, it&#8217;s able to sense the unique motion and impact that occurs when someone falls when riding a bike &#8212; which is a different type of movement than someone who falls when standing.</p>

<p>For indoor cyclists such as Peleton enthusiasts, Apple Watch will also now better support e-bikes with an improved workout algorithm that more accurately calculates calories burned.</p>
<p>These features will join others Apple has added, like the reimagined Breathe app, new watch faces, and updates to Messages and Photos that roll out with watchOS 8. Apple additionally announced a new Watch product, as well, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-series-7-arrives-with-a-larger-more-rugged-display/">Apple Watch Series 7,</a> offering a larger Retina display, interface redesigns, new watch faces and colors, better charging, and more.</p>
<p>Related to workouts, Apple also announced an update to its subscription service, Fitness+, which will be available in 15 new countries in addition to the original six, and which is adding Pilates workouts, guided meditations, and workouts designed for skiers and snowboarders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK competition regulators are spooking tech investors in the country with an implied threat to clamp down on startup M&amp;A, according to a new survey of the industry.</p>
<p>As the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer engaged with the tech industry at a ‘Chatham House’ style event today, the Coalition for a Digital Economy (<a href="http://Coadec.com">Coadec</a>) think-tank released a survey of over 50 key investors which found startup investors are prepared to pull capital over the prospect of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority’s</a> (CMA) new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-markets-unit">Digital Markets Unit</a> (DMU) becoming a “whole-economy regulator by accident”. Investors are concerned after the CMA recommended the DMU be given &#8216;expanded powers&#8217; regarding its investigations of M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>Controversy has been stirring up around the DMU, as the prospect of it blocking tech startup acquisitions &#8211; especially by US firms, sometimes on the grounds of national security &#8211; has gradually risen.</p>
<p>In the Coadec survey, half of investors said they would significantly reduce the amount they invested in UK startups if the ability to exit was restricted, and a further 22.5% said they would stop investing in UK startups completely under a stricter regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 60% of investors surveyed said they felt UK regulators only had a “basic understanding” of the startup market, and 22.2% felt regulators didn’t understand the tech startup market at all.</p>
<p>Coadec said its conservative estimates showed that the UK Government’s DMU proposals could create a £2.2bn drop in venture capital going into the UK, potentially reducing UK economic growth by £770m.</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, Dom Hallas, Executive Director of Coadec, said: “Startups thrive in competitive markets. But nurturing an ecosystem means knowing where to intervene and when not to. The data shows that not only is there a risk that the current proposals could miss some bad behavior in some areas like B2B markets whilst creating unnecessary barriers in others like M&amp;A. Just as crucially, there’s frankly not a lot of faith in the regulators proposing them either.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The survey results emerged just as Chancellor Rishi Sunak convened the “Treasury Connect” conference in London today which brought together some of the CEOs of the UK’s biggest tech firms and VCs in a ‘listening process’ designed to reach out to the industry.</p>
<p>However, at a press conference after the event, Sunak pushed back on the survey results, citing research by Professor Jason Furman, Chair, of the Digital Competition Expert Panel, which has found that “not a single acquisition” had been blocked by the DMU, and there are “no false positives” in decision making to date. Sunak said the “system looks at this in order to get the balance right.”</p>
<p>In addition, a statement from the Treasury, out today, said more than one-fifth of people in the UK’s biggest cities are now employed in the tech sector, which also saw £11.2 billion invested last year, setting a new investment record, it claimed.</p>
<p>Sunak also said the <a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/coronavirus-business-interruption-loan-schemes/future-fund/">Future Fund</a>, which backed UK-based tech firms with convertible loans during the pandemic, handed UK taxpayers with stakes in more than 150 high-growth firms.</p>
<p>These include <a href="https://www.vaccitech.co.uk/">Vaccitech PLC</a>, which co-invented the COVID-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford and is better known as the AstraZeneca vaccine which went to 170 countries worldwide. The Future fund also invested in <a href="https://www.century.tech/">Century Tech</a>, an EdTEch startup that uses AI to personalize learning for children.</p>
<p>The UK government’s £375 million ‘<a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/ourpartners/future-fund-breakthrough/">Future Fund: Breakthrough</a>’ initiative continued from July this year, aiming at high-growth, R&amp;D-intensive companies.</p>
<p>Coadec’s survey also found 70% of investors felt UK regulators “only thought about large incumbent firms” when designing competition rules, rather than startups or future innovation.</p>
<p>However, the survey found London was still rated as highly as California as an attractive destination for startups and investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big day for hardware over at Apple HQ. In addition to all of a pair of new iPads, the company just launched the latest version of the wearable-dominated Apple Watch. As anticipated, the Apple Watch Series 7 marks one of the biggest design changes in the smartwatch&#8217;s six year history. The new Watch sports a re-engineered display that&#8217;s 20% larger than the Series 6, while &#8220;barely effecting&#8221; the watch&#8217;s size, courtesy of smaller bezels.</p>

<p>The corners are rounded and the display is significantly brighter than the last version. The new screen is able to fit 50% more text than the previous models, and the system features a new text input feature with AI predictions. The glass on the front has been fortified, and the Watch now rates IP6X.</p>

<p>Contrary to rumors, the battery hasn&#8217;t been improved this time out. It can, however, charge at around  33% faster, so you can get some quick juice in before sleep tracking.</p>

<p>Apple Watch Series 7 is arriving later this fall, starting at $399. The cases come in five different colors. The Series 3 is sticking around, priced at $279, while the SE runs $279. The new watch will ship with WatchOS 8, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-watch-will-now-detect-biking-workouts-falls-from-bike-when-riding/">which now includes bike tracking</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, we&#8217;re going to be seeing a LOT of hardware at today&#8217;s Apple event. The company has already unveiled a refresh to the iPad and here&#8217;s a new version of the Mini that looks to be the small tablet&#8217;s biggest refresh to date. The new iPad Mini sports a design overhaul that closely resembles that of the iPad Pro. That&#8217;s all built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, accomplished by significantly shrinking its bezels.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like about this refresh on top of the aforementioned aesthetic updates. It&#8217;s a long list that really rounds out the product&#8217;s functionality, including 5G, Apple Pencil support and a power button that supports TouchID for unlocking. The product is getting some nice upgrades inside, as well, with a CPU Apple says in 40% faster than its predecessor and a GPU that bumps performance up 80%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2202406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png 3754w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=2048,1145 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image-5.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The Mini sports a USB-C port and front and rear-facing 12-megapixel cameras, the former of which supports Apple&#8217;s Center Stage program. The Mini starts at $499 and goes on sale next week. Pricing, naturally, goes up when you add 5G into the mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is launching a new iPad model. This is the most affordable iPad model in the lineup, it’s cheaper than the iPad Air and iPad Pro. Today&#8217;s new iPad replaces the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/the-eighth-generation-ipad-is-a-fine-choice-for-casual-users/">existing $329 iPad</a> in the lineup.</p>
<p>It features Apple’s A13 chip. Apple originally unveiled the A13 for the iPhone 11. As a reminder, the existing iPad uses the A12 Bionic. Apple is keeping the same familiar design with a 10.2-inch display.</p>
<p>When it comes to the camera, you can expect improved auto focus and low-light performance. The front-facing is receiving a huge upgrade as it now has a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with a 122° view angle.</p>
<p>Apple is also bringing center stage to the iPad. That feature automatically detects what’s happening during a video call and crops the image to that part of the video feed in real time. It’s going to improve your family video-conferencing sessions.</p>
<p>The entry-level iPad is also getting True Tone for the first time. It’s a sort of white-balance adjustment feature for the display. Like the previous version, the new iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil with its built-in Lightning connector.</p>
<p>The new iPad will be available next week for $329 with 64GB (instead of 32GB for the previous generation). You can also get a model with cellular connectivity and schools can buy this iPad for $299. This model of iPad comes in silver and Space Gray.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Summer is winding down, the leaves are starting to change color and Apple’s getting ready to drop a brand new iPhone on the world. Today’s big event arrives less than a year after the last big iPhone event, as Apple seems to be back on schedule, after some early pandemic supply chain issues.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">a handy roundup</a> of all the things we expect to see live on video from Cupertino, based on a slew of rumors and leaks. The big news today is almost certainly the arrival of the iPhone 13. We’re also expecting the new Apple Watch Series 7 to drop, as well as some other key hardware additions, potentially including new AirPods and additional Apple Silicon Mac models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new iPhone models today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvGOlAkLSLw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">Rumor has it</a> that there will be a new generation of iPhone models. Reports suggest that the company is going to call it the iPhone 13 and that there will be four different models just like last year. Today, you can expect to learn more about the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<p>When it comes to new features, it’s safe to say that there will be big camera upgrades. This year, the company seems to be focused on video improvements in particular. The iPhone 13 should also come with a better display and a faster chip.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. Apple is likely to use this opportunity to announce a new Apple Watch model. There will be bigger design changes with the Apple Watch Series 7 with sharp edges.</p>
<p>There could be more product announcements as Apple has been working on the AirPods 3. They will replace or complement the entry-level AirPods 2 in the audio lineup. The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max will remain unchanged for now.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a small chance that we get to hear more about new Macs with custom designed Apple chips as well as new iPad models…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the &#8216;Apple Special Event&#8217; section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/livestream/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the event and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/live-from-apples-virtual-2021-iphone-event/">follow our liveblog</a> for live commentary.</p>

TikTok wants users to think about why they&#8217;re sharing their experience, if they&#8217;re ready for a wider audience to hear their story if sharing could be harmful to them, and if they&#8217;re prepared to hear others&#8217; stories in response. </span></p>
<p>The platform also added a brief, albeit generic memo about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/eating-disorders/">impact of eating disorders</a> under the &#8220;topics&#8221; section of the Safety Center, which was developed with the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631712835680000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6fZatFLr2KphvOIMd5SIVjFDvQ">National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)</a>.

<p>Already, TikTok directs users to local resources when they search for words or phrases like #suicide,* but now, the platform will also share content from creators with the intent of helping someone in need. The platform told TechCrunch that it chose this content following consultation with independent experts. Additionally, if someone enters a search phrase that might be alarming (TikTok offered &#8220;scary makeup&#8221; as an example), the content will be blurred out, asking users to opt-in to see the search results.</p>
<p>As TikTok unveils these changes, its competitor Instagram is facing scrutiny after The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">leaked documents</a> that reveal its parent company Facebook&#8217;s own research on the harm Instagram poses for teen girls. Similar to the Gen Z-dominated TikTok, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">more than 40%</a> of Instagram users are 22 or younger, and 22 million teens log into Instagram in the U.S. each day. In one anecdote, a 19-year-old interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said that after searching Instagram for workout ideas, her explore page has been flooded with photos about how to lose weight (Instagram has previously fessed up to <a href="http://bbc.com/news/technology-56750088">errors with its search function</a>, which recommended that users search topics like &#8220;fasting&#8221; and &#8220;appetite suppressants&#8221;). Angela Guarda, director for the eating-disorders program at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told The Wall Street Journal that her patients often say they learned about dangerous weight loss tactics via social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people. The research on this is mixed; it can be both,&#8221; Instagram wrote in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience/">blog post today</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As TikTok nods to with its advice on sharing mental health stories, social media can often be a positive resource, allowing people who are dealing with certain challenges to learn from others who have gone through similar experiences. So, despite these platforms&#8217; outsized influence, it&#8217;s also on real people to think twice about what they post and how it might influence others. Even when Facebook experimented with hiding the number of &#8220;likes&#8221; on Instagram, employees said that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">it didn&#8217;t improve</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> overall user well-being. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">These revelations about the negative impact of social media on mental health and body image aren&#8217;t ground-breaking, but they generate a renewed pressure for these powerful platforms to think about how to support their users (or, at the very least, add some new memos to their security center). </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[With around $3 billion invested in the first half of 2021, already around a 50% gain on 2020’s full-year figures, it’s clear Atlanta is seeing an unprecedented wave of venture investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mailchimp is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">selling itself to Intuit in a transaction valued at $12 billion</a>. The deal is a coup not only for companies that eschew venture capital backing &#8212; Mailchimp is famous for its bootstrapping history &#8212; but also for the city of its founding, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Mailchimp’s mega-exit comes in the same year that fellow Atlanta-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">Calendly raised</a> a massive $350 million round that valued the technology company north of $3 billion, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>The two companies underscore how possible it is to build large startups in markets outside of the traditional collection of cities most associated with technology entrepreneurship in the United States, like Boston, New York City and San Francisco, to name a few.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Investors are taking note. CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">data through Q2 2021</a> indicates that startups in Atlanta are on a fundraising tear, already surpassing total capital raised in 2020 in just the first half of this year. The city’s venture acceleration is similar to fundraising gains we’ve seen in markets like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>The Exchange wanted to better understand the Atlanta market, especially regarding how bullish its local inventors are that its current pace of fundraising can continue, and what sort of external interest its startups are enjoying. So, we ran questions by <a href="https://twitter.com/smccormiq">Sean McCormick</a>, the CEO of Atlanta-based <a href="https://singleops.com/">SingleOps</a>, a software startup that raised capital earlier this year; <a href="https://www.atlantaventures.com/studio">Atlanta Ventures’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atgimbel">A.T. Gimbel;</a> and <a href="https://www.blhventures.com/">BLH Venture Partners’</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishmistry/">Ashish Mistry</a>. We also heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljnoble">Paul Noble</a>, CEO of <a href="https://verusen.com">Verusen</a>, a supply chain intelligence startup that <a href="https://verusen.com/verusen-secures-8-million-series-a-to-fuel-intelligent-connected-supply-chains/">raised an $8 million Series A round</a> in January.</p>
<p>The picture that forms is one of a city enjoying a rising tide of venture activity, boosted by some local dynamics that may have helped some of its earlier-stage companies scale more cheaply than they might have in other markets. And there’s plenty of optimism to be found concerning the near future. Let’s explore.</p>
<h2>A funding boom</h2>
<p>It’s cliche at this point to note that a particular geography is experiencing record venture capital results; many cities, regions and countries are seeing startup capital inflows accelerate. But there are markets where the gains still stand out despite the generally warm climate for private capital investments into private companies.</p>
<p>Atlanta is one such market. Per CB Insights data, the U.S. city saw $2.17 billion in total investment during 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, Atlanta nearly matched its 2020 tally, with its startups collecting some $2.07 billion in total capital. Another $953 million was invested in the second quarter of the year; keep in mind that venture capital data is laggy, and thus what may appear to be a sharp decline may be ameliorated by later disclosures.</p>
<p>But with around $3 billion invested in the first half of 2021, already around a 50% gain on 2020’s full-year figures, it’s clear the city is seeing an unprecedented wave of venture investment.</p>
<p>Dollar volume is half the venture capital activity matrix, of course. The other key data line for the investment type is deal volume. There Atlanta’s activity is less superlative; Q1 2021 saw Atlanta startups attract 57 total deals, the second-best results that we have data for, narrowly losing to Q3 2017’s 59 deals.</p>
<p>But Q2 2021 saw Atlanta’s known venture deal volume fall to 42, a figure that is a slight miss from 2020’s average deal volume, measured on a quarterly basis. The same caveat regarding delayed data applies here, but perhaps not enough to completely close the gap between what we might have expected from Atlanta startups in terms of Q2 deal volume in the wake of the city’s super-active Q1.</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat slack Q2 2021 deal count in Atlanta, per current data, it’s clear that the city is enjoying record venture capital attention. What’s driving the uptick? Let’s find out.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With all the focus on whether Congress will enact a major infrastructure law to rebuild the United States’ roads, bridges, railways, etc., nobody seems to be paying attention to the elephant in the room: Even if the legislation is passed, where do we begin? You might be surprised to learn that the gig economy has an app for that.</p>
<p>We can and should hire professional consultants and other experts to review our infrastructure systems to see what needs the most immediate attention, but the sheer number of roads, bridges, dams and other critical infrastructure in the U.S. makes the job of prioritizing daunting.</p>
<p>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/National_IRC_2021-report.pdf">2021 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure</a>, there are over 4 million miles of public roads, 617,000 bridges, 91,000 dams and 140,000 rail miles in the U.S. These are massive statistics.</p>
<p>So as soon as an infrastructure bill passes, the big questions will be: Where do we begin, and how do we set priorities — expeditiously and at minimum cost, at least for the first step? The next step would be to bring in professional engineers and experts to begin the rebuilding process.</p>
<p>There are some obvious examples of infrastructure systems needing immediate, prioritized attention (see the <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/traffic/deterioration-on-houston-ship-channel-bridge-causes-lane-closures-expect-traffic-delays/285-623729390">Sidney Sherman Bridge</a> in Houston, which had to be shut down a few years ago for a corroded bridge bearing and was recently classified as “structurally deficient”).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another massive statistic out there that can help: 216 million. That is the approximate number of U.S. adults that own a smartphone. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/">Pew Research Center</a> recently found that 85% of all U.S. adults own a smartphone, which, needless to say, is the highest it’s ever been. Even enlisting just a small percentage of the 216 million smartphone users out there can help immensely with this task.</p>
<p>Federal, state and local governments can and should consider the awesome (and relatively inexpensive) power of our smartphones and the gig economy. Gig workers can be enlisted to use the smartphones that they already own to provide inspection data and photographs of the key identified roads, bridges, dams and rails in the 50 states. The data and photos they collect can then be instantly transmitted to a national database for review and evaluation by professional engineers and consultants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I know this can be done because my colleagues and I have done this before. We tap into a worldwide network of gig workers (data collectors or data contributors) operating from an open source app and with full transparency.</p>
<p>Our projects have involved contributors photographing and documenting sewer access points, bridges, water access points and other infrastructure systems. We even partnered with a major nonprofit on behalf of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to bolster its Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Program by providing rapid WASH needs assessments wherein our contributors can be mobilized on an emergency basis to provide photographs and other data on water access, sanitation and hygiene in Colombia.</p>
<p>Why can’t we do the same for bridges, roads, tunnels and other infrastructure here in the U.S.? This technology needs to be scaled, and we know it can be done.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple — and the solution is in plain sight. Our smartphones and gig workers allow us to set priorities using their photos and input from what their eyes are seeing, and then professional experts can follow up to begin implementation. There are already provisions in the Senate bill that could provide funding for this type of advanced technology research. And there is an ongoing need, even after repairs are done, to monitor the condition of our highways, bridges and tunnels.</p>
<p>Using this gig-worker-enabled smartphone technology will not only help our federal, state and local governments set priorities quickly; it will also allow thousands of everyday Americans to be part of the rebuilding process. This has the added benefit of democratizing the job of fixing our infrastructure and creating a grassroots movement of people using their own smartphones to help rebuild and repair U.S. infrastructure for the current and future generations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has again restarted its account verification process, the company said on Monday evening by way of a <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1437533358746218496">post</a> to its Twitter Verified account, where it publishes updates about the system&#8217;s status. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">launching</a> the revamped verification program this spring, Twitter had hit a few snags which have forced it to shut down verifications more than once. The most recent of these pauses was announced on August 13, when the company <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241">said</a> it need to make improvements to both the application and review process.</p>
<p>Twitter has struggled with account verifications for years. Everyone wanted the coveted blue badge that was previously doled out to public figures and other accounts of high public interest who have confirmed they are who they say they are &#8212; like a government official, journalist, celeb, brand or business, or another notable name.</p>
<p>But while the original system was meant to communicate only account authenticity, many viewed Twitter verification badgeholders as having some sort of elevated status. This issue came to a head when it was discovered in 2017 Twitter had <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verified</a> the account belonging to Jason Keller, the person who organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Shortly thereafter, Twitter officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">paused verifications</a>, but continued to quietly verify certain individuals including candidates running for public office, elected public officials, journalists, and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155028" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155028" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">rebooted</a> the system in May 2021, saying it had been rebuilt and would now have a dedicated team. It also issued new rules that more explicitly spelled out who could request verification and who could not. But demand for verification was so great that Twitter had to<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-is-pausing-public-verification-process-blue-check-2021-5"> temporarily pause verification</a> only 8 days after it launched so the team could catch up with the number of requests.</p>
<p>After it restarted, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241">again put the system on pause</a> in August, explaining it needed more time to get things right. It&#8217;s not clear how well verifications were going at this point, as social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1436077615333453825">Matt Navarra pointed out that</a> Twitter had accidentally verified a fake account for Rockstar Games. And earlier this summer, Twitter had<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-suspends-some-fake-accounts-it-verified-by-mistake-2021-07-13/"> admitted</a> that it had permanently suspended <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1414475519609999366">some fake accounts</a> that it had mistakenly verified, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter says users who are looking to be verified should keep checking their account settings screen for access to the in-app application. It didn&#8217;t detail what, specifically had changed &#8212; but hopefully the system will now remain open for good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptdeskpost">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> (happening just next week), there is more to explore than ever before. From the scores of Startup Alley companies to the Startup Battlefield presentations to the Disrupt Stage, Extra Crunch Stage and beyond.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from big name VCs like Chamath Palihapatiya, a16z&#8217;s Katie Haun, GC&#8217;s Niko Bonatsos, Forerunner&#8217;s Kirsten Green and more. Founders, such as Stewart Butterfield (Slack), Tope Awotona (Calendly), Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) and Melanie Perkins (Canva), will share how they&#8217;ve grown an idea into a unicorn. We&#8217;ll even have policy folks like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the SEC&#8217;s Erin Schneider at the show, with celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Seth Rogen to boot.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Extra Crunch stage</a>, panels on how to raise your first dollars, how to craft your pitch deck, how to land your first B2B customers and how to find product market fit will include audience Q&amp;A, to make sure you leave with everything you need to know to be successful.</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be impossible to catch it all in real time. But the Disrupt Desk is making its grand return after debuting in 2020.</p>
<p>The Disrupt Desk will hit you with all the biggest highlights from the show, complete with analysis of breaking news and meaningful insights from our speakers. Plus, the Disrupt Desk will have a few never-before-seen demos and breaking news announcements.</p>
<p>Of course, alongside catching up with the Disrupt Desk, Disrupt attendees can catch everything from the show on-demand with their complementary 3-month Extra Crunch membership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LinkedIn first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Stories format, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-video-profiles-and-in-partnership-with-microsoft-new-career-training-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded its tools for creators</a> earlier this year, one noticeable detail was that the Microsoft-owned network for professionals hadn&#8217;t built any kind of obvious monetization into the program &#8212; noticeable, given that creators earn a living on other platforms like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, and those apps had lured creators, their content, and their audiences in part by paying out.</p>
<p>“As we continue to listen to feedback from our members as we consider future opportunities, we’ll also continue to evolve how we create more value for our creators,” is how LinkedIn explained its holding pattern on payouts to me at the time. But that strategy may have backfired for the company &#8212; or at least may have played a role in what came next: last month, LinkedIn announced it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrapping its Stories format</a> and going back to the proverbial drawing board to work on other short-form video content for the platform.</p>
<p>Now comes the latest iteration in that effort. To bring more creators to the platform, the company today <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-latest-investment-creators-andrei-santalo/?trackingId=5vS3zafEQ867lzaeBiF2vw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would be launching a new $25 million creator fund, which initially will be focused around a new Creator Accelerator Program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming on the heels of LinkedIn also continuing to work on one of its other new-content experiments: a Clubhouse-style live conversation platform. As we previously reported, LinkedIn began working on this back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March of this year</a>. Now, we are hearing that the feature will make an appearance as part of a broader events strategy for the company very soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be starting to test audio with a small pilot group in the coming weeks,&#8221; Chris Szeto, senior director of product at LinkedIn, who heads up its audio efforts. &#8220;Given the trends in virtual, hybrid events we are also working on making audio part of our overall event strategy rather than a standalone offering, so that we can give people more choice about how they want to run and engage with their audiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-latest-investment-creators-andrei-santalo/?trackingId=5vS3zafEQ867lzaeBiF2vw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> announcing the creator fund, LinkedIn also listed a number of creator events coming up. Will the Clubhouse-style feature pop up there? Watch this space. Or maybe&#8230; listen up.</p>
<p>In any case, the creator accelerator that LinkedIn is announcing today could help feed into that wider pool of people that LinkedIn is hoping to cultivate on its platform as a more dynamic and lively set of voices to get more people talking and spending time on LinkedIn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Andrei Santalo, global head of community at LinkedIn, noted in the blog post that the accelerator/incubator will be focused on the whole creator and the many ways that one can engage on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating content on LinkedIn is about creating opportunity, for yourselves and others,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;How can your words, videos and conversations make 774+ million professionals better at what they do or help them see the world in new ways?&#8221;</p>
<p>The incubator will last for 10 weeks and will take on 100 creators in the U.S. to coach them on building content for LinkedIn. It will also give them chances to network with like-minded individuals (naturally&#8230; it is LinkedIn), as well as a $15,000 grant to do their work. The deadline for applying (which you do <a href="http://linkedin.com/creators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is October 12.</p>
<p>The idea of starting a fund to incentivize creators to build video for a particular platform is definitely not new &#8212; and that is one reason why it was overdue for LinkedIn to think about its own approach.</p>
<p>Leading social media platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram and Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/youtubes-100-million-shorts-fund-to-challenge-tiktok-goes-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> all have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts in the form of creator funds to bring more original content to their platforms.</p>
<p>You could argue that for mass-market social media sites, it&#8217;s important to pay creators because competition is so fierce among them for consumer attention.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, those platforms have appeal for creators because of the potential audience size. At 774 million users, LinkedIn isn&#8217;t exactly small, but the kind of content that tends to live on there is so different, and maybe drier &#8212; it&#8217;s focused on professional development, work, and &#8220;serious&#8221; topics &#8212; that perhaps it might need the most financial incentive of all to get creators to bite.</p>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s bread and butter up to now has been around professional development: people use it to look for work, to get better jobs, to hire people, and to connect with people who might help them get ahead in their professional lives.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s done so in a very prescribed set of formats that do not leave much room for exploring &#8220;authenticity&#8221; &#8212; not in the modern sense of &#8220;authentic self&#8221;, and not in the more old-school sense of just letting down your guard and being yourself. (Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively newer initiatives like its education focus</a> directly play into this bigger framework.)</p>
<p>With authenticity becoming an increasing priority for people &#8212; and maybe more so as we have started to blur the lines between work and home because of Covid-19 and the changes that it has forced on us &#8212; I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether LinkedIn will use this opportunity to rethink, or at least expand the concept of, what it means to spend time on its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wall-mounted fitness startup Tonal this morning announced that it’s bringing live courses to it portfolio of strength training workouts. The company did a soft launch of the live offering back in December of last year, though at the time, it wasn’t live, so much as prerecorded &#8212; “live, on tape,” to steal a line from The Larry Sanders Show.</p>
<p>“[Y]our coach works out with you — just like in a live class,” the company wrote. Our Live (Beta) workouts combine the energizing feeling of working out alongside a coach with Tonal’s ability to count your reps and wait for you to complete each set […] It’s all on-demand, so you can work out whenever it fits into your schedule.”</p>
<p>The new offering brings the company’s content selection more in-line with leaders in the home fitness space like Peloton. Certainly live isn’t for everyone, but many users do appreciate the motivation that comes with a fixed schedule, as well as the sense of community one derives from working out with others.</p>
<p>The new offering provides real-time feedback from coaches, coupled with a “social zone” for interacting with fellow Tonal users. The portfolio is also getting four new coaches for live workouts. After a day, live workouts will be archived in Tonal’s on-demand offerings.</p>
<p>“As our community has grown over the past few years, we’ve been encouraged by the organic social engagement, the craving for more interaction with our coaches, and the excitement that comes from reaching new milestones,” founder and CEO Aly Orady said in a release. “Tonal Live will allow us to connect these elements through a studio experience while retaining the foundation of what differentiates our workouts: personalization, guidance, and feedback.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, the San Francisco-based company is among those connected fitness brands that saw a major boost as the pandemic forced many to rethink their workout routines. Tonal has raised $450 million to date, including a $250 million Series E that raised its valuation to $1.6 billion, back in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Redwood Materials, the company started by former Tesla co-founder JB Straubel that aims to create a circular supply chain for batteries, is expanding its business. While it has been known primarily as a recycling firm, Redwood plans to simplify the supply chain by producing critical battery materials right here in the U.S.</p>
<p>To get there, the company is currently scouting a location for a new million-square-foot factory, at a cost of over $1 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/a-tesla-co-founder-aims-to-build-an-entire-u-s-battery-industry">Bloomberg reported</a>. That factory would be dedicated to the production of cathodes and anode foils, the two essential building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure &#8212; up to a projected volume of 100 gigawatt-hour per year&#8217;s worth of materials, enough for one million electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IN9RXK2ph0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=IN9RXK2ph0" data-secret="IN9RXK2ph0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But that’s not all. By 2030, the company expects to increase its annual battery materials production to 500 GWh, enough to power five million electric vehicles.</p>
<p>These numbers are incredibly ambitious. If Redwood can pull it off, it would be putting itself squarely among the ranks of the largest materials giants in the world, many of which are located in Asia. BloombergNEF estimated that consolidating the cathode supply chain to the United States, and using a certain percentage of recycled materials, could cut emissions from battery-pack production by 41%.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202141" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202141" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2202141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png 1764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=1536,751 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-1.45.21-PM.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redwood Materials <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Recycling alone won’t take the company to these kinds of production numbers, though Redwood is also planning to expand its recycling operations. Instead, the company said in a statement that it would produce the anodes and cathodes from both recycled batteries and “sustainably mined material.” For now, the company is staying mum on its partners for this new endeavor, but it will likely mean more announcements of partnerships and expansions in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is just the latest bold move from the company, which has been making moves to aggressively expand its footprint for months. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/redwood-materials-is-setting-up-shop-near-the-tesla-gigafactory-as-part-of-broader-expansion/">Earlier this summer</a>, Redwood said it would triple the size of its 150,000-square-foot recycling facility in Carson City, Nevada, and it also purchased 100 acres of land near Tesla and Panasonic’s Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada. The news also comes fresh off the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">$700 million</a> Series C funding round from major investors, including Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Baillie Gifford and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The capital launched Redwood’s valuation to $3.7 billion.</p>

<p>The company has recycling deals with Tesla, Amazon, electric bus maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-partnering-with-proterra-to-supply-ev-battery-materials-sustainably/">Proterra</a>, and electric bike maker Specialized Bicycle Components. Redwood says it can recover between 95-98% of critical materials from recycled batteries, such as lithium, copper, nickel and cobalt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s biometric scanner for retail, the Amazon One palm reader, is expanding beyond the e-commerce giant&#8217;s own stores. The company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-expands-beyond-retail-with-first-third-party-customer-ticketing-company-axs">announced</a> today it has acquired its initial third-party customer with ticketing company AXS, which will implement the Amazon One system at Denver, Colorado&#8217;s Red Rocks Amphitheatre as an option for contactless entry for event-goers.</p>
<p>This is the first time the Amazon One system will be used outside an Amazon-owned retail store, and the first time it&#8217;s used for entry into an entertainment venue. Amazon says it expects AXS to roll out the system to more venues in the future, but didn&#8217;t offer any specifics as to which ones or when.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Online retailers: Stop trying to beat Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/online-retailers-stop-trying-to-beat-amazon/embed/#?secret=EHevEgqNoJ" data-secret="EHevEgqNoJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At Red Rocks, guests will be able to associate their AXS Mobile ID with Amazon One at dedicated stations before they enter the amphitheatre, or they can enroll at a second station once inside in order to use the reader at future AXS events. The enrollment process takes about a minute and customers can choose to enroll either one or both palms. Once set up, ticketholders can use a dedicated entry line for Amazon One users.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to work with Amazon to continue shaping the future of ticketing through cutting-edge innovation,&#8221; said Bryan Perez, CEO of AXS, in a statement. &#8220;We are also excited to bring Amazon One to our clients and the industry at a time when there is a need for fast, convenient, and contactless ticketing solutions. At AXS, we are continually deploying new technologies to develop secure and smarter ticketing offerings that improve the fan experience before, during, and after events,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2202152" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2202152" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2202152" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-one-reader.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2202152" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s palm reader was <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/introducing-amazon-one-a-new-innovation-to-make-everyday-activities-effortless">first introduced amid the pandemic</a> in September 2020, as a way for shoppers to pay at Amazon Go convenience stores using their palm. To use the system, customers would first insert their credit card then hover their palm over the device to associate their unique palm print with their payment mechanism. After setup, customers could enter the store just by holding their palm above the biometric scanner for a second or so. Amazon touted the system as a safer, &#8220;contactless&#8221; means of payment, as customers aren&#8217;t supposed to actually touch the reader. (Hopefully, that&#8217;s the case, considering the pandemic rages on.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the tech side, Amazon One uses computer vision technology to create the palm signatures, it said.</p>
<p>In the months that followed,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/amazon-expands-its-biometric-based-amazon-one-palm-reader-system-to-more-retail-stores/"> Amazon expanded the biometric system</a> to several more stores, including other Amazon Go convenience stores, Amazon Go Grocery stores and its Amazon Books and Amazon 4-star stores. This April, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/amazon-is-bringing-its-amazon-one-palm-scanner-to-select-whole-foods-as-a-payment-option/">brought the system</a> to select Whole Foods locations. To encourage more sign-ups, Amazon even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">introduced</a> a $10 promotional credit to enroll your palm prints at its supported stores.</p>
<p>When palm prints are linked to Amazon accounts, the company is able to collect data from customers&#8217; offline activity to target ads, offers and recommendations over time. And the data remains with Amazon until a customer explicitly deletes it, or if the customer doesn&#8217;t use the feature for at least two years.</p>
<p>While the system offers an interesting take on contactless payments, Amazon&#8217;s track record in this area has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">raised</a> privacy concerns. The company had in the past sold <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S. Its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. And it was found to be still storing Alexa voice data <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681423/amazon-alexa-echo-chris-coons-data-transcripts-recording-privacy">even after users deleted</a> their audio files.</p>
<p>Amazon has responded by noting its palm print images are encrypted and sent to a secure area built for Amazon One in the cloud where Amazon creates the customers’ palm signatures. It also has noted it allows customers to unenroll from either a device or from its website, one.amazon.com once all transactions have been processed.</p>
