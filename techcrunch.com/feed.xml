</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is working on a new high-end VR headset codenamed Project Cambria. The company teased the device during its recent Connect conference on Thursday. It plans to release the headset sometime next year. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it will be a separate &#8220;high-end&#8221; product from the company&#8217;s $299 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Quest 2 headset</a>. It will also cost more than that device.</p>
<p>Cambria will include capabilities that currently aren&#8217;t possible on other VR headsets. New sensors in the device will allow your virtual avatar to maintain eye contact and reflect your facial expressions. The company says that&#8217;s something that will allow people you&#8217;re interacting with virtually to get a better sense of how you&#8217;re feeling. Another focus of the headset will be mixed-reality experiences. With the help of new sensors and reconstruction algorithms, Facebook claims Cambria will have the capability to represent objects in the physical world with a sense of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Cambria will also feature new optics that the company said will increase visual fidelity. Facebook promised to share more details about the headset next year. In the meantime, it mentioned that third-party developers are already working on experiences for the device.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[You won't have to buy a Lucid Air if you want a car with more immersive Dolby Atmos. Mercedes will equip its cars with Atmos audio on all models that use both its latest MBUX interface (introduced with the latest S-Class) and an optional Burmester 3D or 4D sound system. Whether or not you'll driving, you'll hear compatible music in a vertically enhanced sound field — it might not sound like a "live concert" as Mercedes claims, but it should be a step up from the usual stereo playback.]]></description>

<p>The 4D system includes 31 speakers, six of which create the 3D effect from above. Another four &#8220;near-ear&#8221; speakers sit in the front seats, and all four seats have two sound transducers (aka exciters) each. Throw in 1750W of total power (including an 18.5-liter subwoofer) and you&#8217;ll likely be happy regardless of the audio processing.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t plan on buying an Atmos-equipped car right away. The format will first be available in the Mercedes-Maybach in summer 2022, and the S-Class soon after.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 28, 2021. With our SaaS event now behind us — a big thanks to the TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/about-techcrunch/">events and sales teams</a> who keep crushing it for the publication — we can pivot our focus back to, well, the metaverse? — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"><strong>Facebook goes Meta</strong></a><strong>: </strong>By creating a brand above its preceding corporate domicile, Facebook has created a meta-entity to include its various projects. And one of those is the metaverse. Thus, the new name for the company — Meta — makes pretty good sense. Most folks don’t seem to like it much, but it’s hard to weed the General Facebook Snark from the Actually About The Name Snark, if that makes sense. More in our Big Tech section down below.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/nerdwallets-ipo-proves-you-can-write-your-way-to-a-unicorn-valuation/"><strong>NerdWallet writes its way to unicorn valuation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As online finance content empire NerdWallet approaches the public markets, the writing-centric company will garner a valuation north of $1 billion, per its latest IPO filings. TechCrunch, a words-first publication, had thoughts on the matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/mark-zuckerberg-takes-thinly-veiled-shots-at-apple-for-stifling-innovation-via-its-platform-policies/"><strong>Facebook is cross with Apple:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Facebook — Meta, I suppose — took a few potshots at Apple during its big event today. They are worth considering apart from the larger branding and VR efforts that the company announced. Apple’s changing privacy rules have taken a toll on Facebook, and the social giant is not pleased about it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into the startup news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">former startup Allbirds is going public, and TechCrunch has the details on just what it is worth</a>. And, in the wake of Rent the Runway, we are starting to see a valuation band created for tech-enabled IPOs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226002" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/atlys-raises-4-25m-to-make-visa-applications-faster-and-easier/"><strong>Atlys wants to make visa applications quicker:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And it just raised $4.25 million for its work. Sure, fewer of us than normal are flying overseas, but eventually we’ll get back on planes and go places. And when we do, well, the paperwork will beckon. Perhaps Atlys can take some of the sting out of stapling photos of yourself to a packet that you then mail to the black hole of an embassy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/cover-a-modular-home-builder-thats-modeled-in-ways-after-tesla-has-raised-a-60-million-series-b/"><strong>Soon we shall all live in pods:</strong></a> Prefab pods, if Cover gets its way. The startup creates walls and other similar home components in its factory. Those bits are then shipped to building sites and set up sans a crane. Frankly, let’s hope this works? We have a housing crisis in the United States, and any movement toward alleviating it is welcome. The company also just raised $60 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tim-berners-lee-startup-inrupt-funding/"><strong>Inrupt’s plans to reclaim internet privacy raising capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The deal isn’t done yet, but TechCrunch broke news today that Tim Berners-Lee’s Inrupt startup, a company that wants to build “a platform that gives users control of their data” online, is looking to raise between $30 million and $40 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/oneroof-raises-1-25m-to-build-a-hyper-localized-nextdoor/"><strong>What if Nextdoor was even more insular?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Well, that’s what OneRoof is building, an even more hyperlocal Nextdoor, the social network known to bring neighbors together so that they can argue and throw racist invective at one another. Now you will be able to do so in even tighter-knit circles. The company just raised $1.25 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiger-coatue-double-down-on-hinge-health-with-new-400m-infusion/"><strong>Healthcare remains a lucrative market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from Hinge Health raising $400 million in a new round. The company is focused on chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, which encompass things like aching backs and knees. Given how large the American healthcare market is, the company’s $6.2 billion valuation may make a mote more sense than you are mentally giving it credit for.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/"><strong>Alchemy raises $250M in competitive round:</strong></a> Every venture investor is in awe of Amazon’s AWS group, because it eats growth and shits operating profit. It’s worth a zillion dollars. So it’s perhaps not surprising that the competition to put capital into Alchemy was more than hot. The firm provides basic infra to other crypto companies, and a grip of crypto companies that you know of are already Alchemy customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/yugabyte-stores-up-188m-more-for-its-open-source-distributed-sql-database-model-now-valued-at-1-3b/"><strong>Yugabyte raises yuge venture round at yuger valuation:</strong></a> Yugabyte is now a unicorn, which feels like a very 2021 sentence. The database company just added $188 million to its own financial database at a valuation of $1.3 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/dragos-series-d-unicorn/"><strong>Dragos raises $200M, soars to $1.7B valuation, sadly isn’t about dragons:</strong></a> Dragos works in industrial cybersecurity, which matters. Keeping IRL infra safe is a pretty big deal. But when I read the company&#8217;s name I was frankly hoping for mythical beasts. Alas.</li>
<li>And to close out our startup notes, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">TechCrunch’s Neesha Tambe</a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/sequoia-provides-founders-with-key-insights-on-launching-building-and-fundraising/">notes from a chat with Sequoia</a> concerning fundraising tips for today’s startups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market</h2>
<p>Giving consumers the convenience of deferring payment for a product is not a new idea, but now that upstarts like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have taken the concept to the next level, legacy credit card companies and payment firms are taking notice.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Azevedo and Ryan Lawler have identified a &#8220;slow emergence&#8221; in the BNPL space &#8220;of a symbiotic relationship between traditional financial institutions, payments upstarts and leading companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visa announced yesterday that many companies are using its technology to power point-of-sale BNPL solutions; last month, its rival rolled out Mastercard Installments, its bespoke offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not really a surprise that these credit card companies are stepping it up when it comes to BNPL,&#8221; reported Ryan and Mary Ann. &#8220;If anything, it’s a wonder that it took them this long.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Before we get to our Facebook News Roundup, Twitter also made a bit of noise today. Users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-launches-spaces-recording-feature-to-testers-on-ios-global-launch-to-follow/">will now be able to record Spaces</a>, its audio chat rooms. And its subscription “Blue” service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-blue-introduces-labs-to-give-users-early-access-to-new-features/">will include early feature access</a>.</p>
<h3>The rest of what Facebook announced:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-teases-polar-a-mobile-app-for-creating-ar-filters/">Facebook teases Polar, a mobile app for creating AR filters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-messenger-audio-calls-are-coming-to-oculus-quest/">Facebook Messenger audio calls are coming to Oculus Quest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-opens-oculus-store-to-2d-progressive-web-apps/">Facebook opens Oculus Store to 2D progressive web apps</a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off ‘Oculus’ brand</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>And from the rest of Big Tech:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/"><strong>Digging into majors attacking the BNPL market:</strong></a> While Affirm is best known as an early BNPL startup that made it to the public markets, Big Finance is not going to let tech have all the fun. Mary Ann and Ryan investigate.</li>
<li>And in news that is sure to make other companies as happy as the privacy changes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/apples-app-privacy-report-launches-into-beta-to-show-you-what-your-apps-are-up-to/">Apple’s “App Privacy Report” is now in beta</a>. Do note, please, that the more Apple pisses off other companies regarding data privacy, the better off consumers may be — but also that Apple is only doing this for its own results, not because it likes us.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Terran Orbital, a leading manufacturer of small satellites, is going public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp. The deal has a post-transaction enterprise value of $1.58 billion and will furnish the company with around $470 million.</p>
<p>Of those funds, $345 million will come from Tailwind Two’s contribution, plus $50 million PIPE provided by AE Industrial Partners, Beach Point Capital, Daniel Staton, Lockheed Martin and Fuel Venture Capital. An additional $75 million has been committed by Francisco Partners and Beach Point Capital, and the company may have access to up to $125 million in debt commitments from Francisco Partners and Lockheed Martin at the close of the transaction.</p>
<p>Terran’s announcement is a reflection that space startups are still looking to SPAC mergers as a way to raise cash and go public. Deals with blank-check firms have become a popular route to the public markets in the space industry; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Virgin Orbit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">Planet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">Redwire</a>, BlackSky, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/satellite-constellation-operator-spire-global-to-go-public-via-1-6-billion-spac/">Spire Global</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">Rocket Lab</a>, Momentus and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a> are among the space companies that have raised billions through this financial vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Terran Orbital is a contract manufacturer, designing, building and engineering satellites primarily for the U.S. government. Around 95% of Terran’s work is related to NASA and the Department of Defense, CEO Marc Bell told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company will be opening <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/terran-orbital-to-open-a-300m-satellite-manufacturing-and-component-facility-on-floridas-space-coast/">the world’s largest space vehicle manufacturing facility</a> on Florida’s Space Coast at an investment of $300 million, it announced in September. The 660,000-square-foot facility will have the capacity to manufacture 1,000 complete satellites and over 1 million satellite components per year — a volume unheard of in the space industry.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing satellites, Terran Orbital also aims to operate its own earth observation constellation and deliver satellite imagery as a service. In a statement, Bell called it the new SaaS: “satellites as a service.”</p>
<p>The transaction, which has already received unanimous approval by both Terran Orbital and and Tailwind Two’s boards of directors, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s very hard to feel poorly for a company worth around $1.75 trillion, so we won&#8217;t. But shareholders of Amazon stock are taking on a bit of water in after-hours trading this afternoon. Amazon reported its <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q3 2021 results</a> today after the bell, detailing its recent performance that included a top-and-bottom miss on revenues and profits.</p>
<p>In the three months concluding September 30, 2021, the e-commerce and cloud computing giant reported $110.8 billion in revenues, up 15% compared to the year-ago period. Amazon also reported net income of $3.2 billion in the period, or $6.12 per share.</p>
<p>Analysts <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/analysis?p=AMZN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had expected</a> the company to post revenues of $111.6 billion, and per-share earnings of $8.92. The company&#8217;s net income dipped by some 49% on a year-over-year basis.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226030" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shares of Amazon are off just over 5% as we write to you this afternoon.</p>
<p>But while Amazon&#8217;s Q3 performance missed the mark &#8212; the company&#8217;s AWS unit did report accelerating revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, providing something for the company&#8217;s fans to crow about &#8212; its Q4 notes may overshadow its trailing results. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/3-analysts-weigh-in-what-are-andy-jassys-top-priorities-as-amazons-new-ceo/">new CEO, Andrew Jassy</a>, said the following in the company&#8217;s earnings digest:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>The executive framed the impending costs as customer-forward, arguing that taking near-term hits for longer-term results is reasonable. Investors were not sufficiently content with the promise of future cash flows to avoid reducing the company&#8217;s market cap by a few dozen billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But, as we noted, it&#8217;s hard to feel that bad for the firm given that Amazon reported net income north of $1 billion per month in Q3.</p>

<p>Cloud revenues are the element of Amazon earnings that we at TechCrunch pay the most attention to, so let&#8217;s peek at the data. First, here&#8217;s how the company&#8217;s AWS division performed in revenue and operating income terms:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2226046 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png" alt="" width="559" height="69" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=300,37 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226045" style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226045" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226045 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png" alt="" width="556" height="72" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png 556w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=300,39 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>So about $4.5 billion in new year-over-year revenues, and around $1.5 billion in new operating income. For those of you curious, both AWS and revenue and operating expenses grew by around 39% in the year-over-year window. Now let&#8217;s take a closer peek at pure growth metrics:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2226046 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png" alt="" width="559" height="69" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=300,37 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226044" style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226044" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226044 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png" alt="" width="557" height="201" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png 557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=300,108 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226044" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>This set of data is notable because AWS is the fastest growing segment at Amazon. While the company is mostly in the headlines thanks to its e-commerce operations it is now being growth-led by its quieter cloud group. How long until investors demand that the company be split in two to unlock value?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi has rolled out a new software update to its 2019 model year e-tron electric SUV that will add up to 12 miles of range to the battery.</p>
<p>While the improvement might not seem significant — it is, after all, only 12 miles — it does show how automakers are using software to improve older electric vehicles. In this case, Audi used software to unlock more capacity in the existing battery, essentially improving its efficiency. The automaker also said the software updates have improved the efficiency of the front electric motor and the battery&#8217;s thermal management system.</p>
<p>The 2019 Audi e-tron 55 quattro is equipped with a 95 kilowatt-hour battery and will now use 86 kWh of capacity. That will push its range from the original 411 kilometers to about 441 km (274 miles) under the WLTP standard. (EPA standard is considered more conservative; the original EPA estimates for the 2019 was 204 miles.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The software update is available to all Audi e-tron 55 quattro production vehicles built between mid-September 2018 (model year 2019) and the end of November 2019 (model year 2020). Unlike Tesla, which lets owners launch software updates over-the-air, meaning anywhere they can access Wi-Fi, Audi requires a visit to one of its service centers.</p>
<p>This will help the older model keep apace of the newer 2020 and 2021 Sportback and e-tron SUV, which have improved software and hardware.</p>
<p>One might wonder why Audi didn&#8217;t just use that capacity to begin with. Audi and other automakers entering into the EV game initially limited the usable capacity of its battery out of an abundance of caution to avoid any degradation.</p>
<p>Other automakers are beginning to use over-the-air software updates, following Tesla&#8217;s lead, to improve or add features. In February, Volvo launched its first OTA software update on its all-electric XC40 Recharge in Europe. Volvo released an OTA this month that increased driving range through improvements to the battery management system and pre-conditioning timer. The company also launched a <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/289321/optimise-the-range-of-your-fully-electric-volvo-with-new-range-assistant-app-in-latest-over-the-air" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Range Assistant app</a> to help drivers get the most range out of their batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Grab’s announcement of its imminent <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Grab-says-on-track-to-close-SPAC-deal-by-end-of-2021">Nasdaq listing</a> and GoJek merging with Tokopedia to form tech giant <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesias-goto-set-wrap-up-2-bln-funding-round-eyes-ipo-2022-sources-2021-08-19/">GoTo</a>, casual international observers could be forgiven for believing that Southeast Asia’s tech universe only comprises similar companies. However, these companies only represent the highlights of what is a blossoming startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is hitting a sweet spot. It remains at a relatively nascent phase expansion in the technology industry but is at the same time developed enough to have a 400-million-strong internet user base. By late 2021, approximately 80% of the Southeast Asian population (aged 15 and above) will be digital consumers, according to a report by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/southeast-asia-the-home-for-digital-transformation">Facebook and Bain &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, tech startup growth is booming as well. More than 35 tech startups across e-commerce, fintech and SaaS have achieved unicorn status in Southeast Asia, which has over 200 significant startups. As per Jungle Ventures’ calculations, the total value of the region’s digital companies is around $340 billion today and is estimated to grow to $1 trillion by 2025.</p>
<p>Further, Southeast Asian companies are breaking IPO records. Both Grab and GoTo’s valuations hover around the $35 billion to $40 billion mark. Sea is the 65<sup>th</sup> most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $187 billion, while Bukalapak was Indonesia’s largest-ever IPO at $1.5 billion at a market cap of $8 billion. There are many more waiting in the pipeline hoping to join this illustrious club of Southeast Asian tech decacorns.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite strong e-wallet adoption, over 70% of adults in Southeast Asia remain either underbanked or unbanked due to various cost and geographical limitations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Vertical e-commerce is climbing the vine</h2>
<p>E-commerce will continue to accelerate in Southeast Asia — the sector is projected to grow 80% year on year and double in five years to $254 billion from $132 billion in 2021, according to the Facebook and Bain report. Shopee, Lazada, GoTo and Bukalapak are testament to the phenomenal growth opportunities available, and they are still growing.</p>
<p>While initial e-commerce success came from retail-focused companies such as Shopee and Lazada, the next value creation wave is emerging through vertical e-commerce.</p>
<p>Carro, which achieved unicorn status this year, offers an automotive marketplace in addition to supplementary products such as financing and insurance. Others like Livspace, Pomelo, Zalora and Sociolla are serving the home goods, fashion and personal care industries, respectively, and raising millions of dollars in funding. Their success is underpinned by the fact that at a product category level, Southeast Asia is still in the early stages of online retail penetration.</p>
<p>Based on the chart below, just &#8220;catching up&#8221; to the same level of penetration as China in verticalized segments increases the e-commerce opportunity by four to five times across the region.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing a new in-app tipping feature on its platform that would allow creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. The company confirmed the feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not yet broadly available.</p>
<p>TikTok creator <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean/video/7023876662139866415?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lang=en">Jera Bean</a> first spotted the feature and posted a video showcasing the new option, which was then highlighted by social media consultant<a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1453506329872670722"> Matt Navarra</a> on Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TikTok is rolling out a Tips feature to some creators </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>h/t jera.bean <a href="https://t.co/fmrfuxdkrG">https://t.co/fmrfuxdkrG</a> <a href="https://t.co/hufl2qopk2">pic.twitter.com/hufl2qopk2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1453506329872670722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Her video shows the new feature in her TikTok account&#8217;s settings and the screen where TikTok details the requirements.</p>
<p>Creators who are part of the limited test can apply for the feature if they have at least 100,000 followers and are in good standing, the screen explains. Once creators submit an application to activate the feature, they’ll be notified when their account is approved. Creators that have been approved will be given a Tips button on their profiles, which their followers will be able to use to send them direct payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tips page also notes that the money received by creators will go directly to them and that TikTok will not be taking a cut. It’s unknown if TikTok plans to take a cut from creator Tips in the future if the feature progresses past the testing stage, but that seems likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch, when reached for comment.</p>
<p>The feature is TikTok’s latest push towards monetization and helping creators earn a living through its platform. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced</a> a $200 million fund aimed at helping creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings. TikTok also helps creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals and also provides monetization for live streams. Considering TikTok&#8217;s focus on monetization efforts, it’s no surprise that the company is experimenting with a way for creators to directly receive money from their followers.</p>
<p>TikTok also isn’t the only social media platform looking to offer creators more ways to make money, as the new Tips option is similar to Twitter’s ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a>’ feature that launched earlier this year. Similar to TikTok’s approach, Tip Jar is available to a select group of users including nonprofits, journalists, experts, and creators.</p>
<p>TikTok and Twitter&#8217;s direct tipping features appear to be a way for the companies to compete with other digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube, which offer lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event this morning, Mark Zuckerberg announced that despite a name change, Facebook Meta&#8217;s mission will remain the same and that its existing brands wouldn&#8217;t be changing. “To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event this morning, Mark Zuckerberg announced that despite a name change, <del>Facebook</del> Meta&#8217;s mission will remain the same and that its existing brands wouldn&#8217;t be changing.</p>
<p>“To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands — they’re not changing either,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that&#8217;s not so true. In a lengthy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">Facebook post</a>, CTO-in-waiting Andrew Bosworth detailed about 15 minutes later following the completion of the keynote that as part of the new rebrand, they will be killing off the Oculus brand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oculus phrasing was conspicuously absent from the presentations today and features like the Oculus Store were consistently referred to as the Quest Store. In his post, Bosworth details that starting early next year the process to rename the Oculus app to the Meta app and the Oculus Quest to the Meta Quest will begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make. While we’re retiring the name, I can assure you that the original Oculus vision remains deeply embedded in how Meta will continue to drive mass adoption for VR today,&#8221; Bosworth wrote.</p>
<p>Facebook bought Oculus VR back in 2014.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.swap.financial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swap</a>, a São Paulo-based BaaS startup, announced today it has raised $25 million in a Series A led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing was “heavily oversubscribed,” according to the company, which has now raised $28 million since its October 2018 inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Endeavor, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, partners of DST Global, ONEVC, Global Founders Capital and Flourish Ventures all participated in the latest round. Previous backers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canary and other angels such as Ariel Lambrecht, co-founder of 99 &#8211; the first Brazilian unicorn and Guilherme Bonifácio, iFood’s co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Douglas Storf, Ury Rappaport and Alexandre Takinami, Swap aims to empower companies to transform their financial operations via its APIs, which it says offers users “the infrastructure for various financial solutions, allowing them to monetize their platforms.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspiration behind Swap came from Storf and Rappaport&#8217;s own experience at 99 (formerly known as 99Taxis), where the two sought to create a series of financial products for the transport app&#8217;s partner drivers. It was there that the pair recognized the opportunity for an infrastructure service that would help any company provide financial products for their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap’s growth as of late has been impressive. Over the past year, it has seen its customer base expand by 300%. During that same timeframe, it has been consistently growing 30% per month and 7,500% year-over-year with profitable results in the third quarter, according to Swap CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas Storf. (Of course, we don’t know the base from which it grew, but the multiples are noteworthy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve demonstrated product-market fit and are helping more and more companies embed finance offerings into their products,” Storf said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap operates in its home country of Brazil, and is looking to use its capital to expand the use cases it serves there. The company aims to specialize by segment, from a market and a technological perspective. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have always sought to be a fully integrated solution that truly allows companies to launch their fintechs quickly and efficiently,” said Storf. “Rather than being just a card processor, we specialized in providing the full solution to specific segments, being at the same time their bin sponsor, their card processor, their partner bank and providing all the core infrastructure to make them operational.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says that full-service approach sets Swap apart from other BaaS companies in the market. The company also has a strategy around solving the pains of specific segments. For example, it launched Multiflex in early 2021, an offering aimed at flexible benefits companies and in September 2021, the Swap Credit platform, aimed at companies in that segment. In short, the company aims to be “LatAm’s fintech factory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently working with 15 customers such as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Swile, Portão 3, Z1, BMP Money Plus and A55. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Storf notes that its customers are expanding to other Latin American countries so it will be a natural evolution to grow into new markets outside of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap started 2021 with 27 employees and today it has 60 employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It expects to double that number in 2022 with its new capital hiring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">across product development, operations and sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Partner Alex Cook notes that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of fintech companies and use cases in Latin America has “increased dramatically, lowering costs and improving experiences for consumers and businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are thrilled to partner with Doug, Ury, and the Swap team as they build a modern card issuing and banking infrastructure platform for the next generation of financial services companies in Brazil,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing marks Global Founder Capital’s third time investing in Swap. Says Partner  Fabricio Pettená: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swap has completely reinvented banking as a service in Brazil, going beyond card</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptance and into credit and vertical solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Yoshimura, general partner and co-founder of ONEVC points out that Swap today, has two major products: card-as-a-service and infrastructure for credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, they plan to listen to their customers&#8217; needs to develop the other building blocks,” he said. “With three former CTOs in the core team, I believe they have the right DNA to build AWS for fintechs in Latam.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook (aka &#8220;Meta&#8221;) CEO Mark Zuckerberg today took several thinly veiled shots at Apple and the overall app ecosystem when detailing his plans for the metaverse during today&#8217;s keynote speech at the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect 2021 event. Specifically, he called out app platforms and their associated fees for &#8220;stifling innovation,&#8221; while simultaneously justifying Facebook&#8217;s plans [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">aka &#8220;Meta&#8221;</a>) CEO Mark Zuckerberg today took several thinly veiled shots at Apple and the overall app ecosystem when detailing his plans for the metaverse during today&#8217;s keynote speech at the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect 2021 event. Specifically, he called out app platforms and their associated fees for &#8220;stifling innovation,&#8221; while simultaneously justifying Facebook&#8217;s plans to keep some of its own fees higher as it further invests in its burgeoning VR ecosystem and its Oculus Quest Store.</p>
<p>His statements follow Apple&#8217;s recent app privacy changes that have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-q-3-earnings-investors-eye-fallout-from-whistleblower-apple-privacy-changes-175203219.html">taken a toll on</a> Facebook&#8217;s ads business. With the release of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency</a>, Apple now allows consumers to stop apps from tracking them across other apps and websites. But this change has dragged down Facebook&#8217;s revenue, the company has admitted.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook sees the potential in building out its own app platform with Oculus to create a new stream of revenue &#8212; one where it becomes the platform that profits, instead of the developer having to pay the commissions. And one where its business can&#8217;t be destroyed at the whims of another company&#8217;s shift in strategy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged that it&#8217;s time to make this change, saying that he&#8217;s learned in recent years that &#8220;building products isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We also need to help build ecosystems so that millions of people can have a stake in the future can be rewarded for their work and benefit as the tide rises &#8212; not just as consumers, but as creators and developers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This period has also been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we&#8217;ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,&#8221; Zuckerberg continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I&#8217;ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>These comments seem directly pointed at Apple and Google, on whose platforms Facebook&#8217;s core products largely reside. Facebook has to pay fees on in-app purchases to the app stores &#8212; including when users subscribe to creators, buy badges, or tip streamers directly, for example. While both Apple and Google have been bringing their commissions down for smaller businesses, media providers, and subscription apps, the standard split is still 70/30 (platform/developer).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>App Store rules have also prevented Facebook from building out other products where it could have increased revenues &#8212; as with its newer gaming service.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios">slammed Apple&#8217;s policies last year</a> as it launched Facebook Gaming on iOS without games, for example. Apple doesn&#8217;t allow apps that contain other apps or games, as that would cut into its own ability to generate revenues from third-party developers. So instead of being able to play mini-games as on Android, Facebook Gaming iOS users could only watch streams.</p>
<p>However, the real concern for Facebook&#8217;s future is one where its ad revenues are threatened by platform policy changes out of its control.</p>
<p>Those revenues over the years have allowed Facebook to invest in other sectors, in addition to keeping its apps free, Zuckerberg noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We offer our creator and commerce tools either at cost or with modest fees to enable as much creation and commerce as possible. And it&#8217;s worked. Billions of people love our products,&#8221; he touted. &#8220;We have hundreds of millions of businesses on our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company now plans to take the same approach to build its metaverse ecosystem &#8212; by either subsidizing devices or selling them at cost, to make them more broadly available to consumers, Zuckerberg said. And unlike with Apple&#8217;s App Store, Facebook says it plans to support sideloading and linking to PCs to provide consumers and developers with choice, instead of locking them into its platform. (Of course, many developers will choose to launch on the Quest Store for discovery&#8217;s sake, which is why Facebook knows it can make this promise.)</p>
<p>He also said that Facebook would keep developer and creator service fees low, when possible. However, Zuckerberg &#8212; sketching out the company&#8217;s next business model &#8212; warned that won&#8217;t always be the case. Given the size of its investment in this new ecosystem, some fees would remain higher, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep investing in this future, we&#8217;ll need to keep some fees higher for some period to make sure that we don&#8217;t lose too much money on this program overall,&#8221; Zuckerberg explained. &#8220;After all, while a growing number of developers are already profitable, we expect to invest many billions of dollars for years to come before the metaverse reaches scale. Our hope, though, is that if we all work at it that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Facebook&#8217;s plan is to become more like Apple by tapping into developer revenues at scale and making its own rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia hosted a private, sponsored AMA for founders in Startup Battlefield and Startup Alley at the virtual Disrupt SF last month. Stephanie Zhan, Konstantine Buhler, George Robson and Josephine Chen shared some key insights and best practices. It was good stuff, so we wanted to share. We took some highlights from the session and chatted with a couple more partners to dive deeper into what founders need to know &#8212; how to ask for help, fundraising principles, how to build company culture and more.</span></p>
<p><b>Fundraising requires the stars to align</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve sat on both the founder side and investor side, what is one thing you wish you could have told your founder self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: I think most founders don’t appreciate how random fundraising is. Having sat in the room for five years now, it really requires the stars to align for an investment to happen. It requires finding a champion &#8212; in order to find a champion you have to find them at the right time. Maybe they have done two other investments this year. They feel too busy. They take on board seats and don’t have the bandwidth when you meet with them. Or you’re catching them on a bad day. Or it’s an industry they had invested in previously with a company that didn’t work. There is a lot of randomness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm can feel like their investment pace is too high because they invested in three companies the week prior. So now the week you’re pitching them, they feel like the pace is too high, so the bar is now higher than it was a week ago. Ninety percent of the time it’s randomness and it’s not you. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are things a founder can do to prepare for when the stars align?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: If someone is going to join the board of your company, it’s a long-term partnership. It’s a 10+ year commitment. A lot of founders think they should only meet VCs in the fundraising process. They want to hold the meetings when they have the deck ready. Of the 15 boards I’ve been on, I’ve only invested in one founder, where I met them within the month of the investment process. All of the others, I met them three months before they came to raise. Personally, if I’m entering into a long-term relationship, I want to know them as a person and get longitudinal data. I want to see how they have been performing over time. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you say to founders who are not “typical founders”? How do you break through the pattern-matching framework some VCs have in their head?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: Identify your high-level ambition to start a company, and then work backwards. If that’s my goal, what are the stepping stones I need to get there? I personally had a 1.0 GPA in high school and had to recover from that. I thought a lot about stepping stone paths. I wanted to go to a good college&#8230;so I went to community college first. I thought about: How am I going to stand out? I need to go do something crazy and stand out. I need to do something different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reverse engineer it. Are there any immediate things I, as a founder, can do that are stepping stones to the bigger goals. Second piece, be really persistent. And it’s not what people want to hear. With Escape Dynamics [Shaun Maguire’s first company], we had to pitch 100 investors and eventually found one that would work with us. </span></p>
<p><b>Tactics to prepare for fundraising</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a challenge to raise. What do you do when you don’t have a lead and you need a lead? How do you cross that bridge?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhan: Treat fundraising as you would recruiting critical team members. It’s invaluable to find the right partner, especially at the very beginning of the company. I like to think of it as a compass: A small degree change in the direction of your company in month one has an outsized impact on where you will be 10 years out. If it&#8217;s a challenge to raise and you don&#8217;t have a lead investor, I would evaluate whether additional capital is absolutely necessary, and if so, how much the company truly needs. The earliest rounds are the most expensive dilution for a founder — and will only compound over the years — so it’s important to raise as much as the company requires to grow and strive for a lead investor that can have a transformative impact over the long term. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should a founder turn down an investment even if they are running out of runway?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhan: The value of having the right partners — a strong brand and network, a team who rolls up their sleeves alongside you, and someone who cares about you as a person and founder — compounds over time and provides incredible signaling for your company. The reverse is also true. There are lots of options for capital these days; it&#8217;s up to founders to recognize the ones who offer real value, not valuation. Always ask yourself: Can this partner truly add value and help me bend the arc of my company? Cut through the marketing noise by talking to founders who have worked with that partner over years. Ask about the good and bad times, as well as the successful and less successful outcomes  — this will help you truly discern the differences among investors. Think about which partner you want by your side for the next 10-20 years and who you want to turn to during the highs and lows of your company-building journey. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What recommendations do you have for founders who are on the cutting edge of things that investors may not know how to invest in or may not understand the space of?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: It’s really important to understand the [min rule decision making] psychology and that’s what you’re dealing with as a founder because it can change the tactics that you use. It’s hard when you are doing something cutting edge because there is less pattern matching for everyone in the partnership. First you need to find a champion and then you need to find the most negative person in the firm and try to win them over. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a previous startup failure factor into your decision to invest in a new company?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: A startup can fail for a variety of reasons, so we check any bias at the door by decoupling the success or failure of a business from the quality of the team. When we partner with a second-time founder, we talk a lot about their former experience to gauge their ability to reflect and carry those learnings into a new chapter. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are other success markers outside revenue that you look for in early-stage startups?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhan: We look for founders who are building companies that will become generational and shape history. The most important thing we look for is a special team: one that deeply understands the problem they are solving, has a unique and compelling insight that’s shaped their way of going about the problem, has grit and ambition to take them through the long haul, and has commercial instincts to understand how a compelling product can be over time to become an enduring, independent business.</span></p>
<p><b>Running a successful startup</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s one of the hardest parts for founders building companies in the early stage?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Early-stage startups have an abundance of choice, yet they also have finite resources. It’s important for founders to prioritize in a thoughtful way. For example, when looking to expand internationally, focus on the key questions that matter, such as: ‘who are your customers?’ and ‘where can you build a repeatable GTM function?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should a founder talk to an investor about issues/red flags/problems?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Similar to other relationships in life, the connection between an investor and founder is built on trust. Founders should be transparent with their investors and feel safe flagging issues early so they can help troubleshoot. If we&#8217;ve done our job well, nothing we discuss at a board meeting should ever be a surprise, as we&#8217;re supporting our founders to build their businesses everyday.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At what point does someone deserve a co-founder title?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jess Lee: There’s no ‘one path’ to finding or becoming a co-founder. I was retroactively made a co-founder of Polyvore as the founders felt I deserved it based on my contributions — and that’s always meant a lot to me. I was technically the first hire and not there from day one, but I acted like an owner, poured my heart and soul into the work and helped shape the culture. In the end, I was also just lucky that Pasha, Guangwei and Jianing were generous people who went out of their way to give me the title and even some of their own shares. I&#8217;ll always be grateful for that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culture comes up a lot. Thoughts? What are the two main tactical steps companies can take to build a strong culture in the beginning?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Don&#8217;t compromise on people. Put culture first at your company and codify your culture early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jess Lee: It’s never too early to define your culture. In fact, in our Company Design Program — which gives early-stage founders the learnings and community to build an enduring company — we provide founders with a framework for culture: values → behaviors → stories. Values are the fundamental beliefs and guiding principles of the company, ideally stated in a pithy, memorable way. Behaviors are how you want to see people act, based on those values. Stories are the real-life anecdotes of when your company lived those values. The stories are especially important, since that&#8217;s what people remember. They help make the company culture tangible and easier to operationalize. As an example, people know the story of the Airbnb founders selling cereal to make ends meet or of Jeff Bezos using doors for desks, which embody their values of entrepreneurship and frugality, respectively.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">International travel is slowly opening up again, but that also means business and leisure travelers alike will once again have to think about visa restrictions as they take to the air. Nobody has ever enjoyed the process of applying for a visa, but <a href="https://www.atlys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlys</a> promises to take the hassle out of the process. The company today announced that it has raised a $4.25 million seed funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Pinterest co-founders Ben Silbermann and Evan Sharp also participated in this round, together with The Chainsmokers’ Mantis VC (yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0fBr1XBUA">those Chainsmokers</a>), Long Journey Ventures, South Park Commons Fund and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor.</p>
<p>Atlys argues that it can take travelers up to 13 hours to work through the visa process for various countries &#8212; and that&#8217;s without trying to figure out the ever-changing COVID testing and vaccination requirements. While most business travelers work with agencies that speed up this process by quite a bit, especially for repeat applications, Atlys promises to bring the process down to five minutes.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atlys-simplify-travel/id1514036839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s iPhone app</a>, travelers answer a few questions about their travels (where you are, where you are going, why you are traveling, etc.) and scan their documents. There are some smart integrations here, too, with the ability to take passport photos and then pick them up at Walgreens (or get delivery) or to ask your manager for a letter of employment signed through DocuSign.</p>
<p>Pricing depends on where you are and where you are going, but it tops out at about $50.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Mohak Nahta, who came to the U.S. as an immigrant himself. &#8220;I am thrilled to have such an incredible group of investors supporting <span class="il">Atlys</span> and our mission,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is with their invaluable experience and guidance that will propel us further in our quest to simplify travel and create a seamless process for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to build out its team and expand its coverage across more country pairs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we look for in founders is &#8216;founder-product fit&#8217;, meaning does the founder have a unique insight into the market or problem they are trying to solve? As an immigrant myself, I immediately appreciated how deeply and personally Mohak also understood the cumbersome visa process, and how he was leveraging his insights to build Atlys,&#8221; said Sriram Krishnan, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. &#8220;The magic of Atlys lies in its ability to connect many disparate systems behind the scenes, while offering a simple, streamlined end-customer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, it&#8217;s official. After 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus has a new name.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s corporate entity is now Meta.</p>
<p>Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company&#8217;s core ambition: to build the metaverse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same &#8212; it&#8217;s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands &#8212; they&#8217;re not changing either,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;From now on, we&#8217;re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O0x3x29QYd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off &#8216;Oculus&#8217; brand</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off &#8216;Oculus&#8217; brand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/embed/#?secret=O0x3x29QYd" data-secret="O0x3x29QYd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The name change comes at a&#8230; convenient time for Facebook, which has seen a sustained backlash to its brand, particularly in recent weeks after a former employee leaked a trove of documents to the media and government bodies detailing the missteps Facebook has made over the years in building out its platform responsibly. Facebook had been laying the groundwork for this change for months, seemingly in an effort to move its core branding further from the relentless negative headlines surrounding its most popular product, which has been a lightning rod for angst among consumers.</p>
<p>In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">Verge</a> profile that Facebook was betting it all on the metaverse. It was a surprise announcement for the trillion-dollar company, mainly because while Facebook has spent plenty of money and effort on virtual reality hardware, its social VR products have largely been short-lived failures and it had said barely anything about its beta Horizons social platform since announcing it more than a year-and-a-half earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August, Facebook organized an unusually large press push around a VR app designed to let people take meetings in VR. Zuckerberg hit the morning shows and dedicated a surprising amount of effort toward showcasing the small VR app.</p>
<p>In September, in a blog post called &#8220;Building the Metaverse Responsibly,&#8221; Facebook announced a $50 million fund dedicated toward investment in research &#8220;to ensure these products are developed responsibly.&#8221; This month, Facebook announced a smaller $10 million creator fund for developers on its nascent Horizon Worlds platform, and also detailed that it planned to hire a whopping 10,000 employees in the EU specifically to build out their metaverse platform.</p>
<p>Last week, a story in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> floated that Facebook was mulling a name change to their corporate entity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, distancing the company&#8217;s core business from a product associated with the most problems is an unsurprising move for them, but changing its name to Meta will require Facebook to align its core brand with a product that could be years from relevancy and could encounter many failures on the way to potential mainstream success. Facebook still has 2.5 billion users, while their metaverse products likely have a few thousand users, at most.</p>
<p>A major name change from one of tech’s biggest companies isn’t without precedent. In 2015, Google rolled out a new corporate structure of its own, creating a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/02/google-becomes-alphabet/">parent company known as Alphabet</a>. Google remains a subsidiary of Alphabet, but colloquially most people still call anything having to do with the company or its subsidiaries &#8220;Google,&#8221; for better or worse. After almost two decades of building its brand and growing its products to almost three billion monthly users, Facebook can probably expect the same treatment.</p>
<p>While Google wasn’t trying to put distance between itself and its own name, Facebook has very different reasons for a rebrand. The company’s business continues to soar, but its brand has taken a beating in recent years, from Russian election disinformation in 2016, to major privacy lapses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and now the flurry of ongoing revelations from Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook’s civic integrity team turned Facebook whistleblower.</p>
<p>Facebook is also arguably under more regulatory scrutiny at the moment than any other company in the tech industry. In Congress, where lawmakers seldom agree on anything, Republicans and Democrats have united in their shared distaste for the company’s unfettered growth, cutthroat business tactics and concerns over Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen mental health.</p>
<p>During a Senate hearing last week with TikTok, Snap and YouTube, each social media company scrambled to explicitly contrast their own business practices with Facebook. YouTube posited that it didn’t “prioritize profits over safety.” Snap pointed to its own focus on ephemeral conversations, while TikTok argued that it thinks carefully about the wellbeing of teen users. But the efforts by Facebook’s peers appeared to be in vain.</p>
<p>“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. “That bar is in the gutter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tenways.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenways</a> is an e-bike maker which has launched its first model, the CGO 600, on Indiegogo. Priced at around $1,400 this is a relatively affordable e-bike in the scheme of things, and has plenty of features to satisfy even the most discerning of customers.</p>
<p>Now before we get into it, it behooves me to say that there is always an inherent risk when buying into new products promoted on crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tenways-ebike-the-best-urban-ride-ever#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where the CGO 600 is listed</a>.</p>
<p>However, the good news is that Tenways is adamant that its bikes are already rolling off production, and this, evidently, appears to be the case. Certainly, the review model I was sent attested to this claim, as it came with all the full and final hardware listed on the site. Furthermore, Tenways is an established company that uses Indiegogo in a marketing manner, largely to advertise its bike, rather than raise money to develop and build it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2225913" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225913" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225913 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg 1807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225913" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tenways</p></div></p>
<p>So, is this urban electric bicycle worth your consideration? The short answer is yes.</p>
<p>Here’s the longer answer:</p>
<p>First of all, we are talking about an e-bike optimized for the urban environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It certainly looks like it’s built for the city. The electric motor and battery are more discreet than in other e-bikes, giving it that cool, messenger-bike styling. The carbon belt-drive system means it is quieter and more maintenance-free, as these do not need oiling or adjusting. Similarly, the hydraulic disc brake system is not going to require much maintenance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225912" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225912" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225912 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222287.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222287.jpg 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222287.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222287.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222287.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225912" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tenways</p></div></p>
<p>The bike rides well, and at only 33 lb (15 kg), it is easy to pick up to carry up or downstairs. As there is no throttle, the pedal assist is activated by a torque sensor, which works well.</p>
<p>The 250W motor is enough to give you that extra boost as you ride up a hill or on the flat, but you also have three power levels to pick from.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225911" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225911" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225911 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222286.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222286.jpg 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222286.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222286.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tenways-C-GO-600-Electric-Bike-Price-UK-IndieGogo-Campaign-Buy-Price-Release-Get-Now-3222286.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225911" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tenways</p></div></p>
<p>With its relatively small 252 Wh battery, Tenways claims the bike has a range of 80 miles (130 km) per charge in “ideal conditions”, which is probably optimistic. But then who rides 130 km on a commute? After all, this is really what this bike is designed for. Removing the battery for charging is not easy, so it will be simpler to charge the bike in situ.</p>
<p>Tenways has been shipping from September, and who wouldn’t want a good-looking e-bike with these features, be they an &#8220;urban&#8221; hipster or an average commuter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants the Quest 2 to be known as more than a game console for your face.</p>
<p>At the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect developer conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the company&#8217;s efforts to make the Quest a fitness platform for third-party apps like Supernatural and FitXR. He compared it directly to the Peloton as a connected fitness device.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of you are already using Quest to stay fit, it lets you work out in some completely new ways,&#8221; Zuckerberg said in the keynote. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like a Peloton, but instead of your bike you just have your VR headset and with it, you can do anything from boxing lessons to sword-fighting to even dancing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is leaning further into this classification with its hardware detailing that next year they will release an &#8220;Active Pack&#8221; that allows users to customize their Quest 2 headset to make it better featured for working out. The pack will add grips to the controllers and a facial pad that addresses the issue of sweaty headsets.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company began pushing fitness harder in-headset, showcasing a product called Oculus Move that measures activity and calorie-burning tracking into the Quest 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are lots of startups now working on modular home design. Among the most interesting is <a href="https://buildcover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cover</a>, a seven-year-old, LA-based company that says it manufactures fully complete wall, floor and roof panels in its factory, then transports them on a standard truck and assembles them on site &#8212; without a crane.</p>
<p>The materials it is using are lightweight steel for the building frame and aluminum for the ceilings. The panels are made of a rubber composite because, as founder and CEO Alexis Xavier Rivas explains, &#8220;drywall is not designed for manufacturing or transport &#8212; it&#8217;s too brittle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of thought has been invested in how these buildings are designed. For example, the company installs all plumbing and electrical wiring in the ceiling, so that if an owner wants to run a new wire or pipe, she or he need only pop off the ceiling to do it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It sounds strange, but it&#8217;s a lot less strange than sawing a series of holes in a wall, then patching them up and repainting them to achieve the same end. (It also requires less help from craftspeople like plumbers and electricians, who are in short supply right now.)</p>
<p>Other materials used include real wood and wood composites for the floors and exterior, and solid surface countertops and bathroom floors that are nonporous, meaning they&#8217;re more hygienic, as these things go, which matters increasingly to homeowners as the world emerges from a pandemic.</p>
<p>How the materials come together is naturally even more crucial, given that with Cover, much of the focus &#8212; and the promise &#8212; is on both quick assembly and customization.</p>
<p>According to Rivas, the process works as follows: A customer works with the company to create a design. Right now, that design is limited to single-story units that are 1,200-square-feet or smaller but which take into account factors such as where windows should be placed to minimize energy waste. (Rivas also notes here that the windows, made by Cover, are LEED-certified, and that its homes are airtight, vastly improving their energy efficiency.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cover then takes the agreed-upon design, at a price that&#8217;s established up front and includes permitting fees, city fees, foundation fees and the home itself &#8212; think $200,000 for 400-square-foot studio; $250,000 for a 600-square-foot, one-bedroom unit; and up to $500,000 for a 1,200-square-foot one-bedroom dwelling &#8212; and it gets to work engineering the pieces.</p>
<p>Somewhat amazingly, it says that after the foundation is complete, it can have the building built and installed within 30 days, down from the 120-window that it used to promise customers.</p>
<p>It also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if it can&#8217;t obtain the <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/building-standards/manufactured-modular-factory-built/factory-built-housing.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary permits</a>, along with a lifetime structural warranty and a one-year warranty for everything else.</p>
<p>These buildings are &#8220;not going to rot,&#8221; says Rivas. &#8220;They aren&#8217;t going to be eaten by termites.&#8221; If a customer needs new air filters, on the other hand, &#8220;we&#8217;ll change them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivas, who grew up in Toronto, studied architecture in college and bounced briefly around a number of architectural firms before founding Cover, takes pride in being able to attract engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to the mission, and at various points during a conversation earlier this week, likened Cover&#8217;s processes to that of the automaker.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s seemingly not the only one who sees similarities. The company is today announcing that it has raised $60 million in Series B funding led by Gigafund, an investment firm that was founded by two former Founders Fund investors who have bet heavily on SpaceX.</p>
<p>Joining the round are Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund &#8212; both of which are also early investors in SpaceX and Tesla &#8212; and a whole bunch of other notable backers, including General Catalyst, Lennar, Fifty Years, AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca, Marathon Asset Management CEO Bruce Richards and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, among others.</p>
<p>Certainly, there&#8217;s no dearth of demand for what Cover is building, given the national housing &#8212; and construction &#8212; shortage. In fact, asked about Cover&#8217;s sales team, Rivas says that there is so much inbound interest that just &#8220;one-third of one person&#8217;s time is in sales&#8221; right now.</p>
<p>As for what people are ordering, Rivas says that most of the company&#8217;s customers have bought dwellings to accommodate either family moving in (an aging parent, a kid coming back from college); to create a home office apart from their house; or to establish a way to drum up rental income.</p>
<p>Still, beyond the roughly 20 backyard homes it has already built, the company &#8212; which has now raised $75 million altogether &#8212; very much intends to begin building bigger, multilevel homes, as well as multifamily units.</p>
<p>It mostly boils down to using more panels, Rivas says, which the company will be able to produce from the 100,000-square-foot factory into which it&#8217;s moving from the 25,000-square-foot warehouse it operates currently. (That&#8217;s where some of that $60 million is headed.)</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, if all goes as planned, sometime soon, even existing customers will be able to easily enlarge the homes they&#8217;ve already bought using the Cover app. It&#8217;ll be a snap, by his telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go on the app, you&#8217;ll click on the room to which you want to add, then schedule it, pay online, and get your renovation done in two to three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of curtain raiser for which Elon Musk is known. Now to see if Cover can pull it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">announced</a> last month it would soon introduce an option that allows hosts to record their live audio sessions in Twitter Spaces to make them available for replay. While the company at the time said the feature would launch in a &#8220;few months,&#8221; it&#8217;s not surprising that, given Twitter&#8217;s accelerated pace of development, the company is rolling out its first iteration of the feature starting today.</p>
<p>Initially, the Spaces Recording option will be will made available to a limited number of Twitter Spaces hosts on iOS and all listeners on iOS and Android worldwide. Twitter says the first users to receive access will be those who were in the original Spaces Beta. It will then roll out the feature to the rest of the Twitter audience in a few more weeks, the company says.</p>
<p>To use the feature, a Spaces host will create their live audio room by giving their Space a title and selecting up to three tags to describe what the room&#8217;s about, as usual. They can then toggle on the new setting, &#8220;Record Space,&#8221; before tapping on the &#8220;Start a Space&#8221; button to begin their live audio session.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225636" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If in a Twitter Space that&#8217;s being recorded, participants will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it at the top of the Space as an indication that the recording is underway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225666" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225666" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2225666" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225666" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>When the host is ready to end the Space, they&#8217;ll tap on the &#8220;End&#8221; button at the top-right as they would otherwise, and will then be presented with a pop-up box that asks them to confirm they want to end both the Space and stop the recording.</p>
<p>Once wrapped, the recording of the Space can be shared across Twitter&#8217;s platform, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves. Twitter does not yet have an audio export option available, we&#8217;re told. Instead, users would have to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterMedia/status/1405262233299345413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request a download of their data</a> to access the recordings directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live audio grew in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic surged, as it gave something for locked-down users to do while stuck at home. But the appeal has <a href="https://variety.com/vip/clubhouse-has-cooled-off-in-the-u-s-heres-why-it-shouldnt-panic-1235050042/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat</a> dwindled as COVID restrictions lifted and people began to venture back out. Popular live audio app Clubhouse, for example, saw app <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/22/clubhouse-app-over/">installs decline</a> earlier this year, but <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/clubhouse-downloads-pace-jump-179-230212153.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump again</a> with an Android release. However, the app also faced lagging engagement in some emerging markets, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/has-clubhouse-plateaued-before-it-hit-the-peak-11631816511362.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like India</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a> with its creator program.</p>

<p>Recently, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its feature set to offer options that would allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays and audio exports &#8212; tools that are pushing the app closer to being a podcast creation platform, rather than just a live audio network. (It&#8217;s actually a wonder Apple hasn&#8217;t snatched it up to become an in-house rival to Spotify&#8217;s Anchor.)</p>
<p>Other Twitter Spaces&#8217; competitors, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1322627964798415/?helpref=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook&#8217;s Live Audio Rooms</a> and newer startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/mark-cuban-backed-live-entertainment-app-fireside-launches-to-creators/">Fireside</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a>, also support audio recordings.</p>
<p>With so much of the live audio landscape now embracing recordings, Twitter had to catch up.</p>
<p>The release follows shortly after a few other updates to Twitter Spaces, including <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453449025877942288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday&#8217;s launch</a> of a Spaces test that brings the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated Spaces Tab</a> to Android users and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447639305397194755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update bringing easier DM invites</a>. Twitter will also now <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453446589817704451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature popular Spaces</a> in the Explore / Trending tab on iOS to increase their visibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vsc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSC</a>, a public relations firm that has helped the likes of startups such as ClearCo, Poshmark and Tile craft their stories, has raised millions to invest in the companies they work with. While <a href="http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2767/186454721000002/filing-main.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its bigger fund is estimated to close at $20 million</a>, VSC confirmed that it has raised a $7 million tranche for climate tech startups to start.</p>
<p>VSC Ventures will back early-stage companies with checks between $250,000 to $500,000, and also provide media relations and multimedia content development as a service. The venture arm will be run by VSC CEO Vijay Chattha and General Partner Jay Kapoor, who was recently hired by VSC off of his six-years investing experience.</p>
<p>For VSC, which has helped more than 500 venture-backed startups through 50 exits, 20 unicorns and four IPOs, the argument for its venture arm is that cutting through the noise can help folks get coveted cap table spots.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>VSC Ventures’ debut focus, climate, is related to its competitive advantage of knowing a thing or two about telling stories.<a href="https://vsc.co/climb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Climb</a>, also announced today, is VSC’s practice dedicated to building awareness and action around sustainability-focused startups. The duo thinks that, as every major VC fund begins to invest in the thorny and complicated world of climate, startups will need help explaining why their solutions make sense.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just about hyping up on Twitter &#8212; that is something everybody can do,&#8221; Kapoor said. “It&#8217;s about actually having experience working with the founders to help them with their messaging, to help them with their positioning, and actually have done that consistently over time. Maybe some platform services have a person here and there that can help companies, but that isn’t their core competency and it’s not what they&#8217;re designed for.”</p>
<p>The investors’ own personal track records don&#8217;t hurt either. Before the fund, both Chattha and Kapoor made a slew of climate-focused investments on their own, including Revel, Modumate, Zume, Poshmark, Molekule and Rocean. The firm will eventually back startups in future of work and wellness, as well.</p>
<p>As every venture firm appears to be going the full-stack approach, offering a suite of services beyond simply capital, VSC’s move feels warranted. These days, founders want valuable services from their investors, such as hiring help, or simply, hype. Those within the media have found themselves in a fortuitous, and potentially lucrative spot, as the storytelling skill set skyrockets in demand from aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Harry Stebbings, the well-known podcaster behind “20 minute VC,” recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/harry-stebbings-turns-up-the-volume-on-20vc-with-new-140m-fund/">$140 million for his venture capital fund</a> launched off of his show’s success. Morning Brew CEO Austin Rief <a href="https://angel.co/austin-riefs-rolling-fund/syndicate?utm_campaign=syndicate_direct_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fund</a> of his own. It’s happening in reverse too. Andreessen Horowitz, a more traditional fund, has put significant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/">investment into Future</a>, a media property in which it will publish stories about topics related to areas in which the firm invests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IEMZDHV4fd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/">The only take about the future of media is that media is the future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The only take about the future of media is that media is the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/embed/#?secret=IEMZDHV4fd" data-secret="IEMZDHV4fd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite the blending of media and VC, few public relations firms have raised a fund, it appears.</p>
<p>“Many firms have experimented with equity for services since the late 1990s but abandon it quickly when the startup markets slow down,” Chattha said. “We are using LP capital to back companies and therefore are committed to this approach.”</p>
<p>Fear of a bubble burst aside, another reason that PR firms may not have gone into the investment game is the sheer complexity of managing clients and portfolio companies at the same time. Will there be a tension between VSC clients and VSC portfolio companies that are competing for the same partners’ time?</p>
<p>“We get asked this a lot,” Chattha said. “While the climate tech practice comes with money, in general, a lot of our companies are beyond where we can invest in them.” Since the majority of VSC’s current clients are Series B and beyond, the new fund will only be able to put money into a fraction of clients &#8212; which helps the investors draw a line on who they will and won’t back. This could change if VSC continues to raise more funds in the future.</p>
<p>Public relations firms also sometimes work as crisis communications, helping startups better message their mistakes to investors, employees, customers and, of course, the press. One could argue that founders may feel less incentivized to be vulnerable with a PR firm about struggles if they are also their investors, the same people they are incentivized to impress.</p>
<p>“Because we&#8217;re not the lead investor, we don&#8217;t ever put that kind of peer pressure on them,” Chattha said. “We have enough skin in the game to be honest and vulnerable with them, but not so much that we&#8217;re going to guide them into the wrong for their business.”</p>
<p>The venture arm, still in its early days, wants to be clear that it’s prepared for the startup boom to quiet down &#8212; whenever that happens.</p>
<p>“We’re in an up and to the right era, but it won’t be like this forever,” Chattha said. “Every vertical has its own ups and downs&#8230; and by not being the biggest check in or the lead check in, you know, we take that pressure off.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its big VR and AR-focused event Thursday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a major new title headed to its VR platform that should turn a few heads.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is on the way to the Oculus Quest 2. San Andreas is Rockstar&#8217;s well-loved 2004 entry into the hit GTA franchise, which invites players to wreak havoc in an urban open world fashioned after cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new version of what I think is one of the greatest games ever made will offer players an entirely new way to experience this iconic world in virtual reality,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bringing such an iconic game into the fold is certainly one way to lure more users into the company&#8217;s emerging virtual world — one that even folks squeamish about Facebook&#8217;s VR account login requirements might find enticing.</p>
<p>While Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t offer many details about what to expect or when, Facebook has apparently been working on bringing the GTA classic to its VR headset for years.</p>
