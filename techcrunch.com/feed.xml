										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has long positioned itself a source for inspiration that could ultimately lead to online purchases. And over the years, it has worked on features to better connect consumers with the products and services they want to buy, like shoppable pins, visual search, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">AR try-on</a>, product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/pinterest-launches-a-today-tab-featuring-daily-recommendations-and-trending-topics/">recommendations</a>, and more. Today, the company is rolling out another feature aimed at turning users&#8217; saved Pins into purchases: a shopping list.</p>
<p>The new Pinterest Shopping list feature saves all your Product Pins in one place, so when you&#8217;re ready to purchase you won&#8217;t have to hunt around through your saved Pins and Boards to find the products you had been considering. Here, you&#8217;ll find the information you need, including an item&#8217;s price, reviews, and shipping info in an even grid so you can compare products and make decisions.</p>
<p>The feature, however, isn&#8217;t just an organizational tool &#8212; Pinterest says it will also send out notifications if the items you&#8217;ve saved have dropped in price &#8212; which could encourage users to make the purchase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Shopping List is available on your Profile page above your other boards, and will include the shoppable items you&#8217;ve saved as well as items you&#8217;ve recently viewed. When you&#8217;re ready to buy, you can click on the pin to visit the retailer&#8217;s website to complete the transaction &#8212; giving Pinterest the credit for the referral, of course.</p>
<p>The feature will launch first in the U.S. and U.K., and will later roll out to Australia, Canada, France and Germany later in the year, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>Alongside the Shopping List, Pinterest today is also expanding merchant tools with the debut of its Verified Merchant Program in the U.K., Australia, Canada, France and Germany, plus a merchant storefront on profile feature, and new product tagging in Australia, Canada, France and Germany.<a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/verified-merchant-program"> Launched last year,</a> the Verified Merchant Program offers retailers a way to sign up for a manual review to determine if they meet Pinterest&#8217;s qualifications for high-quality customer service experiences. If so, they receive a blue checkmark on their profile as a signal to consumers that they&#8217;re a trustworthy retailer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162057" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162057" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2162057" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Shopping-List-US-GIF.gif?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162057" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, the company is today launching a special two-week long Shopping Spotlight called &#8220;The Goods by Pinterest,&#8221; which offers users access to limited edition items sold by DTC brands including Brooklinen, Outdoor Voices, Clare Paint, Olive &amp; June, and Maude. And it&#8217;s running a &#8220;Shop the mood&#8221; campaign offering curated trends from its annual report, &#8220;Pinterest Predicts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Pinterest notes its users, on average, outspend non-users by 2x every month and have a 85% larger basket size, the way people want to shop online is rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Historically an image-centric idea board of sorts, Pinterest may be left behind as more consumers &#8212; and particularly younger shoppers &#8212; begin to more heavily rely on shopping via video (both recorded and live), including through influencer-driven content across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Pinterest has only more recently expanded into this area, with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">video-first &#8220;Idea Pins&#8221; last month</a> aimed at creators, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">a test of livestreamed creator events</a> around the same time.</p>
<p>The new launches follow a Pinterest earnings beat in April on both EPS and revenue (11 cents vs 7 cents expected, and $485M vs $474M expected), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/pinterest-pins-earnings-q1-2021.html">but slowing user growth</a>. The company reported 478 million monthly active users versus the 480.5 million expected, causing the stock to drop 10% after the report came out. The company blamed the decline in user growth and user engagement on the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, as consumers began to spend less time online.</p>
<p>With the new additions, Pinterest wants to better ensure those users who are on its site are not just idly browsing, but actually checking out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s broadcast regulator, the National Broadcasting Commission, has ordered all broadcasting stations in the country to suspend their use of Twitter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was issued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday morning, and the broadcasting stations include TV and radio platforms in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in,&#8221; an excerpt of the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is coming days after the country suspended Twitter operations when the micro-blogging platform deleted a controversial tweet made by President Muhammadu Buhari</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">cited</a> the micro-blogging platform&#8217;s alleged ploy to &#8216;undermine its corporate existence&#8217; as one reason for the indefinite suspension</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wbxEQ33pfz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria suspends Twitter operations, says platform &#8216;undermines its corporate existence&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/embed/#?secret=wbxEQ33pfz" data-secret="wbxEQ33pfz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside this directive was an order to the NBC to “immediately </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that is still a work in progress, Nigerians haven&#8217;t been able to use Twitter since the early hours of Saturday as telecom operators in the country restricted access to the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, most people have employed VPNs and other alternative platforms to bypass the domain restrictions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, following Nigerians disregard of the government&#8217;s order, the country&#8217;s Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, via his spokesperson, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html">issued a troubling directive</a> over the weekend</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Malami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to swing into action and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria,&#8221; the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No public arrests have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so far. And although no one is sure how the Attorney General and his cohorts will carry out that directive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are fears that the government will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illegal means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accomplish</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there has been widespread criticism of the Twitter ban, both in the country and abroad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a joint statement with the EU, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. expressed disappointment in the ban. They called out the Buhari-led administration for censorship and human right violation and requested that the Nigerian government reconsider its stance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, it appeared as though the government would budge. The president, via his spokesperson, declared that the state-wide ban on Twitter was only a temporary measure to curb misinformation and fake news</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real-world violent consequences,” the government said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allowed &#8220;the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages that could tear some countries apart&#8221;, the spokesperson added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with today&#8217;s directive, the government might be speaking out of both sides of its mouth. The statement released referenced section 5.6.3 of the NBC Act to the role it believes Twitter plays in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadcasting code &#8220;requires broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a user-generated content (UGC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulator didn&#8217;t forget to leave a subtle warning stating that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in the country to continue patronising Twitter as a source of information</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Instead, a merely supercharged version will come out. It&#8217;s still stupid fast and expensive. And <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/nigerian-twitter-ban-how-government-restriction-affects-people">Nigeria&#8217;s war with Twitter continued</a>, with new efforts from the African nation to limit access to the social media service within its borders.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The medical industry is sitting on a huge trove of data, but in many cases it can be a challenge to realize the value of it because that data is unstructured and in disparate places.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.mendel.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mendel</a>, which has built an AI platform both to ingest and bring order to that body of information, is announcing $18 million in funding to continue its growth and to build out what it describes as a &#8220;clinical data marketplace&#8221; for people not just to organize, but also to share and exchange that data for research purposes. It&#8217;s also going to be using the funding to hire more talent &#8212; technical and support &#8212; for its two offices, in San Jose, CA and Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The Series A round is being led by DCM, with&nbsp;OliveTree and MTVLP, and previous backers Launch Capital, SOSV, Bootstrap Labs and Chairman of UCSF Health Hub Mark Goldstein also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of what Mendel says is a surge of interest among research and pharmaceutical companies in sourcing better data to gain a better understanding of longer-term patient care and progress, in particular across wider groups of users, not just at a time when it has been more challenging to observe people and run trials, but in light of the understanding that using AI to leverage much bigger data sets can produce better insights.</p>
<p>This can be important, for example, in proactive identifying symptoms of particular ailments or the pathology of a disease, but also recurring and more typical responses to specific treatment courses.</p>
<p>We previously wrote about Mendel back in 2017 when the company had received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/01/mendel-ai-nabs-2-million-to-match-cancer-patients-with-the-latest-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $2 million</a> to better match cancer patients with the various clinical trials that are regularly being run: the idea was that certain trials address specific types of cancers and types of patients, and those who are willing to try newer approaches will be better or worse suited to each of these.</p>
<p>It turned out, however, that Mendel discovered a problem in the data that it would have needed to enable its matching algorithms to work, said Dr. Karim Galil, Mendel&#8217;s CEO and founder.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;As we were trying to build the trial business, we discovered a more basic problem that hadn’t been solved,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;It was the reading and understanding medical records of a patient. If you can’t do that you can’t do trial matching.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So the startup decided to become an R&amp;D shop for at least three years to solve that problem before doing anything with trials, he continued.</p>
<p>Although there are today many AI companies that are parsing unstructured information in order to extract better insights, Mendel is what you might think of as part of the guard of tech companies that are building out specific AI knowledge bases for distinct verticals or areas of expertise. (Another example from another vertical is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/eigen-nabs-37m-to-help-banks-and-others-parse-huge-documents-using-natural-language-and-small-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eigen, working in the legal and finance industries</a>, while Google&#8217;s DeepMind is another major AI player looking at ways of better harnessing data in the sphere of medicine.)</p>
<p>The issue of &#8220;reading&#8221; natural language is more nuanced than you might think in the world of medicine. Gali compared it to the phrase &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave you&#8221; in English, which could just as easily mean someone is departing, say, a room, as someone is walking out of a relationship. The &#8220;true&#8221; answer &#8212; and as we humans know even truth can be elusive &#8212; can only start to be found in the context.</p>
<p>The same goes for doctors and their observation notes, Galil said. &#8220;There is a lot hidden between the lines, and problems can be specific to a person,&#8221; or to a situation.</p>
<p>That has proven to be a lucrative area to tackle.</p>
<p>Mendel uses a mix of computer vision and natural language processing built by teams with extensive experience in both clinical environments and in building AI algorithms and currently provides tools to automate clinical data abstraction, OCR, special tools to redact and remove personal identifiable information automatically to share records, search engines to search clinical data, and &#8212; yes &#8212; an engine to enable better matching of people to clinical trials. Customers include pharmaceutical and life science companies, real-world data and real-world evidence (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/real-world-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RWD and RWE</a>) providers and research groups.</p>
<p>And to underscore just how much there is still left to do in the world of medicine, along with this funding round, Mendel is announcing a partnership with eFax, an online faxing solution used by a huge number of healthcare providers.</p>
<p>Faxing is totally antiquated in some parts of the world now &#8212; I&#8217;m not even sure that people the age of my children (tweens) even know what a &#8220;fax&#8221; is &#8212; but they remain one of the most-used ways to transfer documents and information between people in the worlds of healthcare and medicine, with 90% of the industry using them today. The partnership with Mendel will mean that those eFaxes will now be &#8220;read&#8221; and digitized and ingested into wider platforms to tap that data in a more useful way.</p>
<p class="p1">“There is huge potential for the global healthcare industry to leverage AI,” said Mendel board member and partner at DCM, Kyle Lui, in a statement. “Mendel has created a unique and seamless solution for healthcare organizations to automatically make sense of their clinical data using AI. We look forward to continuing to work with the team on this next stage of growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen-based generators are an environmentally-friendly alternative to ones powered by diesel fuel. But many rely on solar, hydro or wind power, which aren’t available all the time. Brisbane-based <a href="https://www.endua.com/">Endua</a> is making hydrogen-based power generators more accessible by using electrolysis to create more hydrogen and storing it for long-term use. The startup’s technology was developed at CSIRO, Australian’s national science agency, and is being commercialized by Main Sequence, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">venture fund founded by CSIRO </a>and Ampol, one of the country’s largest fuel companies.</p>
<p>Main Sequence’s venture science model means that it first identifies a global challenge, then brings together the technology, team and investors to launch a startup that can address that problem. Through the program, Paul Sernia, the founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/ev-fast-charger-developer-tritium-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-at-1-2b-valuation/">electric vehicle charger maker Tritium</a>, was brought on to serve as Endua’s chief executive officer, working with Main Sequence partner Martin Duursma to commercialize the hydrogen-based power generation and storage technology developed at CSIRO. Ampol will serve as Endua’s industry partner.</p>
<p>Endua is backed by $5 million AUD (about $3.9 million USD) from Main Sequence, CSIRO and Ampol. The company plans to launch in Australia first before expanding into other countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sernia told TechCrunch that Endua was created to “solve one of the biggest problems facing the transition to renewable energy—how to store renewable energy in large quantities, for long periods of time.”</p>
<p>Endua’s modular power banks can run up to 150 kilowatts per pack and be extended for different use cases, serving as an alternative to power generators that run on diesel fuel. Batteries serve as backup, but Endua’s goal is to deliver renewable energy that can be stored in large quantities, enabling off-grid infrastructure and communities to have self-sustaining power sources.</p>
<p>“Hydrogen electrolysis technology has been around for quite some time but it still has a long way to go to meet the expectations of commercial markets and be cost-effective when compared to existing energy sources,” Sernia said. “The technology we’ve developed with CSIRO enables us to make the cost more affordable compared to fossil fuel sources, more reliable and easily maintained in remote communities.”</p>

<p>The startup plans to focus on industrial clients before reaching smaller businesses and residences. “One of the biggest opportunities, that few have really tackled, is that of diesel generator users like regional communities, mines or remote infrastructure,” Sernia said. “In farming, Endua’s solution could be used to power equipment such as a bore or irrigation pumps.” The power banks can plug into existing renewable energy systems, including solar and wind, to make the switch economical for users, he added. Water is part of the electrolysis process, but only a small amount is needed.</p>
<p>“Batteries are a great way to deliver dispatchable power in small increments and are a complementary part of the overall transition plan, but we’re focusing on delivering renewable energy that can be stored in large quantities, for large periods of time, so communities and remote infrastructure can access reliable, renewable energy at any time of day,” Sernia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ampol is working with Endua as part of its <a href="https://www.ampol.com.au/about-ampol/sustainability/future-energy">Future Energy and Decarbonisation Strategy</a>. It will test and commercialize Endua’s tech to reach its 80,000 B2B customers, focusing first on the off-grid diesel generator market, which the company said generates 200,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year.</p>
<p>In press statement, Ampol managing director and CEO Matthew Halliday said, “We are excited to be involved with Endua, which is part of our commitment to extending our customer value proposition by finding and developing new energy solutions that will assist with their energy transition.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More signs of the global market righting the ship after a disastrous 2020. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-07-1q21-smartphone-market-share">New figures from Gartne</a><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-07-1q21-smartphone-market-share">r</a> point to 26% increase in global sales year over year for the first quarter of 2021. The overall increase is an impressive one, though it comes after a couple of years of market slow down, followed by a step drop amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Manufacturers got hit from all sides last year. 2020 kicked things off with a manufacturing slowdown, as China and greater Asia were the first to be impacted by the effects of Covid-19. In the following months, global demand slowed, as shutdowns were instated and job loss and economic issues massively hampered sales.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2162041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="319" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg?resize=300,94 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg?resize=768,240 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg?resize=680,212 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-07-at-9.43.18-AM.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gartner</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new Gartner numbers maintain the same global top three manufacturers as this time last year. Samsung’s overall market share grew from 18.4- to 20.3%, courtesy of budget devices, returning to the number one spot.</p>
<p>Apple had managed to push its way to number one in Q4, on the strength of its belated 5G push. The company dropped down to number two for the first quarter – the same position it held this time last year. Overall, its market share is up around 2% y-o-y to 15.5, according to the figures. The top five are rounded out by three Chinese manufacturers &#8212; Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo – as Huawei’s struggles continue.</p>
<p>Thus far, global chip shortages appear to have had little impact on shipments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Astra, the space launch startup with plans to go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">public via a SPAC merger</a>, will acquire electric propulsion maker Apollo Fusion, the company said Monday. Electric propulsion systems are effective at moving spacecraft from lower to higher orbits, even to the moon, Astra Chief Engineer Benjamin Lyon said in a blog post Monday, pointing to Astra&#8217;s plans beyond missions to Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Astra will buy Apollo for $30 million in stock and $20 million in cash, for a total purchase price of $50 million. There is also the potential for an additional earn-out of up to $95 million if Apollo hits certain performance benchmarks. PJT Partners is acting as financial advisor to Astra with regard to the transaction, the Alameda-based launch startup said Monday.</p>
<p>Astra CEO Chris Kemp has been forthright about his goal of making the company a vertically integrated launch and space services provider, and Apollo’s thruster technology is a major piece of that puzzle. Astra <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">successfully launched</a> its first test rocket from Kodiak, Alaska last December, but in public statements Kemp has indicated plans for monthly commercial launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apollo produces two EP thruster systems, the Apollo Constellation Engine (ACE) and the ACE Max. Both are compatible with krypton or xenon propellants. The company said it had been selected by York Space Systems as the propulsion system provider for a LEO satellite constellation program that will be launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The transaction between Astra and Apollo will close after Astra’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Holicity is completed later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And we’re back. Well, not back-back. But we’re here in the San Jose McEnery Convention Center of the mind. The parking is awful and the hotels all got booked up five months ago, so we’re taking the CalTrain in from Redwood City (of the mind).</p>
<p>We’ve got a full house at this morning’s virtual kick off to Apple’s annual developer conference. And good thing, too. It’s shaping up to be a packed event. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">read more about that here</a>. You can also check out Apple’s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-live-stream-livestream-wwdc-event-keynote-2021-ios-ipados-15/">livestream here</a>. And, of course, we’ll be breaking out the biggest news into bite-sized chunks.</p>
<p>As always, the kickoff event is focused on Apple’s (numerous) operating systems: iOS/iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and, perhaps, a new homeOS. Often times that also comes with some new hardware. After all, you’ll need something to run those operating systems on.</p>
<p>Matthew will be leading the show, with help from various the TC team. Things kick off today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET.</strong></p>

Earlier this year, Tata Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tata-group-reaches-agreement-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bigbasket/">acquired majority stake in online grocery startup BigBasket</a>, and is reportedly in talks to acquire online pharmacy 1mg, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Prior to today&#8217;s announcement, CureFit had raised about $418 million and was last valued at $815 million, according to insight firm Tracxn. The startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/indias-top-fitness-and-wellbeing-startup-cure-fit-expands-to-the-u-s/">expanded to the U.S. market last year</a>, had about 1.5 million monthly active users in India last month, according to mobile insight firm App Annie &#8212; data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Joining Tata Digital marks an exciting new step for me and my team and is a recognition of the value we have created with CureFit for fitness enthusiasts in India,&#8221; said Bansal, who sold his previous venture Myntra to Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being part of Tata Digital will enable us to nationally scale up our offerings for our customers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspeed</a> has picked up two more companies in what is shaping up to be an acquisition spree for the Canadian point-of-sale software provider. The company today <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightspeed-to-acquire-ecwid-and-nuorder-to-unify-commerce-ecosystem-and-ignite-business-creation-301306660.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would acquire e-commerce platform Ecwid for $500 million; and NuOrder, a B2B ordering platform servicing wholesales, brands and retailers, for $425 million.</p>
<p>Together, the two deals underscore the long-anticipated consolidation trend swirling around the fragmented e-commerce industry, at a time when digital transactions are playing an ever more critical role in the Covid-impacted global economy, and smaller players are looking for better ways to compete against behemoths like Amazon and Stripe with a mix of tools and services addressing the various needs of merchants, brands, suppliers and everything in between.</p>
<p>&#8220;By joining forces with Ecwid and NuOrder, Lightspeed becomes the common thread uniting merchants, suppliers and consumers, a transformation we believe will enable innovative retailers to adapt to the new world of commerce,&#8221; said Dax Dasilva, founder and CEO of Lightspeed, in a statement. &#8220;As economies reopen and business creation accelerates, we hope to embolden entrepreneurs with the tools they need to simplify their operations and scale their ambitions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lightspeed will pay $175 million in cash and $325 million in shares for Ecwid; and it will pay $212.5 million in cash and $212.5 million in shares for NuOrder, the company said. Both deals are expected to close at the end of September, pending regulatory and other approvals.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is publicly traded and has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSPD?p=LSPD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of about $9.4 billion</a>. It has been on an acquisition march in the last several months, with the bigger picture being to build a complete, end-to-end, one-stop-shop for customers beyond the basics of the point-of-sale software that helped the company make its name. That has also included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/lightspeed-acquires-upserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Upserve in a $430 million deal in December</a> to deepen its presence in the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Ecwid itself has been around for years, initially making its name as a key partner of Facebook&#8217;s to help small businesses build commerce experiences on the social media platform, and eventually expanding to provide tools for merchants that use services like Square and Wix, as well as other third-party platforms like Instagram and Google &#8212; sometimes competing with but also potentially integrating with other e-commerce backends like Shopify.</p>
<p>The company &#8212; originally founded in Russia &#8212; had largely been under the venture radar until last year, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/ecwid-raises-42m-from-morgan-stanley-and-peakspan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $42 million</a> from Morgan Stanley and PeakSpan Capital, to double down on growth.</p>
<p>And that growth has been good. It currently has 130,000 paying customers across 100+ countries and Lightspeed said it had revenue of more than $20 million in the year that ended in March, with growth of 50% year-over-year. The deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions and post-closing working capital adjustment, is expected to close during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 after the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distinction between online and brick-and-mortar retail has disappeared. Lightspeed and Ecwid, two best-in-class platforms, will unite to truly empower businesses. By eliminating the barriers merchants face when selling online, we will only more rapidly achieve our common vision of democratizing retail for independent businesses worldwide and enrich the communities they serve,&#8221; said Ruslan Fazlyev, Ecwid CEO, in a statement.</p>
<p>NuOrder, meanwhile, will help Lightspeed deepen its role in supplier relationships and transactions &#8212; an essential cornerstone in how commerce works and one where Lightspeed had already been building a business, by way of its Lightspeed Supplier Network. NuOrder has 3,000 brand and 100,000 retailer customers &#8212; some of them include Canada Goose, Converse and Arc&#8217;teryx &#8212; and Lightspeed said that some $11.5 billion in orders were made through its platform in the year that ended in March.</p>
<p>Like Ecwid, NuOrder also posted revenues of $20 million in that period; its growth rate was 30% year-over-year.</p>
<p>&#8220;At NuORDER, we have been on a journey to revolutionize retail by building a global network for brands and retailers. The coming together of Lightspeed and NuORDER accelerates that vision exponentially. The power of connected commerce comes to life now,&#8221; said NuORDER co-founders and co-CEO&#8217;s Olivia Skuza and Heath Wells in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to join forces with Lightspeed to unlock transformative value for brands and retailers globally. This represents an inflection point in the history of retail.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big micromobility news of the week revolves around <strong>Spin</strong>, and it&#8217;s not about whether or not Ford is spinning out the company; they kept a pretty tight lip on that, but clearly big changes are happening. Co-founder Derrick Ko is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">stepping down as CEO</a> and moving into an advisory role, along with his other two co-founders Zaizhuang Cheng and Euwyn Poon. In Ko&#8217;s place is Ben Bear, who previously served as CBO of Spin.</p>
<p>Along with this news came a flurry of other announcements, but it makes sense to start with Spin&#8217;s latest public strategy for winning the e-scooter business. Spin is actively seeking out limited vendor permits with cities. In other words, the company doesn&#8217;t want to see its cities messing around with other operators. Spin is seeking exclusive partnerships and is prepared to better itself to get them. It&#8217;s positioning itself as the most desirable for cities as it shares even more news&#8230;</p>
<p>If Spin wants to have a kind of deal that Lyft-owned CitiBike has with NYC, then it needs to bring more to the table. It&#8217;s starting with e-bikes. 5,000 of them, to be specific, in the coming months, starting with Providence, RI in June and spreading outward into a few other mid-tier cities over the summer.</p>
<p>Spin is also flexing its tech that will help make its scooters safe and reliable &#8212; just what a city wants in a long-term commitment. This week, it brought its Drover AI-equipped scooters to Milwaukee (with plans to launch in Miami, Seattle and Santa Monica, as well) that are equipped to detect sidewalk and bike lane riding and validate parking. Seattle, Santa Monica and Boise, Idaho will soon be graced by Spin&#8217;s new S-200, a three-wheeled adaptive scooter built with Tortoise&#8217;s repositioning software that allows a remote operator to move scooters out of gutters or into more dense urban areas.</p>
<h3>Tier gets some more money</h3>
<p>Berlin-based <strong>Tier Mobility</strong>, which recently won a London permit, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/">raised $60 million</a> so it can expand its fleet of vehicles and battery charging networks. Technically, it&#8217;s a loan. The asset-backed financing comes from Goldman Sachs.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s talk about bikes</h3>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> has got a new e-bike piloting this month, starting in San Francisco, then Chicago and New York. It&#8217;ll be dropping the sleek, white bikes with soft purple LEDs at random around the city for people to test out. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/taking-lyfts-new-e-bike-for-a-spin/">Brian Heater gave it a spin</a>, and his general consensus was, <em>Yeah, it&#8217;s a good bike. Can&#8217;t complain.</em></p>
<p>While Lyft may have anti-theft protection on its e-bikes, the rest of us are not so lucky. According to market research company NPD Group, we saw a 63% YOY growth for bike sales in June. <a href="https://bikeindex.org/">Bike Index</a>, a national bike registry group, tells us that the number of bikes stolen has seen similar increases. The number of bikes reported stolen to the service was a little over 10,000 between April and September, compared to nearly 6,000 during the same period in the previous year. That&#8217;s an uptick of nearly 68%. So, when are apartment complexes going to be forced to build bike storage rather than car parks?</p>
<h3>Best cities for biking</h3>
<p>If you are going to risk theft and bike around, you&#8217;ll want to do it in one of the cities <a href="https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/ratings">PeopleForBikes</a> just announced are the best for biking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Topping this year&#8217;s ratings in the United States are Brooklyn, NY; Berkeley, CA and Provincetown, MA (each ranking first in the large, medium and small U.S. city categories, respectively). Top international performers include Canberra and Alice Springs in Australia; Utrecht and Groningen in the Netherlands and Gatineau, Longueuil and Montreal in Canada, all located in the province of Quebec.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biking is not all about fun and commuting. For some of us, it&#8217;s work. <strong>URB-E</strong>, the compact container delivery network that wants to replace trucks with small electric bikes, has announced PackItFresh as its final-mile refrigeration provider. PackItFresh&#8217;s totes can keep food at safe temperatures for up to 24 hours, yet another reason supermarkets need to be nixing the delivery trucks in favor of these more sustainable alternatives.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hesitate to put this one under deal of the week, because, well, the deal ain&#8217;t done. But it is interesting, and this is my show, so here we are. I&#8217;m talking about Aurora, the autonomous vehicle company, and a potential merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tl;dr for those who didn&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">catch my Friday story</a>. Several sources within the financial sector told me that Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. It appears the valuation is going to be somewhere in the $12 billion neighborhood. The deal is expected to be announced as early as next week. I should add that both Aurora and Reinivent declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with home insurance startup Hippo.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the deal could fall apart? Sure. But my sources tell me that it has progressed far enough that it would take a significant issue to derail the agreement. One more note: there is the tricky issue of Hoffman and Reinvent&#8217;s existing relationship with Aurora. Hoffman is a board member of Aurora and Reinvent is an investor. While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. Connie Loizos&#8217;s accompanying article digs into the increasing cases of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/">conflicts of interest</a> popping up in SPAC deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getir</strong>, the Istanbul-based grocery delivery app, raised $550m in new funding. This latest injection of capital, which tripled its valuation to $7.5 billion, came just three months after its last financing, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7">Financial Times reported</a>. The company, which just started to expand outside of Turkey in early 2021, is now planning a U.S. launch this year.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technology</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup building three-wheeled electric vehicles for autonomous delivery <em>or</em> human driven jaunts around town, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/">raised $4.3 million in seed funding</a> led by Trucks VC and Fifty Years.</p>
<p><strong>Flink</strong>, a Berlin-based on-demand &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery service built around self-operated dark stores and a smaller assortment (2,400 items) that it says it will deliver in 10 minutes or less, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">raised $240 million</a> to expand its business into more cities, and more countries.</p>
<p><strong>FlixMobility</strong>, the parent company of the FlixBus coach network and the FlixTrain rail service, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/">closed more than $650 million</a> in a Series G round of funding that values the Munich-based company at over $3 billion. Jochen Engert, who co-founded and co-leads the company with André Schwämmlein, described the round in a press call that TechCrunch participated in as a &#8220;balanced&#8221; mix of equity and debt, and said that the plan will be to use the funds to both expand its network in the U.S. market as well as across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Locus</strong>, a startup that uses AI to help businesses map out their logistics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/locus-raises-50-million-for-its-logistics-management-business/">raised $50 million</a> in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence. The new round, a Series C, was led by Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Qualcomm Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global Management and Falcon Edge also participated in the round, which brings the startup&#8217;s to-date raise to $79 million. The new round valued the startup, which was founded in India, at about $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Robotics</strong> announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/">$31.4 million round</a>. The funding is part of the $11.7 million Series A the company announced all the way back in late 2019. Investors include HAHN Automation, SAIC Capital Management, Soundproof Ventures , Heroic Ventures, SPARX Asset Management, Omron Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Scrum Ventures and Duke Angels.</p>
<p><strong>Roadster</strong>, the Palo Alto-based digital platform that gives dealers tools to sell new and used vehicles online has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/cdk-global-buys-vehicle-the-e-commerce-platform-roadster-for-360-million/">acquired for $360 million</a> by retail automotive technology company CDK Global Inc. As part of the all-cash deal, Roadster is now a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>
<p><strong>Sennder</strong>, a digital freight forwarder that focuses on moving cargo around Europe (and specifically focusing on trucks and &#8220;full truck load&#8221;, FTL, freight forwarding), has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised $80 million in funding</a>, at a valuation the company confirms is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota AI Ventures</strong>, Toyota&#8217;s standalone venture capital fund, dropped the &#8220;AI&#8221; and has been reborn as, simply, Toyota Ventures. The firm is commemorating its new identity with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/rebranded-toyota-ventures-invests-300-million-in-emerging-tech-and-carbon-neutrality/">new $300 million fund</a> that will focus on emerging technologies and carbon neutrality. The capital is split into two early-stage funds: the Toyota Ventures Frontier Fund and the Toyota Ventures Climate Fund.

<p>Waymo has been on my mind lately — and not because of the executive departures that I wrote about last month. No, I&#8217;ve been thinking about Waymo and how, or <em>if</em>, it&#8217;s been scaling up its Waymo One driverless ride-hailing service, which operates in several Phoenix suburbs. The latest example is that Waymo One can now be accessed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/waymos-driverless-taxi-service-can-now-be-accessed-on-google-maps/">booked through Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>But what about ridership? The folks at Sensor Tower, the mobile app market intelligence firm, recently shared some numbers that give the tiniest of glimpses into who is at least interested in trying the service.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. Waymo started an early rider program in April 2017, which allowed vetted members of the public, all of whom signed NDAs, to hail an autonomous Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan. All of these Waymo-branded vans had human safety operators behind the wheel.</p>
<p>In December 2018, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/">Waymo One</a>, the self-driving car service and accompanying app. Waymo-trained test drivers were still behind the wheel when the ride-hailing service began. Early rider program members were the first to be invited to the service. As these folks were shifted over to the Waymo One service, the NDA was lifted.</p>
<p>The first meaningful signs that Waymo was ready to put people in vehicles without human safety operators popped up in fall 2019. TechCrunch contributor Ed Niedermeyer was among the first (media) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo/">hail a driverless ride</a>. These driverless rides were limited and free. And importantly, still fell under the early rider program, which had that extra NDA protection. Waymo slowly scaled until about 5 to 10% of its total rides in 2020 were fully driverless for its exclusive group of early riders under NDA. Then COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company announced that members of Waymo One — remember this is the sans NDA service — would be able to take family and friends along on their fully driverless rides in the Phoenix area. Existing Waymo One members were given first access to the driverless rides. The company started to welcome more people directly into the service through its app, which is available on Google Play and the App Store.</p>
<p>Waymo said that 100% of its rides would be fully driverless, which it has maintained. Today, anyone can download the app and hail a driverless ride.</p>
<p>OK, back to the numbers. Sensor Tower shared monthly estimates for Waymo&#8217;s installs from the U.S. App Store and Google Play. The company said that most of the installs are on iOS, as it looks like the Waymo app only became available on Android in April 2021. This isn&#8217;t a ridership number. It does show how interest has grown, and picked up since February 2021.</p>

<p>Hi folks, welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>Another infrastructure bill was proposed in Washington this week. The <strong>House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure</strong> introduced a new bill that would invest $547 billion over the next five years on surface transport. While much of those funds would go toward improving America&#8217;s roads, bridges, and passenger rail, the INVEST in America Act would dedicate around $4 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and around $4 billion to invest in zero-emission transit vehicles.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that&#8217;s in addition to major infrastructure bills already proposed by President Joe Biden and House Democrats. It&#8217;s likely that this bill, should it pass, would be significantly scaled back &#8212; just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/the-station-rivian-rolls-towards-an-ipo-and-quantumscape-makes-a-big-battery-hire/">Congressional Republicans</a> are attempting to do with Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plan. You can read more about the bill <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/">here</a>.</p>
<p>President Biden has set his sights on battery manufacturing as a way to recover and reuse critical minerals in the EV supply chain. This is after it was reported that he walked back earlier signals that he might support domestic mining for these minerals, like lithium. Instead, it looks like his plan is to push for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-bidens-electric-vehicle-plan-includes-battery-recycling-push-2021-06-04/">continued importing of the metals</a> from foreign countries and then to recycle and reuse them at the end of a battery&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>This news is a blow to America&#8217;s mining industry but sure to be a boost for metal recyclers, like Redwood Materials in Nevada and Canadian company Li-Cycle, which is expanding its operations in the States.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest pushback against mining has come from environmental and conservation groups. A good example is the situation currently unfolding out in Nevada, where a proposed lithium mine may be halted due to the presence of a rare wildflower. Conservation groups want to get protected status for the flower. If they succeed? No more mine.</p>
<p>The final piece of news this week is a recent survey from <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> which found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/">51% of Americans</a> oppose phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. The report also found that those reported hearing &#8220;a lot&#8221; about EVs were more likely to seriously consider one for their next vehicle purchase. Also, while Americans are roughly in agreement that EVs are better for the environment, they&#8217;re equally in agreement that they&#8217;re more costly.</p>
<p>The upshot is that more and more Americans are coming around to the idea of EVs and the question of their benefits (on the environment, for example) is pretty well understood. But policymakers and OEMs clearly still have a ways to go in convincing a huge swathe of Americans to get on board.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be providing the looooonnnnggggg roundup of news this week, but here are a few little bits including some hires and other tidbits.</p>
<p><strong>7-Eleven</strong> said it plans to install <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/7-eleven-to-install-500-ev-charging-stations-by-the-end-of-2022/">500 direct-current fast charging ports</a> at 250 locations across North America by the end of 2022. These charging ports will be owned and operated by 7-Eleven, as opposed to fuel at its filling stations, which must be purchased from suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>Baraja</strong>, the lidar startup, appointed former Magna and DaimlerChrysler veterans to its executive team, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauleichenberg/">Paul Eichenberg</a> as chief strategy officer and Jim Kane as vp of automotive engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Heater</strong>, hardware editor here at TechCrunch, covered a recent gathering of ride-hailing drivers in Long Island City, Queens. The group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/rideshare-drivers-gather-in-nyc-in-hopes-of-unionizing/">protested outside of Uber&#8217;s offices</a> ahead of a proposed state bill. The drivers support the proposed bill that would make it easy for gig economy workers in the state to unionize.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">secured a permit</a> that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The permit, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important &#8212; and Cruise is the first to land this particular one &#8212; but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.</p>
<p><strong>DeepMap</strong> has developed a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deepmap-announces-roadmemory-a-highly-scalable-and-economical-mapping-service-enabling-hands-off-driving-everywhere-301304788.html">crowdsourced mapping service</a> called RoadMemory that lets automakers turn data collected from their own fleets of passenger vehicles and trucks into maps. The company says the tool is designed to expand geographic coverage more quickly and support hands-off autonomous driving features everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> is partnering with REEF Technology, one of the country&#8217;s largest parking garage operators, and a real estate acquisition company Neighborhood Property Group to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/joby-aviation-targets-parking-garages-for-its-aerial-ridesharing-network/">build out its network of vertiports</a>, with an initial focus on Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p><strong>Populus</strong>, the platform that helps cities manage shared mobility services, streets and curbs, launched a new <a href="https://www.populus.ai/latest-news/populus-expands-data-sharing-solutions-for-carsharing-in-oakland">digital car-sharing parking feature</a> in Oakland. The gist is that this feature helps cities collect data on car-sharing and deploy curbside paying payments. The company launched this particular product in 2018 and has been expanding to different cities.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, the autonomous sidewalk delivery startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/former-head-of-alphabets-loon-joins-starship-technologies-as-new-ceo/">hired a new CEO</a>. The company tapped Alastair Westgarth, the former CEO of Alphabet&#8217;s Loon, to lead the company as it looks to expand its robotics delivery service. Loon, Alphabet&#8217;s experiment to deliver broadband via high-altitude balloons, was shut down for good at the beginning of this year. Prior to working at Loon, Westgarth headed the wireless antennae company Quintel Solutions, was a vice president at telecommunications company Nortel and director of engineering at Bell Mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri Suzuki</strong>, a partner at design consultancy firm Pentagram, recently conducted a research project into the crucial role electric car sound has on a user&#8217;s safety, enjoyability, communication and brand recognition, out of which he developed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/pentagram-cuts-through-the-noise-of-ev-sound-design/">range of car sounds</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people in emerging markets depend on informal public transport to move across cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while there are ride-hailing and bus-hailing applications in some of these cities, there&#8217;s a dire need for journey-planning apps to improve mobility for users and reduce the time they spend commuting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African-founded startup <a href="https://www.whereismytransport.com/">WhereIsMyTransport</a> is one such company filling that gap for now. Today, i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t is announcing a $14.5 million Series A extension to continue its expansion across emerging markets; the company already has a presence in South Africa and Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naspers, via its investment arm, Naspers Foundry, co-led the investment with Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Naspers, the size of its check was $3 million. Japan&#8217;s SBI Investment also participated in the round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension round is coming a year after WhereIsMyTransport <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/28/google-toyota-invest-in-whereismytransport-to-map-transport-in-emerging-cities/">received a $7.5 million Series A investment</a> from VC firms and strategic investment from Google, Nedbank, and Toyota Tsusho Corporation (TTC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devin de Vries, Chris King and Dave New started the company in 2015. As a mobility startup, WhereIsMyTransport maps formal and informal public transport networks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company then uses data gotten to improve the public transport experience, making commute safe and accessible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this, WhereIsMyTransport licenses some of this data to governments, DFIs, NGOs, operators, and third-party developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research, analytics, insights and consumer and enterprise solutions purposes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority world,&#8221; said CEO Devin de Vries in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when we covered the company, it had mapped 34 cities in Africa while actively mapping some in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since then, it expanded into Mexico City last November and has completed multiple data production projects in the city alongside Lima, Bangkok, Gauteng, Dhaka</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Right now, the company has worked in 41 cities across 28 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhereIsMyTransport also launched its first consumer product Rumbo which provides network information from all modes of public transport in Mexico with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 100,000 users delivering over 750,000 real-time network alerts. The company says there are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to launch Rumbo in Lima, Peru, later this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For co-lead investor Naspers Foundry, this is the firm&#8217;s first investment in mobility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has funded four other South African startups &#8212; Aerobotics, SweepSouth, Aerobotics, and Studio Cap &#8212; with a focus on edtech, food and cleaning sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t pass on the opportunity to back an extraordinary South African founder who has built his business here in Cape Town to a global market leader in mapping formal and informal transportation with a strong focus on emerging markets,&#8221; Head of Naspers Foundry Fabian Whate said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also adds that there is an overlap between mobility and the food and e-commerce businesses that seem to be Naspers main focus from a Naspers perspective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The global food and e-commerce businesses, often operating in emerging markets, are quite reliant on mobility solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there&#8217;s a great overlap between what the Naspers Group does and the vision for WhereIsMyTransport</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, WhereIsMyTransport’s clients include Johannesburg commuter rail system Gautrain and Transport for Cape Town</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its international client base Google, the World Bank and WSP, and others.</span></p>
<p>South Africa CEO of Naspers, Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa, said:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Mobility remains an obstacle for billions of people in high-growth markets across the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our investment in WhereIsMyTransport is a testimony of our belief that great innovation and tech talent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in South Africa, and with the right backing and support, these businesses can provide solutions to local challenges that can improve the lives of ordinary people in South Africa and abroad</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">France&#8217;s competition watchdog, <em>L’Autorité de la concurrence</em>, has fined Google up to €220 million (~$268M) in a case related to self-preferencing within the adtech market which the watchdog found constituted an abuse by Google of a dominant position for ad servers for website publishers and mobile apps.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>began looking into Google&#8217;s adtech business following complaints from a number of French publishers.</p>
<p>Today it <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">said</a> Google had requested a settlement &#8212; and is &#8220;not disputing the facts of the case&#8221; &#8212; with the tech giant proposing certain &#8216;interoperability&#8217; commitments that the regulator has accepted, and which will form a binding part of <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/decision/relative-des-pratiques-mises-en-oeuvre-dans-le-secteur-de-la-publicite-sur-internet-0">the decision</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The watchdog called the action a world first in probing Google&#8217;s complex algorithmic ad auctions.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, <em>L&#8217;Autorité&#8217;</em>s president<em>,</em> Isabelle de Silva, said: &#8220;The decision sanctioning Google has a very special meaning because it is the first decision in the world to look into complex algorithmic processes. Auctions through which online display advertising works. The investigation, carried out particularly quickly, revealed the processes by which Google, relying on its considerable dominant position on ad servers for sites and applications, was favored over its competitors on both ad servers and SSP platforms. These very serious practices penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position. This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to restore a level playing field for all players, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising space. &#8221;</p>
<p>At specific issue is preferential treatment Google granted to its own proprietary technologies &#8212; offered under the Google Ad Manager brand &#8212; on both the demand and supply sides; via the operation of its DFP [DoubleClick For Publishers] ad server (which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their spaces advertising), and its sales platform SSP AdX (which organizes the auction process allowing publishers to sell their &#8216;impressions&#8217; or advertising inventories to advertisers), per the watchdog.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">found</a> that Google&#8217;s preferential treatment of its adtech harmed competitors and publishers.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokeswoman referred us to this <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/some-changes-our-ad-technology/">blog post</a> discussing the settlement where Maria Gomri, a legal director for Google France, writes that it has &#8220;agreed on a set of commitments to make it easier for publishers to make use of data and use our tools with other ad technologies&#8221; &#8212; before detailing the steps it has pledged to take.</p>
<p>The publishing groups that made the original complaint against Google in France were News Corp Inc., the Le Figaro group and the Rossel La Voix group, although Le Figaro withdrew its referral last November &#8212; at the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-google-copyrights-idINKBN27Z27B">same time as it signed a content-licensing deal with Google</a>, related to Google&#8217;s News Showcase product (a vehicle Google has spun up as legislators in different markets around the world have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">taken steps to force it to pay</a> for some content reuse).</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">earlier</a> ordered Google to negotiate with publishers over remuneration for reuse of their content, following the transposing into national law of updated, pan-EU copyright rules &#8212; which extend neighbouring rights to publishers&#8217; news snippets. So the adtech giant&#8217;s operations remain under scrutiny <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">on that front too</a>.</p>
<h2>Google agrees to interoperability changes</h2>
<p>Google has agreed to improve the interoperability of Google Ad Manager services with third-party ad server and advertising space sales platform solutions, per <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>, as well as agreeing to end provisions that favor itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The practices in question are particularly serious because they penalized Google&#8217;s competitors in the SSP market and the publishers of sites and mobile applications,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/article/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros-pour-avoir">press release</a> (translated from French with Google Translate). &#8220;Among these, the press groups &#8212; including those who were [the source] of the referral to the Authority &#8212; were affected even though their economic model is also strongly weakened by the decline in sales of paper subscriptions and the decline in associated advertising revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> confirmed it has accepted Google&#8217;s commitments &#8212; and makes them binding in its decision. The commitments will be mandatory for a three year period, <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/fr/communiques-de-presse/lautorite-de-la-concurrence-sanctionne-google-hauteur-de-220-millions-deuros">per the agreement</a>.</p>
<p>The commitments Google has offered appear to speak to some operational details that have emerged via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Texas antitrust lawsuit also targeting Google&#8217;s adtech</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, documents surfaced via that suit which appeared to show the tech giant operated a secret program that used data from past bids in its digital ad exchange to allegedly give its own ad-buying system an advantage over competitors, per the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-secret-project-bernanke-revealed-in-texas-antitrust-case-11618097760">WSJ</a> &#8212; which reported that the so-called &#8216;Project Bernanke&#8217; program was not disclosed to publishers who sold ads through Google&#8217;s exchange.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Texas leads ten states in lawsuit over Google&#8217;s ad business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/embed/#?secret=nYdrwaXCyV" data-secret="nYdrwaXCyV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the area of data access, Google has committed to the <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>to devise a solution to ensure that all buyers which use Google Ad Manager to participate in its ad exchange receive equal access to data from its auctions &#8212; &#8220;to help them efficiently buy ad space from publishers&#8221;. Including when publishers use an off-platform technique called &#8216;Header Bidding&#8217; (which enables publishers to run an auction among multiple ad exchanges but which, as a result of how Google operates, has meant such buyers may be at a data disadvantage vs those participating through Google&#8217;s own platform).</p>
<p>Google claims it is &#8220;usually not technically possible&#8221; for it to identify participants in Header Bidding auctions, and thus that it cannot share data with those buyers. But it&#8217;s now committed to address that by working &#8220;to create a solution that ensures that all buyers that a publisher works with, including those who participate in Header Bidding, can receive equal access to data related to outcomes from the Ad Manager auction&#8221;.</p>
<p>It notes that &#8220;in particular&#8221; it will be &#8220;providing information around the &#8216;minimum bid to win&#8217; from previous auctions&#8221;, going forward &#8212; which would address one disadvantageous blind-spot for publishers taking an off-platform route to try to earn more ad revenue.</p>
<p>Another commitment from Google to the French watchdog is a pledge to increase flexibility for publishers using its Ad Manager product &#8212; including by letting them set custom pricing rules for ads that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2541069/block-sensitive-categories?hl=en&quot;}">sensitive categories</a> and implementing product changes aimed at improving interoperability between Ad Manager and third-party ad servers.</p>
<p>Google also writes that it is &#8220;reaffirming&#8221; that it won&#8217;t limit Ad Manager publishers from negotiating specific terms or pricing directly with other sell-side platforms (SSPs); and says it is committing to continue to provide publishers with controls to include or exclude certain buyers at their discretion when they use its product.</p>
<p>The third batch of commitments focus on transparency &#8212; and the opacity of adtech has long been a core criticism of the market, including for the competitive dimension as unclear workings by dominant platforms can be used to shield abusive practices from view. (Indeed, <em>L&#8217;Autorité</em> already fined Google $166M back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/france-slaps-google-with-166m-antitrust-fine-for-opaque-and-inconsistent-ad-rules/">December 2019</a> for having what it billed then as “opaque and difficult to understand” rules for its ad platform, Google Ads, and for applying them in “an unfair and random manner.”)</p>
<p>On transparency, Google has pledged not to use data from other SSPs to optimize bids in its own exchange in a way that other SSPs can’t reproduce. It also says it&#8217;s reupping a promise not to share any bid from any Ad Manager auction participants with any other auction participant prior to completion of the auction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, we’ll give publishers at least three months&#8217; notice for major changes requiring significant implementation effort that publishers must adopt, unless those are related to security or privacy protections, or are required by law,&#8221; it further notes.</p>
<p>The commitments made to <em>L&#8217;Autorité </em>will apply to how Google operates its adtech in the French market &#8212; but are also set to be applied more widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally,&#8221; Gomri added in the blog post.</p>
<p><em>L&#8217;Autorité</em>&#8216;s action comes after years of attention paid to the online advertising market.</p>
<p>Back in 2018 it published a <a href="https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/sites/default/files/integral_texts/2019-10/avis18a03_en_.pdf">report</a> that delved into a number of competitive advantages leveraged by Facebook and Google, noting how the duopoly&#8217;s ad targeting offerings benefit from their leadership positions in respective markers and the resultant network effects; and also from their vertical integration model (playing in both publishing and technical intermediation); as well as from the &#8216;logged&#8217; environments both have developed, requiring users to log in to access &#8216;free&#8217; services &#8212; giving them access to a high volume of sociodemographic and behavioral data to power their ad targeting products, among other competitive advantages.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has also conducted an online ad market study <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">in recent years</a> &#8212; findings from which are underpinning &#8216;pro-competition&#8217; regulatory reform that&#8217;s now being targeted at tech giants with &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; which will, in the future, be subject to an ex ante regime of custom requirements aimed at preemptively preventing market abuse.</p>
<p>The European Commission has, meanwhile, issued multiple antitrust enforcements against Google&#8217;s business in recent years &#8212; including a $1.7BN fine related to its search ad brokering business, AdSense,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/google-fined-1-49bn-in-europe-for-antitrust-violations-in-search-ad-brokering/"> in 2019</a>, and a $2.7BN penalty for its price comparison service, Google Shopping, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/google-fined-e2-42bn-for-eu-antitrust-violations-over-shopping-searches/">2017</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>More recently, the EU regulators have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-antitrust-eu-idUSKBN29P23U">reported</a> to be further probing Google&#8217;s adtech practices. So more interventions could be forthcoming.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s preferred approach of not imposing specific remedies itself &#8212; nor obtaining specific commitments, beyond a general requirement not to continue the sanctioned abuse (or any equivalent behavior) &#8212; seems to have failed to move the needle, certainly where Google&#8217;s market dominance is concerned.</p>
<p>Still, EU lawmakers&#8217; experience with Google antitrust cases has certainly informed a recent pan-EU plan for a set of ex ante rules to apply to digital &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; &#8212; incoming under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Markets Act</a>, which was presented by Brussels last December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014 Alexis Patjane was at a local hookah bar in Mexico City with some friends and the bar ran out of tobacco. They thought maybe they could buy some online and have it delivered to the bar in real-time, but it turns out that service didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Patjane was running a food truck-making business, which was responsible for about 80% of all the food trucks in Mexico, so he had experience doing business in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of weeks later, to solve the instant delivery problem he had faced at the hookah bar, Patjane launched 99 minutos, a website that sold products and delivered them within 99 minutes, hence the name.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 99 minutos announced a $40 million Series B from Prosus and Kaszek Ventures which it plans to use to grow its business in Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently operates within 40 major markets across Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru and offers four services: less than 99 minutes delivery, same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and CO2-free delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What started as an e-commerce company with fast delivery quickly became a last-mile delivery service for other e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started to build the API connections and plug-ins, and any e-commerce could add our delivery service to their business,” Patjane told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">99 minutos makes money by charging the customer a flat fee for delivery and then offering the driver a flat rate as well, but today, the volume is so large on each route, that it’s become very lucrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ship about 60-80 packages per route,” Patjane said, and from the consumer’s perspective, the delivery app works similarly to Waze. “You can pause the delivery, you can change the address. You can say, “Oh, I’m not at home, I’m at the Starbucks on the corner, can you drop it off there?”’ he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patjane said that initially, the company offered delivery only within Mexico City, but it quickly grew to offer its services between cities and now operates between 21 cities in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-commerce is growing quickly in Latin America, but it is still [the] early days. E-commerce penetration in Latin America is at 6%, while China is reaching 30% and the U.S. is at 20%,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we hear big e-commerce players saying that 99 minutos is ‘their most reliable partner’ and that they are ‘the provider with the most potential,’ it tells us that the team is executing extremely well and is on a path to disrupt e-commerce delivery in Latin America,” said Banafsheh Fathieh, Head of Americas Investments at Prosus Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the funds will also be to speed up their city-to-city deliveries. “We’ll be doing same day [delivery] from city to city and will be using small aircraft to connect the cities,” Patjane said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos is going to be one of the passengers on his spaceflight company Blue Origin&#8217;s first ever human space launch on July 20. The Amazon founder announced the news via his Instagram on Monday morning, revealing that his brother Mark will also be coming along for the ride. Bezos and his brother will join the winner of an online auction Blue Origin is currently hosting, which currently stands at $2.8 million as the highest bid for that seat.</p>
<p>The Blue Origin launch of its suborbital, reusable New Shepard rocket on July 20 will be the first time it has ever flown with people on board. It&#8217;s unusual for a company to make its first ever human spaceflight a mission with a paying passenger, and now we know that it&#8217;s also going to be carrying one of the world&#8217;s richest people, another bold choice for a first human flight. Virgin Galactic, by contrast, has flown to space multiple times with test pilots and astronauts before its forthcoming trip with Sir Richard Branson. Elon Musk has also never flown on a SpaceX launch, though he has suggested in the past that he will fly on one of his company&#8217;s vehicles at some point.</p>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard has flown plenty of times without people, however, and save for the first flight where the reusable booster was lost, has had a complete success for each of those 15 missions, including landing of the booster (except that first time) and recovery of the capsule (for all of the launches). The New Shepard rocket doesn&#8217;t go all the way to orbit, but instead flies to the edge of space, where passengers experience a few minutes of weightlessness and an unbeatable view of Earth through the capsules many windows, before returning to a parachute-assisted landing on the ground in Texas near Blue Origin&#8217;s launch site.</p>
<p>The auction for Blue Origin&#8217;s first paying customer seat currently sits at $2.8 million, and it&#8217;s been there for a while now after the price raised from $1.4 million when Blue Origin opened unsealed bidding on May 19. The final phase of the auction, set for June 12, will include live online bidding from remaining participants who bump their existing bid to match the high offer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of Google&#8217;s strong advantages in the world of online video has been the sheer size of YouTube: currently, the site has more than 2.3 billion monthly active users and over 500 hours of content uploaded every minute. Now, Google and YouTube are hoping to leverage some of that heft as it goes head to head with TikTok.</p>
<p>Shorts, YouTube&#8217;s TikTok rival for building 60-second videos set to music that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched first in India</a> and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded to the U.S.</a>, is now opening up in three more regions &#8212; the UK, Canada and Latin America. And alongside that, YouTube is turning on a new feature: users will now be able to dip into the wider YouTube catalogue when creating their videos.</p>
<p>The rollout to new countries is starting today and will be fully live by the end of June, a spokesperson tells me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The geographic and feature expansions underscore how Google continues to double down on the shorter video format to capture some of the audience that might otherwise go to TikTok &#8212; or, indeed, rival products from the likes of Instagram (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a>), Snapchat (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>) or others &#8212; for their quick-shot fix.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how well that is playing out in terms of engagement or creators just yet: YouTube tells me that the YouTube Shorts player &#8212; which appears as a bar on the YouTube app &#8212; now has passed 6.5 billion daily views in the countries where it is available.</p>
<p>YouTube is not disclosing creator numbers, nor is it disclosing active user numbers of Shorts itself. (But it has definitely built out a channel for incentivizing them: last month it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $100 million creators fund</a> to lure more people to build content in its new channel.)</p>
<p>The company declined to say whether it plans to launch a standalone Shorts app at any point, but it&#8217;s in the process of improving user experience for people through the YouTube app. You can now scroll vertically from one Short to the next, not unlike how you would on TikTok, and you can get to Shorts directly from a tab on the app.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2161955,2161956,2161957,2161958"]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shorts is still technically in beta, and so it&#8217;s to be expected that YouTube will be adding in a lot of new features in the coming months as it watches how it gets picked up, or what people decry is lacking.</p>
<p>YouTube tells me, for example, that the ability to sample licensed music had been getting slowly expanded and rolled out in India and the U.S. in the past few weeks. If you are able to access shorts UK and you get access to Shorts as of today, you will be able to use the audio feature, too.</p>
<p>That licensed music trove now numbers millions of songs, YouTube said, from <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">250 labels and publishers, including Universal Music Group’s labels and publishing companies, Sony Music Entertainment and Publishing, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Because Music, Merlin, Beggars, Ditto, AEI, The State51, Kobalt and more. (To be clear: this was the same number and list that it had last month, no new updates there.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to this, YouTube has added in other features since it launched. For example, it now lets creators add text, captions and graphics overlays on Shorts videos; sample audio from other Shorts; clips from your phone&#8217;s gallery; and filters for color correction &#8212; a template that will be expanded with more effects over time, YouTube said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But within that context, it will be interesting to see the impact of adding audio and video from across all of YouTube &#8212; we&#8217;re talking billions of videos here &#8212; will have on how Shorts gets used and how it evolves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This will mean not only music from creators, but all kinds of video segments that may have already gone viral, or may get their 15 minutes of fame as a result of one great Short.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Conversely, Shorts viewers and would-be creators will also be able to click through directly to the original content, and information about a creator, that was used in a Short &#8212; a key detail that should matter to those who have felt that originators of memes, dances, songs and other creator content sometimes get lost in the mix in a lot of what you see on viral video content platforms like TikTok&#8217;s (although it too has made it easier to find and link through, and credit original creators).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The network effect for a platform like YouTube is particularly compelling here, if the right audience takes YouTube up on what it is offering to them. At a time when TikTok remains a relatively new phenomenon, and there remains the question over how regulators will treat the Chinese-owned app longer term in countries like the U.S., there is a lot still to play for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash is the predominant method of sending and receiving payments in the Middle East. If you owe someone a cup of coffee or a trip over a long period, repaying via cash is your best bet. This is one problem out of many financial issues that haven&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been addressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that startups are springing up to provide solutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month Telda, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now two-month-old startup</a> in Egypt, raised an impressive sum as pre-seed to offer digital banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.ziina.com/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6yILv-ITxAhXwyYUKHcRnCncQFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i4nN5d3iZddlUw_WDJ-Ns">Ziina</a>, another startup based in Dubai, has closed $7.5 million in seed funding to scale its peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service across the Middle East and North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has managed to enlist top global investors and fintech founders in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Avenir Growth and Class 5 Global led this latest tranche of financing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wamda Capital, FJ Labs, Graph Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Jabbar Internet Group, Oman Technology Fund’s Jasoor Ventures, and ANIM also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders who took part include Checkout CEO Guillaume Pousaz via his investment fund Zinal Growth; Krishnan Menon, BukuKas CEO, as well as executives from Paypal and Venmo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This adds to a roster of executives and early employees from Revolut, Stripe, Brex, Notion, and Deel that joined Ziina’s round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, it has raised over $8.6 million since launching last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes the $850,000 pre-seed raised in May 2020 and $125,000 secured after going through Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter batch early this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Faisal Toukan, Sarah Toukan, and Andrew Gold. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the latest addition to the Middle East’s bubbling fintech ecosystem and is capitalising on the region&#8217;s rapid adoption of fintech friendly regulation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company allows users to send and receive payments with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a phone number —no IBAN or swift code required as is the de facto method in the UAE and some parts of the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting during a hackathon in the U.S., Faisal and Gold began exchanging ideas on how to build wallets, wanting to mirror the successes platforms like WePay, Paytm have had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, VCs seemed to be interested in how the wallets ecosystem intersected with banking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The lines between wallets and banking have become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blurred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wallet has a banking partner, and people who use wallets use them for their day-to-day needs,&#8221; CEO Faisal Toukan said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah, who is Faisal&#8217;s sister, was on her personal fintech journey in London. There, she attended several meetups headlined by the founders of Monzo and Revolut. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her knowledge and the experience of the other two, the founders decided that solving P2P payments issues was their own way of driving massive impact in the Middle East</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how far have they gone? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched a beta for the market that&#8217;s restricted for regulatory reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Toukan remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the process of getting regulated. We&#8217;ve got a banking partner, one of the three largest banks in the UAE, and we&#8217;ve set a new wallet to launch a month from now. That&#8217;s also what we were working throughout our period in YC. So it&#8217;s been quite an eventful year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech sector in MENA is growing fast; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> numbers, at a CAGR of 30%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in the UAE, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast">estimated</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19845/fintech-in-the-middle-east-2021-forecast"> that over 450 fintech companies will raise about $2 billion in 2022</a> compared to the $80 million raised in 2017</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fintechs in the region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on solving payments, transfers, and remittances. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside its P2P offering, these are the areas Ziina wants to play in, including investment and cryptocurrency services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Toukan, there&#8217;s no ease of making online investments, and remittances </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in exchange houses, a manual process where people need to visit an office physically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;So what we&#8217;re looking to do is to bring all these products to life in the UAE and expand beyond that. But the first pain point we&#8217;re solving for is for people to send and receive money with two clicks,&#8221; the CEO affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with P2P has its own advantages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, peer-to-peer services is a repeat behavioural mechanism that allows companies to establish trust with customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it&#8217;s a cheaper customer acquisition model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toukan says that as Zinna expands </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2022; and Egypt and Tunisia some years from now &#8212; as he wants the company&#8217;s wallet to become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamless across borders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want a situation where if you move into Saudi or Dubai, you&#8217;re able to use the same wallet versus using different banking applications,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be on the right side of regulation is key to any fintech expansion, and Toukan says Ziina has been in continuous dialogue with regulators to operate efficiently. But some challenges have stemmed from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding the right banking partners. &#8220;You need to make a case to the banks that this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mutually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beneficial partnership. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the way we&#8217;ve done that is by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting different cases globally like CashApp that worked with Southern Bank,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the company has moved past that challenge, it&#8217;s in full swing to launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ziina has thousands of users who transacted more than $120,000 on the platform this past month.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition, there are over 20,000 users on its waiting list to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be onboarded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziina has already built a team with experience across tech companies like Apple, Uber, Stanford, Coinbase, Careem, Oracle, and Yandex</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to double down on hiring with this new investment and customer acquisition and establishing commercial partnerships</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, Apple is holding a (virtual) keynote on the first day of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">developer conference</a>, and the company is expected to talk about a ton of software updates. At <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>, you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TD96VTf0Xs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As usual with Apple’s developer conferences, you can expect to learn more about the next major updates of the company’s operating systems. Get ready for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, a new version of macOS and some updates for watchOS and tvOS as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Apple could also use this opportunity to unveil some new products that are particularly popular with developers. Apple has already shipped several laptops and desktop computers with its own ARM-based M1 chip.</p>
<p>High-end models haven’t been updated yet. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">Rumor has it</a> that Apple could use today’s opportunity to unveil a new iMac Pro, updated MacBook Pro models or even a new external display.</p>
<p>You can watch the live stream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you don’t need to download a new app. You can open the Apple TV app and find the Apple Events section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you live stream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fug1fQw9_-4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>1971 is the name of the year and an Apple TV+ documentary series billed as The Year That Music Changed Everything. It&#8217;s also the number of hours the former President kept up his blog From the Desk Of. No, that&#8217;s not true. But it is satisfactual. The thesis of the movie 1971 is that music suddenly came into its own a year and a half past the Beatles&#8217; sell date. In fact, the filmmakers make a very good case for this, with lots of studio footage of Elton John, Isaac Hayes, Andy Warhol and the Loud family, and the Osmond Family. I know this sounds like I&#8217;m being sarcastic. I would have been more onboard if there had been a little less of Keith Richards zombied out in the south of France and a tad more of the incredible Tapestry sessions that made the earth move under our feet and the sky come tumbling down, but by the end of the year the music apparently survived, I bought the bit,</p>
<p>2021 could use a little of this treatment. On Gray&#8217;s Anatomy, which has been time delayed 8 or so months back to the height of the Pandemic, the season finale sped up the clock to sync up mostly with the present. This Is Us started in the present, then flashed forward 4 years to a point midway between now and a previous flash forward so far in the future that apparently household appliances and haircut styles seemed to have stalled out in innovations and new features. The hidden message: forget binge viewing and working from home; it&#8217;s all watercooler conversations and cliffhangers just to be clear. Welcome back, Kotter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re just weeks into the Vaccination Age and already we&#8217;re defaulting back to old norms far faster than the experts predict. Twitter is rolling out a $3 per month professional version for French and Canadian journalists that lets you save bookmarks and edit mistakes. Twitter Spaces has found a new tab in the mobile client to aid discovery of new live shows, and Facebook has invented Bulletin as a jump starter for neutered apolitical, private public radio oriented newsletters with embedded Clubhouse rules — evading the Apple 30% app store in-app tax by creating a %-to-be-named-later out-of-app subscription experience. No wonder the future is barely distinguishable from this Thursday. But don&#8217;t mistake my lack of outrage for anything but total support for the three major plans on the table so far. I actually think we&#8217;ll see the beginnings of some real shape-shifting out there in the creator economy, as we saw in an earlier time with Tom Wolf and Ken Kesey&#8217;s Electric Acid Kool Aid Test, and everything Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago we saw what happens when the talent takes over the institution. &#8217;72 the institution strikes back, &#8217;73 the tapes are played back, &#8217;74 even the president of the united states must stand naked. The underlying truth of the matter is that every year is the time when music takes over. The revolution continues to not be televised, this time shared with added interactivity. Joni Mitchell forever sits gunning the engine in her car waiting at the top of the hill:</p>
<blockquote><p>He makes friends easy<br />
He&#8217;s not like me<br />
I watch for judgement anxiously<br />
Now where in the city can that boy be</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fixing workplace misconduct reporting is a mission that&#8217;s snagged London-based <a href="https://vaultplatform.com">Vault Platform</a> backing from Google&#8217;s AI focused fund, Gradient Ventures, which is the lead investor in an $8.2 million Series A that&#8217;s being announced today.</p>
<p>Other investors joining the round are Illuminate Financial, along with existing investors including Kindred Capital and Angular Ventures. Its $4.2M seed round was closed back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/vault-platform/">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Vault sells a suite of SaaS tools to enterprise-sized or large/scale-up companies to support them to pro-actively manage internal ethics and integrity issues. As well as tools for staff to report issues, data and analytics is baked into the platform &#8212; so it can support with customers&#8217; wider audit and compliance requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Neta Meidav said that as well as being wholly on board with the overarching mission to upgrade legacy reporting tools like hotlines provided to staff to try to surface conduct-related workplace risks (be that bullying and harassment; racism and sexism; or bribery, corruption and fraud), as you might expect Gradient Ventures was interested in the potential for applying AI to further enhance Vault&#8217;s SaaS-based reporting tool.</p>
<p>A feature of its current platform, called &#8216;GoTogether&#8217;, consists of an escrow system that allows users to submit misconduct reports to the relevant internal bodies but only if they are not the first or only person to have made a report about the same person &#8212; the idea being that can help encourage staff (or outsiders, where open reporting is enabled) to report concerns they may otherwise hesitate to, for various reasons.</p>
<p>Vault now wants to expand the feature&#8217;s capabilities so it can be used to proactively surface problematic conduct that may not just relate to a particular individual but may even affect a whole team or division &#8212; by using natural language processing to help spot patterns and potential linkages in the kind of activity being reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our algorithms today match on an alleged perpetrator&#8217;s identity. However many events that people might report on are not related to a specific person &#8212; they can be more descriptive,&#8221; explains Meidav. &#8220;For example if you are experiencing some irregularities in accounting in your department, for example, and you&#8217;re suspecting that there is some sort of corruption or fraudulent activity happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the greatest [workplace misconduct] disasters and crises that happened in recent years &#8212; the Dieselgate story at Volkswagen, what happened in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion">Boeing</a> &#8212; the common denominator in all these cases is that there&#8217;s been some sort of a serious ethical breach or failure which was observed by several people within the organization in remote parts of the organization. And the dots weren&#8217;t connected,&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;So the capacity we&#8217;re currently building and increasing &#8212; building upon what we already have with GoTogether &#8212; is the ability to connect on these repeated events and be able to connect and understand and read the human input. And connect the dots when repeated events are happening &#8212; alerting companies&#8217; boards that there is a certain &#8216;hot pocket&#8217; that they need to go and investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would save companies from great risk, great cost, and essentially could prevent huge loss. Not only financial but reputational, sometimes it&#8217;s even loss to human lives&#8230; That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re getting to and what we&#8217;re aiming to achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is the question of how defensible Vault&#8217;s GoTogether feature is &#8212; how easily it could be copied &#8212; given you can&#8217;t patent an idea. So baking in AI smarts may be a way to layer added sophistication to try to maintain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some very sophisticated, unique technology there in the backend so we are continuing to invest in this side of our technology. And Gradient&#8217;s investment and the specific we&#8217;re receiving from Google now will only increase that element and that side of our business,&#8221; says Meidav when we ask about defensibility.</p>
<p><span class="il">Commenting on the funding in a statement,</span> Gradient Ventures founder and managing partner, Anna Patterson, added: “<span class="il">Vault</span> tackles an important space with an innovative and timely solution. <span class="il">Vault</span>’s application provides organizations with a data-driven approach to tackling challenges like occupational fraud, bribery or corruption incidents, safety failures and misconduct. Given their impressive team, technology, and customer traction, they are poised to improve the modern workplace.”</p>
<p>The London-based startup was only founded in 2018 &#8212; and while it&#8217;s most keen to talk about disrupting legacy hotline systems, which offer only a linear and passive conduit for misconduct reporting, there are a number of other startups playing in the same space. Examples include the likes of LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/allvoices-raises-3-million-to-build-a-platform-for-anonymous-harassment-and-bias-reporting/">AllVoices</a>, <a href="https://resources.whispli.com/blog/seed-round">YC-backed Whispli</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/hootsworth-helps-you-address-sexual-harassment-and-other-workplace-issues/">Hootsworth </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/spot-launches-chatbot-for-hr-departments-to-address-harassment-and-discrimination/">Spot</a> to name a few.</p>
<p>Competition seems likely to continue to increase as regulatory requirements around workplace reporting keep stepping up.</p>

<p>The incoming EU Whistleblower Protection Directive is one piece of regulation Vault expects will increase demand for smarter compliance solutions &#8212; aka &#8220;TrustTech&#8221;, as it seeks to badge it &#8212; as it will require companies of more than 250 employees to have a reporting solution in place by the end of December 2021, encouraging European businesses to cast around for tools to help shrink their misconduct-related risk.</p>
<p>She also suggests a platform solution can help bridge gaps between different internal teams that may need to be involved in addressing complaints, as well as helping to speed up internal investigations by offering the ability to chat anonymously with the original reporter.</p>
<p>Meidav also flags the rising attention US regulators are giving to workplace misconduct reporting &#8212; noting some recent massive awards by the SEC to external whistleblowers, such as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whistleblower-is-awarded-28-million-in-panasonic-avionics-case-11621443228">$28M</a> paid out to a single whistleblower earlier this year (in relation to the Panasonic Avionics consultant corruption case).</p>
<p>She also argues that growing numbers of companies going public (such as via the SPAC trend, where there will have been reduced regulatory scrutiny ahead of the &#8216;blank check&#8217; IPO) raises reporting requirements generally &#8212; meaning, again, more companies will need to have in place a system operated by a third party which allows anonymous and non-anonymous reporting. (And, well, we can only speculate whether companies going public by SPAC may be in greater need of misconduct reporting services vs companies that choose to take a more traditional and scrutinized route to market&#8230; )</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few years back I had to convince investors that this category it really is a category &#8212; and fast forward to 2021, congratulations! We have a market here. It&#8217;s a growing category and there is competition in this space,&#8221; says Meidav.</p>
<p>&#8220;What truly differentiates Vault is that we did not just focus on digitizing an old legacy process. We focused on leveraging technology to truly empower more misconduct to surface internally and for employees to speak up in ways that weren&#8217;t available for them before. GoTogether is truly unique as well as the things that we&#8217;re doing on the operational side for a company &#8212; such as collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gives an example of how a customer in the oil and gas sector configured the platform to make use of an anonymous chat feature in Vault&#8217;s app so they could provide employees with a secure direct-line to company leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve utilizing the anonymous chat that the app enables for people to have a direct line to leadership,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That&#8217;s incredible. That is such a progress, forward looking way to be utilizing this tool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meidav says Vault has around 30 customers at this stage, split between the US and EU &#8212; its core regions of focus.</p>
<p>And while its platform is geared towards enterprises, its early customer base includes a fair number of scale-ups &#8212; with familiar names like Lemonade, Airbnb, Kavak, G2 and OVO Energy on the list.</p>
<p>Scale ups may be natural customers for this sort of product given the huge pressures that can be brought to bear upon company culture as a startup switches to expanding headcount very rapidly, per Meidav.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the early adopters and they are also very much sensitive to events such as these kind of [workplace] scandals as it can impact them greatly&#8230; as well as the fact that when a company goes through a hyper growth &#8212; and usually you see hyper growth happening in tech companies more than in any other type of sector &#8212; hyper growth is at time when you really, as management, as leadership, it&#8217;s really important to safeguard your culture,&#8221; she suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it changes very, very quickly and these changes can lead to all sorts of things &#8212; and it&#8217;s really important that leadership is on top of it. So when a company goes through hyper growth it&#8217;s an excellent time for them to incorporate a tool such as Vault. As well as the fact that every company that even thinks of an IPO in the coming months or years will do very well to put a tool like Vault in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expanding Vault&#8217;s own team is also on the cards after this Series A close, as it guns for the next phase of growth for its own business. Presumably, though, it&#8217;s not short of a misconduct reporting solution.</p>
