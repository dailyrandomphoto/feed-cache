					<description><![CDATA["Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Nordic countries make up just 4% of Europe&#8217;s total population, but they account for a significant amount of venture capital investment.</p>
<p>That said, Norway&#8217;s VC community has been somewhat dormant for a while. The country makes far too much money from oil, giving it one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and a large system of socialized support. Not a bad thing, but as a result, there are few &#8220;hungry&#8221; tech entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>High-profile players like Northzone and Creandum did well with early entries into Spotify and Klarna, among others, and now Norway is catching up with the rest of the European hubs. Among the trends our survey respondents identified were e-commerce, blockchain and crypto, healthtech, energy, mobility and climate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investments highlighted included Fairown, Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite, Pexip, PortalOne, Dignio, Speiz, Plaace, Glint Solar, variable.co and Nomono. Local investors tend to invest 50% to 90% of their fund into local startups, “but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries,” said one.</p>

<p>On the horizon, there is hope for an increased focus on mental health and wellness from organizations, the press and the government; many also celebrated the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, bitcoin’s rise and a new occupant in the White House.</p>
<p>Green shoots of recovery are coming from portfolio revenue growth, exits and IPOs. One investors we spoke to said Norway is &#8220;becoming a major hub, with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Sean Percival, managing partner, Spring Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
E-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Fairown.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Martech.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Not just COVID-proof but services that thrive in COVID times.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
In Norway, sustainability-focused companies. Lots of good ideas but little revenue growth proven so far.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50% Norway, 50% Nordic/Baltic.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway does video tech well.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Strong B2B, weak B2C, lots of SDG focus.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
We are not so hard hit in Norway, so Oslo will likely not see much exodus. It’s still the best place to build a company in this country. Although personally I moved to a small village and don’t see myself moving back to Oslo.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
E-commerce is booming here post-COVID, where before it was rather weak.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our portfolio is heavy on SaaS, which has weathered things well. So for our founders, it’s mostly about keeping churn-and-burn rates low to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
In some cases yes, including our e-commerce SaaS companies and my recent Bitcoin exchange investment (MiraiEx).</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Bitcoin’s rise and new open banking solutions have shown the world’s financial engines are still pushing forward. Everything is being built with less friction these days. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know. Iterate is a cool company builder company flying under the radar. Just had their first big investment success/cash out with a company called Porterbuddy.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Norway is slowing, becoming a major hub with scale-ups and international capital incoming much faster these days (recent investments from SoftBank and Founders fund, for example).</p>
<h2>Espen Malmo, founding partner, Skyfall Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Skyfall focuses on software companies, marketplaces and hardware companies with a recurring software revenue bundle. We are really excited about the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Our team has been involved and invested in crypto since 2012, so we’ve been excited about the industry for a long time. We have invested in two great companies in the sector, the blockchain analytics tool Nansen.ai and the cryptocurrency exchange MiraiEx. We also love embedded commerce and social commerce, which we think will boost the more independent long tail of e-commerce in the years to come. Our portfolio company Outshifter is positioned well to utilize this trend.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It is always hard to pick favorites since we are excited about all our investments, but Nomono is one that really excites us. Nomono is a software and hardware solution to capture and intelligently process voice recordings and spatial audio. The solution enables podcasters to edit their recordings with the click of a button, as a sort of digital audio technician in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
This is super hard to pinpoint and it is really challenging to label an industry as overlooked. Bioinformatics is maybe a little bit overlooked in Norway, but I don’t feel that is the case globally. Also, I think the pure B2B SaaS focus of a lot of VC funds makes it harder than necessary to get funding for hardware companies and companies with a rundle business model, even though hardware revenues bundled with recurring software revenues can create extraordinary outcomes due to high order values and strong lock-in effects.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We invest in strong technical founders solving big problems in markets ripe for change. We usually prefer that the company has a prototype or beta of their solution and some initial market traction.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Both micromobility and telemedicine seem very crowded at this point, and we believe the current market leaders in these sectors will become the winners. I think it will be very hard to enter this space as a new startup at this moment in time.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We have a Nordic investment mandate, but we primarily focus on Norway as we are a Norwegian pre-seed/seed fund and have our competitive insight, network and brand here in Norway. So more than 50% in Norway, but we do look at deal flow in all Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Norway has a great track record within the video conferencing and audio industry. After Cisco bought Tandberg, a world-leading video conferencing company, for $3.3 billion in 2010, Video Valley (the area of Lysaker right outside of Oslo) has churned out a lot of successful companies within the space. For example, Acano (acquired by Cisco for $700 million), Pexip (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $1.4 billion) and Huddly (IPO&#8217;ed, now valued at $0.5 billion). From our own portfolio, both Nomono and Oivi are started by serial entrepreneurs with track records from successful Video Valley companies. Also, Norway is by far the leading country globally in adoption of electric vehicles per capita, and today over 50% of all new cars bought are electrical. This means that Norway is a great playing field for startups piggybacking on the EV revolution and also the green revolution in general. The EV home charger Easee is a company to watch.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Norway is a country where you get access to a highly educated and technically skilled workforce that is proficient in English, and the valuation of the companies is well below the levels you see in the U.S., or even in Sweden. I think Norway is a country to watch, but I obviously also believe that all the Nordic countries will continue to punch well above their “weight class” in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes, the acceptance of working remotely will democratize the startup ecosystem globally. We should see a relative decrease in growth in the traditional hubs of Silicon Valley/SF, Beijing, London, Berlin and so on, compared to a relative increase in companies formed and managed “in the cloud.” We already have one such company in our portfolio, Nansen.ai, which truly is distributed across the world, “in the cloud,” and has been so from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We do not invest in sectors that have been hit directly by the pandemic, so we have been lucky in that way.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
No, we have in many ways been affected positively by COVID-19 as we have major investments in companies that are working with remote work, home delivery, e-commerce, cryptocurrencies and so on. In general, technology looks like the winning category during this pandemic, and I believe that will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
As answered above, a lot of our companies are actually performing better than usual amid COVID.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The decline in infections locally and the rollout of the COVID vaccines. Also, Trump leaving the Oval Office. I don’t think I would have managed four more years with him in the spotlight, inciting hatred and nonsense on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
Yes, Johan Brand, co-founder of Kahoot and now an angel investor.</p>
<h2>Kjetil Holmefjord, partner, StartupLab</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Sector agnostic. Personally interested in climate.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Latest one announced: <a href="https://variable.co/">Variable</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Positive impact, fast team, big returns.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
100% Norway.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Video, health, climate.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Getting better every day.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Increase but maybe not a surge.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
More international competition for investment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Vaccine news.</p>
<h2>Anne Solhaug Tutar, partner, Antler</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We focus on technology companies and are industry agnostic in general, but in Oslo we have a particular focus on startups within the energy, property and mobility sector.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Speiz, Plaace and Glint Solar are a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Absolutely! We love any company that removes friction and focuses on solving real problems. Very often we see that the best companies are started by founders that have directly been impacted by an inefficiency or problem themselves, and later dedicate their lives to fixing it. Those founders will go above and beyond, and work relentlessly to understand their customers&#8217; needs. We will see a lot of new opportunities from decentralized finance and a shift to a truly global economy where borders and barriers will be surpassed with smart technology.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
The most important factor for any investment we make: a very strong co-founder team. Beyond that, a thoroughly validated business idea and model, a concept that has the potential to scale, traction; rapid growth week over week and founders solving a real problem and not a made-up problem.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We have a decade behind us of incremental innovations. In the next 10 to 20 years, we will see huge leaps and groundbreaking new technologies. Lots of current small improvement solutions will be replaced by technologies that are dramatically changing the way we live, work, collaborate and act.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We can invest anywhere, but the Oslo branch typically invests in locally established companies. I&#8217;d say 90%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Our focus in Norway says a lot about the industries we think have potential for disruption and where Norway holds a particularly strong position; energy, property and mobility.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Compared to other locations, we see that startups based out of Oslo are typically cheaper than in other parts of the world. Investors that are able to identify the right founders can make great investments in Norway. At the same time, Norwegian founders would benefit from more investors with an international focus. The ecosystem of investors and accelerators is rapidly growing in Oslo, and with more and more successful local startups we have a great environment set up for breeding more great companies going forward. We&#8217;re very bullish on what will come out of Oslo over the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Generally we experience two simultaneous trends: More talent being freed up from their previous engagements and more uncertainty, with founders being more on the fence about making the leap. We haven&#8217;t made observations of this being connected to specific cities or areas yet.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s wise to develop completely new businesses based on opportunities from COVID only; rather, COVID can, timing-wise, really spark the launch or growth for some and significantly slow down the growth pace for others.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We invest as per normal and see that there is still a lot of capital ready to be deployed in Norway. Our companies have received a lot of soft funding from government initiatives, which is a huge and highly appreciated help to our portfolio companies. For our startups, and most others, the advice is always to keep the burn rate at manageable levels during this time of extra uncertainty, and plan the fundraising strategy accordingly. Otherwise, it&#8217;s never been more important to be lean and agile. The founders that are able to navigate well in a context with lots of uncertainty can do really well in the current climate!</p>
<h2>Daniel Holth Larsen, principal, Investinor</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Resource efficiency, healthier lifestyles, internet of behaviors, how we work and learn.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Dignio (SaaS/medtech).</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Forestry technology; a lot of focus on agriculture, but not forestry. Massive market opportunity, well positioned for SDGs, and driven by megatrends (building with wood, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
In general: Proven scalability in a massive global market opportunity, with a (both) nice and savvy founding team.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I think the consumer fintech space will get hard for startups in the coming years. Banks and institutions have competitive advantages through their large customer bases and access to resources and are investing heavily in the space (both through M&amp;A, but more importantly with in-house initiatives and projects).</li>
<li>Not one particular product per se, but I&#8217;m concerned about nice-to-have enterprise products that are not embedded and adapted in several departments of the customer (i.e., a marketing tool solely used by the marketing team at an organization, or a procurement tool used exclusively by procurement). I think many of these services will have a hard time in the tailwinds of COVID, and I think it is essential to get noticed by C-suites and other departments to survive in the longer run (regardless of your size and number of customers).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%. We are the largest and most active player in Norway by far. In 2020, we did 16 new direct investments, more than 60 follow-up investments, four IPOs, six investments in other venture funds, two complete exits.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The Norwegian ecosystem will continue to thrive and be more and more relevant internationally in regards to software, particularly B2B software. This is driven by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leading technological adaption and usage by the government, institutions and business.</li>
<li>Low risk in career changes: talent fluctuating from leading companies to startups.</li>
<li>Leading support and growth financing initiatives: Innovation Norway, funds, etc.</li>
<li>Great global market access: EU networks, foreign investments, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we especially have advantages in subsectors like proptech, energy, healthcare and education. I&#8217;m particularly excited about Kahoot, Cognite, Dignio (portfolio), Xeneta (portfolio), Gelato, Play Magnus (portfolio) and reMarkable.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Transparent way of doing business: honest, close to zero corruption;</li>
<li>High grade of innovation and many opportunities;</li>
<li>Happy population = happy founders and FTEs, and high productivity;</li>
<li>Favorable policies and regulation (policies and legal proceedings, IPOs, etc.);</li>
<li>No language barriers;</li>
<li>Significant support from government, institutions and local business.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Maybe, maybe not. I still think cities will be the most prominent location for startups as (1) Big business is not rural, and startup founders typically come from banks, consultancies, corporations, etc. and also recruit from the likes of it; and (2) Network access and information is more vast in cities, and even though people are currently staying at home, geographical proximity remains a key factor.<br />
This might happen in the longer run as more corporations recruit more people remotely, but I don&#8217;t see this happening the next following years as a consequence of our situation today. I think it will take more time.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Oil and gas; we have not made any new investments the last three years, but still have some companies in our portfolio (mostly specific technologies for the O&amp;G industries). Its attractiveness was obviously declining pre-COVID as well, but the crisis has only made the sustainable shift stronger. I don&#8217;t see it rebounding to its previous levels. I think startups have opportunities in business partnerships cross-industry, and we are seeing many examples of that now. I also think that software companies that are thriving in the current market have a clear upper hand in building sustainable long-term cultures in their organizations and attracting talent from those other industries affected (travel, aviation, O&amp;G, retail, hotels and accommodation, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Hasn&#8217;t impacted it in a big way as most of our companies are performing well. Founders are primarily concerned with the mental health of their employees. My advice: CEOs should especially spend a lot of time on vision and goals, culture, teamwork and collectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, last year was a record year for us both in terms of exits, IPOs and gross IRR in the portfolio. More than 80% of invested capital is in software, hardware and healthcare, and most of our companies are thriving. We see some, but very few, being negatively affected in a big way.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I&#8217;m doing well personally, but I have enjoyed seeing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our fantastic team members and founders getting the recognition they deserve.</li>
<li>Stagnating unemployment, people getting back to work.</li>
<li>Increased focus on mental health and wellbeing from organizations, the press and government.</li>
</ol>

We invest across all digital tech, but some of the areas we have been looking more into lately include health tech, future of work, event and creative tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment was a follow-on investment in PortalOne, the world’s first hybrid games company. PortalOne converges gaming, shows and the broader entertainment industry into one platform in a really fun and engaging way. It is like nothing you have ever seen before. Spun out of Oslo, they are soon ready to launch in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
One space that continues to evolve is the integration of social into various sectors &#8212; e.g., social fitness, social shopping, etc. And particularly, how we can recreate the connections that we make in the physical world in the digital version, leveraging the unique accessibility and reach that the digital platform offers.<br />
We also think there are significant advancements to be made within the privacy sector against a backdrop of increased data vulnerability and third-party access to information.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Brilliant and ambitious founder teams. And being in Norway, we want them to target a much larger and hopefully also global market pretty soon after launch. Norway and the Nordics are perfect testing pits, with a digitally advanced, high-trust population, but too small a market for most tech companies that want to become big.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We believe that most areas pretty fast become crowded, and try to avoid companies that do only incremental improvements in oversaturated areas. But we don’t necessarily avoid competition if the businesses have a transformative technology and see solutions or have secrets that others have not yet seen.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
So far we’ve been focused on Norwegian companies only, but with our upcoming fund, we will be pan-Nordic. We expect that about 50% of our investments will be Norwegian, whereas the other 50% will be spread across Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We see a good variety of exciting companies from Oslo and Norway. Kahoot, Spacemaker, Cognite and Pexip have been leading the way lately, with new ones like Memory, Tibber, PortalOne, reMarkable and many others coming right behind. We also believe that Norway’s strong roots with industrial companies now seem to move into tech, for example with a highly skilled workforce moving over from the oil and gas industry, as well as really exciting companies coming out of this area &#8212; Cognite being a strong example. Norway also has some unique strengths in ocean tech, renewable energy, agriculture and shipping, all fields that we believe will produce exciting startups built around tech advancements.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Oslo is a city with a strong foundation and an exciting momentum in tech. There’s too few local VCs, though, and that creates a funding gap around the Series A stage, but at the same time lots of opportunities for investors taking their time to get to know the ecosystem. They should know that the Nordics are fragmented, so it’s not enough to know Stockholm; they should also invest time in the other Nordic hubs in order to succeed with a Nordic investment strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The trend of remote work will increase. We have portfolio companies that don’t even have an office today; Confrere, for instance, which offers a video meeting and conferencing platform currently focused primarily on the healthcare sector, has all their employees working remote. But we also see a strong advantage of companies being tightly connected to a startup hub, there is so much learning, inspiration and network to be shared. Hopefully we’ll see even more minihubs being built around the country, and them connecting tightly to each other. There is a lot of potential in more and better collaboration between the different hubs, locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Some of the industry segments that look weaker are business travel, retail and hospitality. Exciting opportunities exist within event, games, work tools and efficiency, health tech and sustainability. One particularly interesting challenge is to understand and anticipate which of the trends that have arisen during these times will be temporary and which will be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Some areas have developed fast, and that impacts which areas we focus on. The biggest worries on the portfolio side have been (1) that their B2B sales will be affected and (2) that the investment climate will be more challenging. Our advice has been to secure a long runway for some companies, whereas other companies have accelerated because of the shifts caused by COVID-19 and need to run even faster.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, the first two months were hard for some of the portfolio companies, but after that things recovered and they mostly are back at the revenue growth that they planned for before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
At SNÖ we often draw the comparison between being a founder and the proud heritage we have in Norway with polar explorers and their great expeditions. What our founders have shown the last year, through these uncertain times, gives me good hope that this comparison is valid like never before. Entrepreneurs are the polar explorers of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know.</strong><br />
There are many in the Oslo scene that have contributed a lot during the last few years; Rolf Assev, Alexander Woxen, Per Einar Dybvik, Tor Bækkelund, Kjetil Holmefjord at StartupLab, Ingar Bentsen and Hans Christian Bjørne at TheFactory, Anniken Fjelberg at 657, Anders Mjåset at Mesh, Heidi Aven at SHE, Knut Wien and Maja Adriaensen at Startup Norway, Lucas H. Weldeghebriel and Per-Ivar Nikolaisen at Shifter. And many more. All great people who deserve praise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm said on Tuesday it is turning NFC-enabled Android smartphones into point-of-sale machines, as it looks to win more merchants in one of the world&#8217;s largest mobile payments markets.</p>
<p>A Paytm merchant partner will now be able to enable card acceptance feature from their Paytm Business app. Once activated, they will be able to process a transaction by tapping a plastic card to their phone.</p>
<p>Paytm Smart POS supports Visa, Mastercard, and Rupeek, the Indian startup said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Existing payment devices in the market haven’t proven very successful in reaching small and medium sized businesses in India, most of which remain offline, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of Paytm, at a virtual press conference today.</p>
<p>To win these merchants, Paytm has in recent years rolled out QR codes that work across several payment networks, and launched jukeboxes and other gadgets to make it easier for merchants to accept payments digitally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2122742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="493" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=768,370 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=680,327 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/paytm-smart-pos.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>With today’s move, said Sharma, “the obligation of buying a POS machine, too, is no longer needed.” The startup said that most new Android smartphone models support the NFC feature.</p>
<p>Paytm also unveiled the newer generation jukebox POS that looks similar to a QR placard. &#8220;The reason why merchants haven&#8217;t actively adopted many of the existing POS machines is that they are not comfortable with it,&#8221; said Dilip Asbe, head of payments body NPCI, at the virtual conference.</p>
<p>The Indian startup, which processed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/paytm-claims-top-spot-in-india-mobile-payments-market-with-1-2-billion-monthly-transactions/">more than 1.2 billion transactions last month</a>, said it will charge a small subscription fee to merchant partners for accessing either of the aforementioned payments services.</p>
<p>The move, which in many ways pits Paytm against Sequoia Capital-backed Pine Labs, a market leader in the POS category but a significantly smaller startup, demonstrates just how aggressively Paytm is expanding its payments platform to go after merchants.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;Just the way, mobile phones saw an evolution from featurephone to smartphone, we believe the merchant PoS market in India is at an inflexion point to evolve from the traditional (aka dumb-PoS) to Smart-PoS. Unlike traditional PoS, which only allows transactions from debit/credit-card, some of the features of a Smart-PoS are: GST compliant bill, scanner/printer, takes all payments including UPI, is Bluetooth enabled and could be customized for different merchants as per their needs. While currently the Fintech companies are offering these devices, we expect banks to catch-up eventually,&#8221; wrote analysts at Bank of America in a recent note to clients.</p>

<p>&#8220;Microinfluencers&#8221; are gaining clout among marketers. Though they may have as little as a thousand followers, microinfluencers tend to focus on specific content and be seen as more engaging and trustworthy by their audience, said Allan Ko, founder and chief executive officer of Influenxio. The Taipei-based startup, which connects brands with Instagram microinfluencers through its online platform, announced today that it has closed $2 million in pre-Series A funding led by DCM Ventures, and is launching a new subscription plan.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Influenxio has now raised over $3 million in total, including from seed investor SparkLabs Taipei. It currently operates in Taiwan and Japan, where it has databases of 100,000 and 250,000 Instagram creators, respectively. So far, over 6,000 brands have registered on Influenxio&#8217;s platform, and it has been used to run over 1,000 campaigns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Influenxio plans to use its new funding for hiring and product development. Influenxio&#8217;s new subscription plan is a relatively novel model for the field, so one of the startup&#8217;s goals is to prove that it works, Ko told TechCrunch. The company also plans to build out its Japanese platform and expand into more countries.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122728" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122728" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122728" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?w=680" alt="A screenshot of Influenxio's platform" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Influenxio-Product-Picture_Applied-Influencers.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122728" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of Influenxio&#8217;s platform</p></div></p>
<p>Influenxio analyzes past campaigns, performance data and client reviews to improve its algorithms. Since the entire campaign creation process&#8211;from finding influencers to paying them&#8211;is performed through Influenxio, this allows it to gather a wide range of data to refine its technology, Ko told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Influencers typically make about $35 to $40 USD for each campaign they participate in, and most of the brands the company works with focus on food (like restaurants), fashion, beauty or lifestyle services.</p>
<p>Before launching Influenxio, Ko spent 15 years working in the digital marketing field, serving as an account manager at Yahoo! and Microsoft, and then head of Hong Kong and Taiwan for Google&#8217;s online partnerships group. He wanted to create a startup that would combine what he had learned about digital marketing and make accessible to more businesses.</p>

<p>Large brands have used Influenxio to quickly generate marketing campaigns for special occasions like Mother&#8217;s Day or Christmas. For example, one advertiser in Taiwan used Influenxio to hire almost 200 influencers in one week, who were asked to test and post about their products, and some of Influenxio’s highest profile clients include Shiseido, Shopee, iHerb and KKBox.</p>
<p>But the majority of Influenxio&#8217;s clients (about 80% to 90%) are small- to medium-sized businesses, and Ko said they usually create multiple campaigns to build brand awareness over time, working with a few influencers a month.</p>
<p>Influenxio&#8217;s new subscription plan, which costs less than $100 USD a month and is launching first in Taiwan before rolling out to other markets, was created for them. &#8220;The first year we launched the platform, we found small businesses want experts and advice,&#8221; said Ko. Many don’t have marketing managers, so Influenxio&#8217;s subscription plan automatically matches them with new influencers each month and provides them with analytics so they can see how well campaigns are performing.</p>
<p>Influenxio is among a growing number of startups that are tapping into the &#8220;microinfluencer economy,&#8221; with others including AspireIQ, Upfluence and Grin.</p>
<p>Ko said Influenxio&#8217;s biggest difference is its focus on small businesses, and serving as a one-stop marketplace for influencer campaigns. &#8220;The important thing for our platform is that it needs to be very easy and simple,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We spent a lot of time on the execution and details to make it smoother on the advertiser side. For the influencer side, we try to make it more convenient. For example, the way they receive money, our goal is to also make it easy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kia started the year by dropping &#8220;motor company&#8221; from its corporate name and revealing a new logo and slogan as part of Plan S, a strategy to shift its business away from internal combustion engines and towards EVs, mobility services and autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>Now, the South Korean automaker is starting to share more details of the first vehicle that will come out of <a href="https://press.kia.com/eu/en/home/media-resouces/press-releases/2020/Plan_S.html">Plan S</a>. Kia released Tuesday several teaser images of the EV6, its first dedicated battery-electric vehicle built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP platform. This platform is shared with Hyundai and is the underlying foundation of the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 compact crossover.</p>
<p>These are teasers and so the vehicle isn&#8217;t shown in full. But even with the limited view enough design features are visible to begin to understand what Kia&#8217;s design language means for the EV6 and its other future electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EV6 is a four-door crossover, which isn&#8217;t a surprise considering the popularity of such vehicles in the U.S. The low front end moves up into a roofline that is reminiscent of a coupe. The LED headlights have a segmented pattern and the traditional grille found on internal combustion engine vehicles is gone.</p>

<p>The company also revealed a new naming scheme to help consumers easily identify the EVs in its lineup. Kia said its new dedicated battery electric vehicles will all start with the &#8220;EV&#8221; prefix. A number will follow &#8220;EV&#8221; to indicate the vehicle&#8217;s position the line-up. That puts the EV6 somewhere in the middle of its upcoming lineup.</p>
<p>Kia said the EV6 will make its world premiere during the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to design the physical experience of our brand and to create bold, original and inventive electric vehicles,&#8221; Karim Habib, senior vice president and head of Kia Global Design Center, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kia&#8217;s strategy is more ambitious though than creating bold, original and inventive electric vehicles. The company said last year that it wanted to become a pioneer in the age of EVs, a brand beloved by the millennial generation and Z generation and a symbol of challenge and innovation. Kia has placed sales and product goals behind those aspirational objectives, including the launch of 11 EVs by 2025 that will give it a 6.6% global EV market share, selling 500,000 electric vehicles annually by 2026, and offering customized purpose-built electric vehicles for corporate customers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also putting some capital behind the effort, to the tune of 29 trillion won (US $25 billion) by the end of 2025.  Kia said its targeting a 6% operating profit margin and 10.6% return on equity (ROE) ratio during this time period.</p>
<p>The EV6 is the first product of Plan S, a vehicle that will show investors and consumers if Kia&#8217;s grand plans are achievable. In other words, the EV6 is important for Kia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, the developer of popular gaming title PUBG Mobile, has invested $22.4 million in Indian esports firm Nodwin Gaming, the two firms said Tuesday as the South Korean firm looks to maintain some presence in what was once its key overseas market.</p>
<p><a href="http://nodwingaming.com">Nodwin Gaming</a>, a subsidiary of local gaming giant Nazara, has established itself as one of the largest esports firms in India.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm today works with several firms including Blizzard Entertainment, Valve, Riot Games, ESL to help them host events, provide commentary, produce and license content, and amass brands and sponsors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nodwin, which recently expanded to Africa, will deploy the fresh capital to accelerate its growth in international markets, it said.</p>
<p>Krafton and Nodwin have been engaging with one another for some time. The two firms last week announced that they will be collaborating to hold two PUBG Mobile events in Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Esports will be a key pillar to the growth of sports entertainment in the future. It sits at a wonderful intersection of sports, entertainment and technology where nations such as India can pave the path. With Krafton coming on board, we have an endorsement from the mecca of gaming and esports &#8212; South Korea &#8212; on what we are building from India for the world based on our competence in mobile first markets,&#8221; said Akshat Rathee, co-founder and managing director of Nodwin Gaming, in a statement.</p>
<p>India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned PUBG Mobile</a> and hundreds of other apps with affiliation to China last year citing cybersecurity concerns. Krafton has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">attempting to bring PUBG Mobile back in India</a>, but hasn’t had any luck yet.</p>
<p>To assuage New Delhi’s concerns about users’ security, Krafton said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with Chinese publisher Tencent</a>. (It also inked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/pubg-mobile-plots-return-to-india-following-ban/">global cloud deal with Microsoft</a>.) Sean Hyunil Sohn, the head of Corporate Development at Krafton, said earlier this month at a gaming conference that the firm “<a href="https://in.ign.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-mobile-iphone/155759/news/pubg-mobile-india-release-date-krafton-will-work-hard-to-make-it-happen">will work hard</a>” to bring PUBG Mobile back in India, but didn’t elaborate.</p>
<p>“Krafton is excited to partner with Nodwin Gaming to help foster the promising esports ecosystem and engage with our fans and players in India,” said Changhan Kim, chief executive of Krafton in a statement.</p>
<p>“Taking the momentum from this partnership, we will explore additional investment opportunities in the region to uphold our commitment and dedication in cultivating the local video game, esports, entertainment, and tech industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released a set of security updates for iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. There are no new features — but these are updates you will still want to install.</p>
<p>As part of these security fixes, iPhones and iPads will <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212221">update to iOS and iPadOS 14.4.1</a>, watchOS users <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212222">will update to 7.3.2</a> and macOS Big Sur <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212220">will update to 11.2.3</a>. Those on older versions of macOS can install the latest version of Safari, bumping <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212223">the version to 14.0.3</a>.</p>
<p>Apple says these are &#8220;important&#8221; security updates and are &#8220;recommended for all users.&#8221;</p>
<p>These patches fix the same vulnerability — a memory corruption bug in WebKit, the engine that powers Apple&#8217;s Safari browser. The bug can be triggered by visiting a malicious web page containing code that can exploit the vulnerability. Once exploited, an attacker can run malicious code on the affected Apple device.</p>
<p>The bugs were reported by Google and Microsoft, but are not believed to be actively exploited by malicious hackers unlike recent security flaws.</p>
<p>Last month, Apple pushed out iOS 14.4 to fix three WebKit vulnerabilities that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">were being &#8220;actively exploited.&#8221;</a> The vulnerabilities were chained together to break into the underlying iPhone software.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, update today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter from TechCrunch all about space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Mondays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes even the biggest successes look like failures on video. That&#8217;s the theme of this week, because the biggest news by far was SpaceX&#8217;s test launch of its latest Starship prototype in South Texas.</p>
<h3>It looked fake &#8212; but the fireball proved it wasn&#8217;t</h3>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s test flight was a launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/spacexs-starship-prototype-flies-to-32000-feet-and-sticks-the-landing-in-third-flight-test/">10th Starship prototype, to a height of around 32,000 feet</a>, at which point it used its Raptor engines to flip into a flop maneuver and then fall back to Earth in a roughly horizontal orientation, before re-lighting its engines very near the ground and flipping back vertical for a soft landing. All of which actually happened as described, for the first time, causing many TC readers to suggest it was an elaborate CG fake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t &#8212; after SpaceX cameras cut away, but while others were luckily still filming, the SN10 prototype met the same fiery end as the last two SpaceX rockets that did the high-flying act. The explosion that totally destroyed the rocket happened a few minutes after it sat stationary post-landing, and while it maybe didn&#8217;t provide the best optics, the real takeaway is that SpaceX proved the crazy landing maneuver Starship will use for reusability actually works in real-world conditions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2066317" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2066317" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2066317" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Starlink-UT.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2066317" class="wp-caption-text">Starlink&#8217;s UT antenna for residential customers.</p></div></p>
<p>SpaceX kinda needs the Starship to start working more and more often, because the big new rocket has a lot of work to do. As the space company continues to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/spacex-launches-60-new-starlink-satellites-while-starship-moves-closer-to-being-able-to-launch-up-to-400-at-a-time/">Starlink satellites, including 60 more this past week</a>, it really wants to be launching up to 400 at a time using Starship&#8217;s generous cargo compartment. And there are humans waiting in the wings for a Starship ride, too: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who bought out an entire Starship mission for a trip around the moon and back in 2023, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spacexs-first-paying-moon-flight-customer-wants-to-give-away-eight-seats-aboard-his-spaceship/">opened applications for eight other passengers who will join him &#8212; at his expense</a>.</p>

<h3>The SPAC man closes out his personal stake</h3>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya, the chairman of Virgin Galactic, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/virgin-galactic-chairman-chamath-palihapitiya-sells-off-remaining-personal-stake-in-the-space-company/">sold his entire personal stake in the company</a> after ushering it into the public markets last year via a SPAC merger with his Social Capital Hedosophia. Palihapitiya still retains a 6.2% ownership stake via that vehicle, in partnership with Ian Osborne, but his own independent holdings are now at zero.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121532" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121532" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2121532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg" alt="Chamath Palihapitiya" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10573763856_959b93767d_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Palihapitiya says he &#8220;remains as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic&#8217;s team, mission and prospects,&#8221; and that the only reason he liquidated his position was to provide funds for a climate-focused investment he&#8217;ll be taking the lid off soon. Public market investors seem not to have retained the same confidence, however, with price down consistently since news of the chairman&#8217;s sale came out last week.</p>
<h3>Early Stage</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Early Stage</a> is the premier “how-to” event for startup entrepreneurs and investors. You’ll hear firsthand how some of the most successful founders and VCs build their businesses, raise money and manage their portfolios.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, a well-known no-code automation tool, has purchased <a href="https://www.makerpad.co/">Makerpad</a>, a no-code education service and community. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered Zapier often during its life, including its first, and only, fundraising event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/zapier-raises-1-2m-seed-round/">a $1.2 million round</a> back in 2012 that tapped Bessemer, DFJ and others. Since then the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/zapier-launches-250month-team-accounts/">added more expensive tiers to its service</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/zapier-makes-it-easier-for-teams-to-collaborate-on-their-app-workflows/">built out team-focused features</a>, and recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/zapier-ceo-wade-foster-on-scaling-a-remote-team-up-to-300-employees/">talked to Extra Crunch</a> about how it scaled its remote-only team.</p>
<p>In an interview Monday, Zapier CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/wadefoster?lang=en">Wade Foster</a> told TechCrunch that his company now has 400 workers and crossed the $100 million ARR mark last summer.</p>
<p>The Makerpad deal is its first acquisition. TechCrunch asked Makerpad founder <a href="https://twitter.com/bentossell">Ben Tossell</a> about the structure of the deal, who said via email that his company will operate as a &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; entity from its new parent company.</p>
<p>The deal doesn&#8217;t seem prepped to upend what the smaller startup was working on before it was signed. &#8220;Ultimately,&#8221; Tossell wrote, &#8220;Makerpad&#8217;s vision is to educate as many people as possible on the possibilities of building without writing code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foster seems content with that focus, describing to TechCrunch how he intends to let Makerpad operate largely independently, albeit inside a set of editorial guidelines.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked the Makerpad founder why this was the right time to sell his business. He said that the pairing would help his team take the no-code world farther than it could alone, also noting that the deal was a &#8220;no-brainer&#8221; over &#8220;alternative routes such as VC funding.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tracking the growth of low-code, no-code startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/tracking-the-growth-of-low-code-no-code-startups/embed/#?secret=c4sAZJYuus" data-secret="c4sAZJYuus" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The acquisition was partially driven by a single tweet. <a href="https://twitter.com/smalter/status/1305964910866771969">This one</a>, in fact. According to Tossell, the CEO of Zapier reached out after reading it, leading to conversations and a deal. Foster expanded on the story during a call, saying that he had long followed Tossell&#8217;s work and that the two had met previously at dinners. The tweet wound up in his Slack, he said, so he reached out to the Makerpad founder, and from there it was a pretty quick ramp to a deal.</p>
<p>The two companies have seen rapid growth in recent quarters. Foster detailed to TechCrunch how small businesses have become increasingly reliant on his company&#8217;s service in the post-COVID world, with Zapier seeing strong SMB adoption after the pandemic hit. Given the digital transformation&#8217;s acceleration, that&#8217;s a trend that likely won&#8217;t slow soon. And Tossell told TechCrunch that no-code has already &#8220;grown bigger than [he] had imagined it could,&#8221; with his company seeing users expanding 4x in just under the last year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=34BLMCvUwu" data-secret="34BLMCvUwu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zapier, perhaps one of the largest success stories in the broad swath of technology products that we might call the no-code world, now has an attached community that could help directly add users to its service, and perhaps indirectly by making the aggregate pool of no-coders larger over time.</p>
<p>The no-code space has been active in recent months, as has its sibling niche, the low-code market. The latter has seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">recent rounds in the nine figures</a>, as some corporations turn to low-code tools to help them more quickly build internal software. The no-code world has its own successes, like Zapier&#8217;s nine-figure revenues.</p>
<p>Foster was neutral on more acquisitions, neither closing the door on them when TechCrunch asked, but not opening it any wider at the same time. On the SPAC question, however, the CEO was a bit clearer. That&#8217;s a no.</p>
<p>After having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">spoken to a grip of no-code</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/">and low-code founders</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/">and investors</a> in recent months, it seems clear that the broader business market is coming around to low-code services and that smaller companies have been quick adopters of no-code tooling. As low-code tools become increasingly abstracted from coding, and no-code tools add functionality, perhaps we&#8217;ll see the two related categories merge.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Americans are bored, housebound and screened out. This has created a golden opportunity for audio as consumers turn to podcasts, voice assistants and smart speakers — often at the same time.</p>
<p>Roughly 128 million Americans use a voice assistant <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/voice-assistant-and-smart-speaker-users-2020">at least once a month</a>. Smartphones account for most voice assistants, but there are also <a href="https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://marketingland.com/roughly-1-in-4-u-s-adults-now-owns-a-smart-speaker-according-to-new-report-273994&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615316037338000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7XyfWLp9_d5MaFpOP3194pzC8zw">nearly 160 million smart speakers in American homes.</a></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Hundreds of hardware and software makers are not easily ceding control of their users to the tech giants, and instead are seeking to introduce their own solutions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>One of the hottest forms of audio content is, of course, podcasts. Listeners have never had so many choices for smart and compelling podcast content, with new exciting shows emerging daily. On the consumption side, monthly podcast listeners <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2020/">topped 100 million</a> for the first time in 2020, a 40% increase in just two years.</p>
<p>Listeners get their podcasts from dedicated podcast apps (such as Stitcher), publisher apps (like NPR’s), music apps (such as Spotify), or their default phone app or voice assistant. With more than <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/">1.7 million podcasts</a> being produced today, even the most dedicated podcast listeners can’t listen to every episode in their queue.</p>
<p>This is where voice assistants come in.</p>
<p>The major voice assistants — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung — dominate, but they face increasing competition for users from white-label voice assistants. This has become a battle that will be decided by whichever company can provide the best quality of service.</p>
<p>That’s why the voice assistant that can personalize podcasts and help listeners search, sample and discover content through shareable bite-sized pieces will win the voice wars.</p>
<h2>A familiar battle over users</h2>
<p>Early consumer electronics battles for users were waged over the operating system — Windows vs. Mac. Voice is another form of operating system and the battle over voice is no less fierce.</p>
<p>Apple’s Siri was the first modern virtual assistant to reach the masses. Amazon and Google have also heavily invested — <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/why-tech-giants-are-so-desperate-to-provide-your-voice-assistant">often at a loss</a> — to own voice activation for users, grab market share and protect their turf (e-commerce for Amazon and search for Google).</p>
<p>Amazon took <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-opens-its-voice-assistant-to-developers-as-it-pursues-alexa-and-siri-1541151843">24% of the virtual assistant market in 2018</a>, followed by Apple (22%), Google (20%), Microsoft’s Cortana (10%) (largely confined to desktop) and Samsung’s Bixby (6%).</p>
<p>These five major brands were early pioneers, but the next phase of the voice wars will be white-labeled, with voice assistants incorporated into all devices and brands.</p>
<h2>The rise of white-label voice assistants</h2>
<p>Unable to develop their own voice assistants, hundreds of device manufacturers must resort to Google or Alexa if they want to add voice functionality to their products. But in a way, this is a Trojan horse: Adding Google or Alexa voice enhances products but undermines user relationships.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As an early-stage founder, how do you identify the right investors? Or know how to hire the best possible team to set up your company for growth? Should you bootstrap, and if so, how do you do it successfully? How do you nail virtual pitch meetings?

<h2>The All-22 View (Eghosa Omoigui — EchoVC Partners)</h2>
<p>Improving line of sight and dynamic field of play aperture is rarely discussed but hugely important.

<h2>An M&amp;A Playbook for Startup Founders: Lessons from Google and Microsoft (brought to you by <a href="http://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>)</h2>

<h2>Why Founders Should Adopt OKRs Now? (brought to you by <a href="https://dell.to/TechCrunch">Dell for Entrepreneurs</a>)</h2>
<p>Execution is key to a startup&#8217;s survival and growth especially when it comes to fast-moving software and technology products. Being in the tricky intersection of investors, customers and employees, a founder needs to balance priorities, align teams and create a visionary product that works. Moreover, in this age of hyperfeedback loops and changing business models, the founder has to be agile enough to absorb and quickly react to changes in the product roadmap and consumer needs. OKRs — a toolkit used mostly by engineering and product teams is more than relevant now for founders of all kinds to embrace. Join the session to learn the history of OKRs, what they are about and witness case studies of successful real-life adoption.</p>
<h2>Naming and Protecting Your Company’s Intellectual Property (brought to you by <a href="http://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>)</h2>
<p>You have an idea for a game-changing product or service — what do you call it? Once you’ve picked a name, how do you make sure nobody else is using it? Is the domain and Twitter handle available? Brainbase makes it easy for anyone to file a trademark without a lawyer and instantly own your brand across all channels. In this session, Brainbase co-founder and CEO Nate Cavanaugh will explain the importance of owning your company’s trademark, both for brand protection and for fundraising due diligence.</p>
<h2>Nailing the Little Things: How Startups Can Achieve Operational Excellence from &#8220;Day One&#8221; (brought to you by <a href="https://www.bcapgroup.com/">B Capital Group</a>)</h2>
<p>The early days of launching a company can be a whirlwind for founding teams as unexpected challenges and opportunities require flexibility, agility and speed.

Join partners from B Capital Group, a multistage global investor, to learn about the most important things you can do to set your startup up for success early in your journey, and what will be most important to investors as you raise your Seed, A and B funding rounds. Speakers include Howard Morgan, chairman of B Capital Group and co-founder of First Round Capital, and partners Karen Page (formerly of Box) and Gabe Greenbaum (formerly of Pritzker Group).</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Obviously, we venture beyond electrification into autonomous vehicles and connectivity. There will be a lot of value creation once OEMs are able to surface their APIs."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since <a href="https://www.inmotionventures.com/">InMotion Ventures</a>, the independent investment and incubation initiative set up by <a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/">Jaguar Land Rover</a>, launched in 2016 the firm has focused on backing companies across the mobility space broadly. Its 15 active investments run the gamut from autonomous vehicles, to car insurance tech, to ride-sharing, and travel planning, but increasingly the firm is focusing its efforts on vehicle electrification and sustainable supply chains.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As the mobility market moves to embrace electrification, InMotion wants to make sure its portfolio is in the mix.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s evident from its most recent investment in <a href="https://www.circulor.com/">Circulor</a>, a company that monitors supply chains from raw material inputs to finished outputs with an eye toward sustainable sourcing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">As an OEM nowadays it’s increasingly important to have increasing transparency and visibility into how all of those materials have been sourced,&#8221; said the firm&#8217;s managing director, Sebastian Peck. Circulor already has a strong footprint in the automotive industry, Peck said, and is working with a major oil company on tracing the share of recycled plastics that have come from that provider. &#8220;It has applications across any industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Jaguar Land Rover is also using Circulor&#8217;s technology to track a material that&#8217;s being used in the interior of one of the company&#8217;s vehicles, Peck said. The stealthy project hasn&#8217;t been publicly revealed yet, but the company has worked with a university and supplier to trace the material from its point of origin to the finished product.</p>
<p>Sustainable supply chains aren&#8217;t the only priorities Peck laid out in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As the mobility market moves to embrace electrification, InMotion wants to make sure its portfolio is in the mix and Peck said it would be looking to make investments in a number of different areas around electric vehicles and batteries.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have looked at a number of companies who are developing new battery chemistries. We haven’t made an investment yet,&#8221; Peck said. &#8220;We don’t have a deep enough insight into the IP portfolios of the big battery suppliers to really be able to reliably benchmark those new chemistries. We have not had enough conviction to make an investment or back a particular company. From a value chain it is two or three steps away from us. It’s a space we’re looking at.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cosi-group.com/">Cosi Group</a>, a Berlin-based startup offering an alternative to boutique hotels and managed short-stay apartments, is disclosing €20 million in new investment.</p>
<p>Backing the round is Vienna-based Soravia, a leading real estate group in German-speaking countries. Existing investors Cherry Ventures, e.ventures, Kreos Capital and Bremke followed on, along with a number of individual investors. They are described as including the founders of Flixbus, Travelperk, Comtravo and Cosi&#8217;s own founders.</p>
<p>Cosi says it will use the fresh capital to accelerate international expansion in Europe, implement a new brand and launch a &#8220;new strategic business unit&#8221; soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iAvqWbzAFw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/cosi/">Cosi raises €5M for its &#8216;full-stack&#8217; hospitality alternative to boutique hotels</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cosi raises €5M for its &#8216;full-stack&#8217; hospitality alternative to boutique hotels&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/cosi/embed/#?secret=iAvqWbzAFw" data-secret="iAvqWbzAFw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Originally described as a tech-enabled or “full-stack” hospitality service that competes with well-run boutique hotels or traditional local managed apartments, the company signs long-term leases with property owners, and then furnishes those apartments itself to “control” the interior design experience. It claims to have digitised, and where possible, automated its processes in order to scale and maintain quality of service throughout the guest journey, from initial contact to loyalty.</p>
<p>Christian Gaiser, CEO of Cosi, tells me the startup has not only been able to mitigate the pandemic &#8212; which has seen major restrictions in travel, including countries going into full lockdown &#8212; but actually thrive. That&#8217;s because Cosi was able to tap &#8220;new demand channels&#8221; that aren&#8217;t reliant on holiday travel or short business trips.</p>
<p>Described as &#8220;midstay&#8221; (guests that stay for one month or longer), examples include people who arrive in a city and need a home for one or two months until they find a longer-term apartment, citizens who need to get away from shared apartments (perhaps to be less at risk or to work from home), or families who are building or renovating a house that faces construction delays due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, we were able to reach over 90% occupancy and managed to operate our locations on a cash-flow-positive scale,&#8221; adds the Cosi CEO. &#8220;Lesson learned for us: Even when almost all your demand channels dry out, you still can do a lot if you focus on what you can control. We simply activated new demand channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, he says the pandemic has accelerated a shift in demand preferences, seeing &#8220;big hotel bunkers&#8221; become less popular versus individual apartment style accommodations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cosi has also seen a &#8220;massive boost in supply,&#8221; with lots of takeover opportunities in the hotel space, especially for underperforming hotel properties. And since office space demand has contracted dramatically, the company is receiving offers to convert office space for use as midstay accommodation.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the back of our strong COVID performance, we&#8217;ve built a lot of trust among the real estate community and receive more and more offers,&#8221; says Gaiser. &#8220;Prices for supply have fallen sometimes dramatically, depending on the city, due to these factors&#8221;.</p>
<p>To that end, Cosi currently has 750 units under contract, with 1,500 more under negotiation.</p>
<p>Adds the Cosi CEO: &#8220;Now is exactly the right timing to double down on Cosi&#8217;s growth from a long-term perspective. When everyone is scared/shocked, you can win big if you have a clear plan. Our investors bought into this plan, as we have demonstrated that our business model is resilient and we also have the capacity to navigate the ship both in good but also in rough waters.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the nearly 10 years since it launched as a whole animal butchery out of a storefront in East Nashville, the founders of <a href="https://porterroad.com/">Porter Road</a> have wanted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/porter-road-was-to-herd-the-meat-industry-in-a-new-direction/">herd America&#8217;s meat industry down a new path</a>.</p>
<p>Now the company has $10 million in financing from investors including L37 Ventures, River Park Ventures, Middleland, FJ Labs, Kelvin Beachum along with previous investors MAX Ventures, Tribeca Venture Partners and Slow Ventures to bring that mission to a broader swath of the country.</p>
<p>Since the company bought its own slaughterhouse back in 2015 and expanded to e-commerce in 2018 it has been shipping its selections of lamb, beef, pork, chicken and sausages from local farms to tables across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Porter Road wants to herd the meat industry in a new direction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/30/porter-road-was-to-herd-the-meat-industry-in-a-new-direction/embed/#?secret=RVs5Q67POy" data-secret="RVs5Q67POy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new money will be used to scale the company&#8217;s sustainable agriculture and its pasture-raised meat for the direct-to-consumer business, its shop in Nashville and for wholesale distribution to restaurants around the country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to expand its operations in Princeton, Kentucky with a new USDA processing facility that&#8217;s 4.5 times larger to meet new demand. That move will create 80 new jobs in the small town and is part of a broader agricultural renaissance in Kentucky.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s easy to back founders who are as comfortable on the manufacturing line as they are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the boardroom, and who see the world differently and have the deep domain expertise to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">execute on that vision,&#8221; said L37 Partner Randall Ussery in a statement. &#8220;They have spent years perfecting the Porter Road way, which no</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">company nor incumbent can replicate overnight. They are a category killer in the meat industry</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and have built a moat around their brand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>One indication of the ways in which Porter Road differs from its larger competitors is in the way it handled the COVID-19 pandemic at its facilities.</p>
<p>Due to its limited production schedule and measures like staggered break times, mask requirements and social distancing rules, the company was able to avoid having any outbreaks at its facilities, according to the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, Chris Carter. &#8220;We had a handful of people who got sick, but [COVID-19] didn&#8217;t spread in Princeton,&#8221; said Carter.</p>
<p>Despite the push for more plant-based diets, Carter says that his company&#8217;s focus on pasture-raised animals and whole animal butchery should appeal to folks who care about sustainable production. &#8220;We care about our farmers and we care about the way our animals are raised,&#8221; said Carter. &#8220;That&#8217;s the whole point of what we&#8217;re doing …<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Porter Road is about animal utilization. It’s about honoring the life of an animal so we find an outlet for every single piece.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Porter Road is expanding its product line into cooking tallow and fats, and cross-cut bones for bone marrow dishes, Carter said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The food system is broken and in need of a substantial change. Today’s consumer is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">demanding a deeper level of connection to their food </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and can see past misleading labels and buzzwords,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said Carter, in a statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e are delivering trust, transparency and flavor so no one has to compromise, all while supporting our farmers.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced this morning it&#8217;s teaming up with Common Sense Media to curate a selection of kid-friendly podcasts in the U.S. in light of what appears to be growing interest in spoken-word entertainment among families. That interest, in part, may have been prompted by the pandemic and parents&#8217; desire to reduce kids&#8217; screen time for entertainment.</p>
<p>Via a new website at <a href="http://apple.co/showsforkids">Apple.co/showsforkids</a> (which launches Apple Podcasts), Apple has collaborated with Common Sense Media to group podcasts by age group as well as by theme. At launch, the collection features creators like Tinkercast, American Public Media, Gen-Z Media, Pinna, Tumble, Highlights, WNYC Studios, Rebel Girls and Nickelodeon, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to groups by age, there are also four thematic collections available: <em>Common Sense Media Picks</em>, which are all-time family favorites; <em>One More!,</em> which features mysterious tales and action-packed dramas; <em>Kids Know Best</em>, which feature shows picked by kids themselves; and <em>Story Time</em>, which are story-driven shows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2122364" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122364" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="483" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg 2794w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=768,545 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1091 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1454 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-12.28.04-PM.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> screenshot of Apple Podcasts</p></div></p>
<p>The site will be updated monthly to feature new and popular shows and to introduce timely collections around historical and cultural moments, like Women&#8217;s History Month or Back to School ideas, Apple says.</p>
<p>The company also notes the selection of shows is curated using the same sort of research-backed approach that Common Sense Media applies to other entertainment, like TV shows, movies, books, apps and games.</p>
<p>The launch follows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/apple-launches-apple-for-kids-support-page/">Apple&#8217;s recent debut of an &#8220;Apple for Kids&#8221; website</a> that helps parents set up devices for kids and learn about Family Sharing options, highlighting an increased interest in catering to the needs of families.</p>
<p>But unlike with kids&#8217; use of Apple devices, the current market for kids&#8217; podcasts is small &#8212; none of Apple&#8217;s top 100 podcasts are directed toward kids, for example.</p>
<p>However, industry experts believe the kids market may grow alongside the overall adult podcast market. Plus, as <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/11/10/podcasts-kids-parents-polling/">Morning Consult recently reported</a>, the COVID-19 pandemic has helped drive new interest in the audio format as parents struggled to keep kids entertained at home.</p>
<p>Case in point: one leading kids&#8217; podcast, &#8220;Wow in the World&#8221; by NPR, saw a 94% increase in downloads in the 13 weeks post-COVID compared with pre-COVID, the report said.</p>
<p>In another recent analysis, <a href="https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/insights/reports/the-spoken-word-audio-report/">NPR&#8217;s 2020 Spoken Word Audio Report</a> found that 15% of U.S. adults were now listening to children&#8217;s spoken word audio &#8212; an indication that many parents were already co-listening with kids. In addition, research from <a href="https://www.kidslisten.org/">Kids Listen</a>, a nonprofit advocacy group for kids&#8217; podcasts, found that 89% of kids who listen to podcasts are ages 8 or under, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/11/10/podcasts-kids-parents-polling/">Morning Consult pointed out.</a></p>
<p>Apple, it&#8217;s worth noting, has been rumored to be considering a new podcast subscription service to challenge Spotify, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify">The Information reported year earlier this year.</a> In the weeks since that report, Apple has seemingly begun to pay more attention to the format, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/apples-new-editorial-franchise-apple-podcasts-spotlight-to-highlight-interesting-creators/">launched a new editorial franchise, Apple Podcasts Spotlight,</a> to highlight interesting creators.</p>
<p>Adding kids&#8217; programing could play into Apple&#8217;s future ambitions, perhaps, as 64% of parents who listen to podcasts said they&#8217;re likely to purchase a paid subscription to podcasts for their kids.</p>
<p>The new collection is live in the U.S. in Apple Podcasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been over a year since Google began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">auctioning slots</a> for a search engine &#8220;choice&#8221; screen on Android in Europe, following a major antitrust intervention by the European Commission back in 2018. But despite hitting Google with a record-breaking fine over two years ago, almost nothing has changed.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s search market share remains undented and the most interesting regional search alternatives are being priced out of a Google-devised &#8220;remedy&#8221; that favors those who can pay the most to be listed as an alternative to its own dominant search engine on smartphones running Google&#8217;s Android OS.</p>
<p>Quarterly choice screen winners have been getting increasingly same-y. Alternatives to Google are expecting another uninspiring batch of &#8220;winners&#8221; to drop in short order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen-winners/">results for Q1 2021</a> were dominated by a bunch of ad-targeting search options few smartphone users would likely have heard of: Germany&#8217;s GMX; California-based info.com; and Puerto Rico-based PrivacyWall (which is owned by a company whose <a href="https://socialgamemedia.com/#services">website</a> is emblazoned with the slogan &#8220;100% programmatic advertising&#8221;) &#8212; plus another, more familiar (ad)tech giant&#8217;s search engine (Microsoft-owned) Bing.</p>
<p>Lower down the list: The Russian &#8220;Google&#8221; &#8212; Yandex &#8212; which won eight slots. And a veteran player in the Czech search market, Seznam.cz, which bagged two.</p>
<p>On the &#8220;big loser&#8221; side: Non-tracking search engine DuckDuckGo &#8212; which has been standing up for online privacy for over a decade yet won only one slot (in Belgium). It&#8217;s come to be almost entirely squeezed out versus<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/duckduckgo-still-critical-of-googles-eu-android-choice-screen-auction-after-wining-a-universal-slot/"> winning a universal slot in all markets</a> at the start of the auction process.</p>
<p>Tree-planting not-for-profit search engine <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">Ecosia</a> was almost entirely absent in the last round too: Gaining only one slot on the screen showed to Android users in Slovenia. Yet back in December Ecosia was added as a default search option with Safari on iOS, iPadOS and macOS &#8212; having grown its global usage to more than 15 million users.</p>
<p>While another homegrown European search option &#8212; which has a privacy-focus &#8212; France&#8217;s Qwant, went home with just one slot. And not in its home market, either (in tiny Luxembourg).</p>

<p>If Europe&#8217;s regulators had fondly imagined that a Google-devised &#8220;remedy&#8221; for major antitrust breaches they identified would automagically restore thriving competition to the Android search market, they should feel rudely awakened indeed. The bald fact is Google&#8217;s market share has not even been scratched, let alone dented.</p>
<p>Statista data for Google&#8217;s search market share on mobile (across both Android and iOS; the latter where the tech giant pays Apple billions of dollars annually to be set as the default on iPhones) shows that in February 2021 its share in Europe stood at 97.07% &#8212; up from 96.92% in July 2018 when the Commission made the antitrust ruling.</p>
<p>Yes, Google has actually <em>gained</em> share running this &#8220;remedy&#8221;.</p>
<p>By any measure that&#8217;s a spectacular failure for EU competition enforcement &#8212; more than 2.5 years after its headline-grabbing antitrust decision against Android.</p>

<p>The Commission has also been promoting a goal of European tech sovereignty throughout the period Google has been running this auction. President Ursula von der Leyen links this overarching goal to her digital policy programming.</p>
<p>On the measure of tech sovereignty the Android choice screen must be seen as a sizeable failure too &#8212; as it&#8217;s not only failed to support (most) homegrown alternatives to Google (another, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">Cliqz, pulled the plug on its search+browser effort entirely last year</a>, putting part of the blame on the region&#8217;s political stakeholders for failing to understand the need for Europe to own its own digital infrastructure) &#8212; but it&#8217;s actively burying the most interesting European alternatives by forcing them to compete against a bunch of ad-funded Google clones.</p>
<p>(And if Brave Search takes off it&#8217;ll be another non-European alternative &#8212; albeit, one that will have benefitted from expertise and tech that was made-in-Europe&#8230; )</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brave is launching its own search engine with the help of ex-Cliqz devs and tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/embed/#?secret=E4nLE3s8bh" data-secret="E4nLE3s8bh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is because the auction mechanism means only companies that pay Google the most can buy themselves a chance at being set as a default option on Android.</p>
<p>Even in the rare instances where European players shell out enough money to appear in the choice list (which likely means they&#8217;ll be losing money per search click) they most often do so alongside other non-European alternatives <em>and Google</em> &#8212; further raising the competitive bar for selection.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. Nor was it wasn&#8217;t initially; Google started with a choice screen based on market share.</p>
<p>However, it very quickly switched to a pay to play model &#8212; throttling at a stroke the discoverability of alternative business models that aren&#8217;t based on exploiting user data (or, indeed, aren&#8217;t profit-driven in Ecosia&#8217;s case; as it uses ad-generated revenue to fund tree planting with a purely environmental goal).</p>
<p>Such alternatives say they typically can&#8217;t afford to win Google&#8217;s choice screen auctions. (It&#8217;s worth noting that those who do participate in the game are restricted in what they can say as Google requires they sign an NDA.)</p>
<p>Clearly, it&#8217;s no coincidence that the winners of Google&#8217;s auction skew almost entirely to the track and target side of the tracks, where its own business sits; all data-exploiting business models bandied together. And then, from a consumer point of view, why would you <em>not</em> pick Google with such a poorly and artificially limited &#8220;choice&#8221; on offer &#8212; since you&#8217;re generally only being offered weaker versions of the same thing?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ecosia tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s now considering pulling out of the auction process altogether &#8212; which would be a return to its first instinct; which was to boycott the auction before saying it felt it had to participate. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A few months playing Google&#8217;s pay-to-play &#8220;no choice&#8221; (as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/googles-no-choice-screen-on-android-isnt-working-says-ecosia-querying-the-eus-approach-to-antitrust-enforcement/">Ecosia dubs the auction</a>) game has cemented its view that the system is stacked against genuine alternatives.  </span></p>

<p><span class="il">Over two auction rounds when Ecosia has only ended up winning the one slot each time it says it&#8217;s</span> seen no positive effect on user numbers. A decision on whether or not to withdraw entirely will be taken after the results of the next auction process are revealed, it said. (The next round of results are expected shortly, in early March.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We definitely realized it&#8217;s less and less &#8216;fun&#8217; to play the game,&#8221; Ecosia founder Christian Kroll told us. &#8220;It&#8217;s a super unfair game &#8212; where it&#8217;s not only &#8216;David against Goliath&#8217; but also Goliath gets to choose the rules, gets a free ticket, he can change the rules of game if he likes to. So it&#8217;s not amusing for us to participate in that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been participating now for nine months and if you look at overall market share in Europe nothing has changed. We don&#8217;t know the results yet of this round but I assume also nothing will change &#8212; the usual suspects will be there again&#8230; Most of the options that you see there now are not interesting to users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling it a &#8216;choice&#8217; screen is still a little bit ironic if you remove all the interesting choices from the screen. So the situation is still the same and it becomes less and less fun to play the game and at some point I think we might make the decision that we&#8217;re not going to be part of the game anymore,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Other alternative search engines we spoke to are continuing to participate for now &#8212; but all were critical of Google&#8217;s &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221; model for the Android &#8220;choice screen&#8221;.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo founder Gabriel Weinberg told us: &#8220;We are bidding, but only to help further expose to the European Commission how flawed Google&#8217;s rigged process really is, in hopes they will help more actively take a role in reforming it into something that actually works for consumers. Due to our strict privacy policy, we expect to be eliminated, same as last time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to a <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/search-preference-menu-duckduckgo-elimination/">blog post</a> the company put out last fall, denouncing the &#8220;fundamentally flawed&#8221; auction model &#8212; and saying that &#8220;whole piece still stands&#8221;. In the blog post the company wrote that despite being profitable since 2014 &#8220;we <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">have been priced out of this auction because we choose to not maximize our profits by exploiting our users&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In practical terms, this means our commitment to privacy and a cleaner search experience translates into less money per search. This means we must bid less relative to other, profit-maximizing companies,&#8221; DuckDuckGo went on, adding: &#8220;</span>This EU antitrust remedy is only serving to further strengthen Google’s dominance in mobile search by boxing out alternative search engines that consumers want to use and, for those search engines that remain, taking most of their profits from the preference menu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This auction format incentivizes bidders to bid what they can expect to profit per user selection. The long-term result is that the participating Google alternatives must give most of their preference menu profits to Google! Google’s auction further incentivizes search engines to be worse on privacy, to increase ads, and to not donate to good causes, because, if they do those things, then they could afford to bid higher,&#8221; it also said then.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s Qwant has been similarly critical and it told us it is &#8220;extremely dissatisfied&#8221; with the auction &#8212; calling for &#8220;urgent modification&#8221; and saying the 2018 Commission decision should be fully respected &#8220;in text and in spirit&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are extremely dissatisfied with the auction system. We are asking for an urgent modification of the Choice Screen to allow consumers to find the search engine they want to use and not just the three choices that are only the ones that pay the most Google. We demand full respect for the 2018 decision, in text and in spirit,&#8221; said CEO Jean-Claude Ghinozzi.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are reviewing all options and re-evaluating our decision on a quarterly basis. In any case, we want consumers to be able to freely choose the search engine they prefer, without being limited to the only three alternative choices sold by Google. Consumers&#8217; interests must always come first,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Yandex confirmed it has participated in the upcoming Q2 auction. But it was also critical of Google&#8217;s implementation, saying it falls short of offering a genuine &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221; to Android users.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We aim to offer high-quality and convenient search engine around the world. We are confident that freedom to select a search engine will lead to greater market competition and motivate each player to improve services. We don’t think that the current EU solution fully ensures freedom of choice for users, by only covering devices released from March 2020,&#8221; a Yandex spokeswoman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There are currently very few such devices on the EU market in comparison with the total number of devices in users&#8217; hands. It is essential to provide the freedom of choice that is genuine and real. Competition among service providers ultimately benefits users who will receive a better product.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One newcomer to the search space &#8212; the anti-tracking browser Brave (which, as we mentioned above, just bought up some Cliqz assets to underpin the forthcoming launch of an-own brand Brave Search) &#8212; confirmed it will not be joining in at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave does not plan to participate in this auction. Brave is about putting the user first, and this bidding process ignores users&#8217; best interests by limiting their choices and selecting only for highest Google Play Store optimizing bidders,&#8221; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An irony here is that Google gets to profit off its own remedy for being found guilty of anti-competitive tying of Chrome into Android,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Asked about its strategy to grow usage of Brave Search in the region &#8212; outside of participation in the Android choice screen &#8212; she said: &#8220;Brave already has localized browsers for the European market, and we will continue to grow by offering best-in-class privacy showcased in marketing campaigns and referrals programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s self-devised &#8220;remedy&#8221; followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018 antitrust decision by the Commission</a> &#8212; which led to a record-breaking $5 billion penalty and an order to cease a variety of infringing behaviors. The tech giant&#8217;s implementation remains under active monitoring by EU antitrust regulators. However, Kroll argues the Commission is essentially just letting Google buy time rather than fix the abusive behavior it identified.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google gets slapped with $5BN EU fine for Android antitrust abuse&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/embed/#?secret=9e2GUNi1yk" data-secret="9e2GUNi1yk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The way I see this at the moment is the Commission feels like the auction screen isn&#8217;t necessarily something that they&#8217;ve requested as a remedy so they can&#8217;t really force Google to change it &#8212; and that&#8217;s why they also maybe don&#8217;t see it as their responsibility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But at the same time they requested Google to solve the situation and Google isn&#8217;t doing anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are also allowing Google to get the credit from the press and also from users that it seems like Google is doing something &#8212; so they are allowing Google to play on time&#8230; I don&#8217;t know if a real choice screen would be a good solution but it&#8217;s also not for me to decide &#8212; it&#8217;s up to the European Commission to decide if Google has successfully remedied the damage&#8230; and has also compensated some of the damage that it&#8217;s done and I think that has not happened at all. We can see that in the [marketshare] numbers that basically still the same situation is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole thing is designed to remove interesting options from the screen,&#8221; he also argued of Google&#8217;s current &#8220;remedy&#8221;. &#8220;This is how it&#8217;s &#8216;working&#8217; and I&#8217;m of course disappointed that nobody is stepping in there. So we&#8217;re basically in this unfair game where we get beaten up by our competitors. And I would hope for some regulator to step in and say this is not how this should go. But this isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment our only choice is to hang in there but at the moment if we really see there is no effect and there&#8217;s also no chance that regulators will ever step in we still have the choice to completely withdraw and let Google have its fun but without us&#8230; We&#8217;re not only not getting anything out of the [current auction model] but we&#8217;re of course also investing into it. And there are also restrictions because of the NDA we&#8217;ve signed &#8212; and even those restrictions are a little bit of a pain. So we have all the negative effects and don&#8217;t get any benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>While limited by NDA in what he can discuss about the costs involved with participating in the auction, Kroll suggested the winners are doing so at a loss &#8212; pursuing reach at the expense of revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the bids from the last rounds I think with those bids it would be difficult for us to make money &#8212; and so potentially others have lost money. And that&#8217;s exactly also how this auction is designed, or how most auctions are designed, is that the winners often lose money&#8230; so you have this winner&#8217;s curse where people overbid,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This hasn&#8217;t happened to us &#8212; also because we&#8217;re super careful &#8212; and in the last round we won this wonderful slot in Slovenia. Which is a beautiful country but again it has no impact on our revenues and we didn&#8217;t expect that to happen. It&#8217;s just for us to basically participate in the game but not risk our financial health,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We know that our bids will likely not win so the financial risk [to Ecosia as it&#8217;s currently participating and mostly losing in the auction] is not that big but for the companies who actually win bids &#8212; for them it might be a different thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kroll points out that the auction model has allowed Google to continue harvesting market share while weakening its competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are quite a few companies who can afford to lose money in search because they just need to build up market share &#8212; and Google is basically harvesting all that and at the same time weakening its competitors,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;Because competitors need to spend on this. And one element that &#8212; at least in the beginning when the auction started &#8212; that I didn&#8217;t even see was also that if you&#8217;re a real search company&#8230; then you&#8217;re building up a brand, you&#8217;re building up a product, you&#8217;re making all these investments and you have real users &#8212; and if you have those then, if there was really a choice screen, people would naturally choose you. But in this auction screen model you&#8217;re basically paying for users that you would have anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s really putting those kind of companies at a disadvantage: DuckDuckGo, us, all kinds of companies who have a &#8216;real USP&#8217;. Also Lilo, potentially even Qwant as well if you have a more nationalist approach to search, basically. So all of those companies are put at an even bigger disadvantage. And that&#8217;s &#8212; I think &#8212; unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since most winners of auction slots are, like Google, involved in surveillance capitalism &#8212; gathering data on search users to profit off of ad targeting &#8212; if anyone was banking on EU competition enforcement being able to act as a lever to crack open the dominant privacy-hostile business model of the web (and allow less abusive alternatives get a foot in the door) they must be sorely disappointed.</p>
<p>Better alternatives &#8212; that do not track consumers for ads, or, in the case of Ecosia, are on an entirely non-profit mission &#8212; are clearly being squeezed out.</p>
<p>The Commission can&#8217;t say it wasn&#8217;t warned: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The moment the auction model was announced by Google <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-to-auction-slots-on-android-default-search-choice-screen-in-europe-next-year-rivals-cry-pay-to-play-foul/">rivals decried it</a> as flawed, rigged, unfair and unsustainable &#8212; warning it would put them at a </span>competitive disadvantage (exactly because they aren&#8217;t just cloning Google&#8217;s &#8220;track and target for ad profit model&#8221;).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission has so far shown itself unwilling or unable to respond &#8212; despite making a big show of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">proposing major new rules for the largest platforms</a> which it says are needed to ensure they play fair. But that raises the question of why it&#8217;s not better-enforcing existing EU rules against tech giants like Google?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When we raised criticism of Google&#8217;s Android choice screen auction model with the Commission</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it sent us its standard set of talking points &#8212; </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">writing that: &#8220;</span><span lang="EN-IE" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We have seen in the past that a choice screen can be an effective way to promote user choice&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The choice screen means that additional search providers are presented to users on start-up of every new Android device in every EEA country. So users can now choose their search provider of preference when setting up their newly purchased Android devices,&#8221; it also said, adding that it is </span><span lang="EN-IE" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;committed to a full and effective implementation of the decision&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are therefore monitoring closely the implementation of the choice screen mechanism,&#8221; it added &#8212; a standard line since Google begin its &#8220;compliance&#8221; with the 2018 EU decision. </span></p>
<p>In a slight development, the Commission did also confirm it has had discussions with Google about the choice screen mechanism &#8212; <span lang="EN-IE">following what it described as &#8220;relevant feedback from the market&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">It said these discussions focused on &#8220;the presentation and mechanics of the choice screen and to the selection mechanism of rival search providers&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>But with the clock ticking, and genuine alternatives to Google search being actively squeezed out of the market &#8212; leaving European consumers to be offered no meaningful choice to privacy-hostile search on Android &#8212; you do have to wonder what regulators are waiting for?</p>
<p>A pattern of reluctance to challenge tech giants where it counts seems to be emerging from Margrethe Vestager&#8217;s tenure at the helm of the competition department (and also, since 2019, a key shaper of EU digital policy).</p>
<p>Despite gaining a reputation for being willing to take on tech giants &#8212; and hitting Google (and others) with a number of headline-grabbing fines over the past five+ years &#8212; she cannot claim success in rebalancing the market for mobile search nor smartphone operating systems nor search ad brokering, in just the most recent Google cases.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she was content to green light Google&#8217;s acquisition of wearable maker Fitbit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">at the end of last year</a> &#8212; despite a multitude of voices raised against allowing the tech giant to further entrench its dominance.</p>
<p>On that she argued defensively that concessions secured from Google would be sufficient to address concerns (such as a promise extracted from Google not to use Fitbit data for ads for at least 10 years).</p>
<p>But, given her record on monitoring Google&#8217;s compliance with a whole flush of EU antitrust rulings, it&#8217;s hard to see why anyone other than Google should be confident in the Commission&#8217;s ability or willingness to enforce its own mandates against Google. Complaints against how Google operates, meanwhile, just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/act-now-before-google-kills-us-135-strong-coalition-of-startups-warns-eu-antitrust-chief/">keep stacking up</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are listening,&#8221; says Kroll of the Commission. &#8220;But what I am missing is action.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish autonomous electric vehicle startup <a class="c-link" href="https://www.einride.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.einride.tech/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Einride</a> is aiming to continue the momentum sparked by partnerships with Oatly and Lidl by seeking additional capital, TechCrunch has learned.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-1917"> </span></p>
<p>Einride is seeking $75 million in new financing, while at the same time exploring the potential for a public listing through a special purpose acquisition company, according to people with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>SPACs, a mechanism in which a publicly traded shell company merges with a private business, have taken the U.S. capital markets by storm led, in part, by startups focused on the electrification of mobility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early successes of public listings for companies like Nikola (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nikolas-stock-crashes-after-announcing-cancelation-of-contract-with-republic-services-for-2500-garbage-trucks/">despite its dubious claims</a>) helped set the stage for the SPAC boom. Canoo, Fisker Inc, ChargePoint and Lordstown Motors are just a few of the U.S.-based EV companies that have gone public via a SPAC in the past year.</p>
<p>Unlike some newly minted SPAC companies, Einride has some fundamentals. The company has already piloted its technology <a href="https://www.einride.tech/press/oatly-reduces-carbon-footprint-first-month-einride-electric-trucks">through a partnership with Oatly</a>, the Swedish oat milk maker.</p>
<p>Oatly began using Einride’s electric trucks on its delivery routes from each of its Swedish production sites in October 2020. Thus far, the trucks have driven over 8,600 km electric and as a result have saved over 10,500 kg of CO2 compared to diesel, according to a statement from the companies.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is at the core of everything we do, and we work hard to lower our emissions across the board. This includes our emissions for transports, which is why we are now shifting to electrical vehicles, which reduces our climate footprint by 87% on these routes,” said Simon Broadbent, supply chain director at Oatly, in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>The deal with Oatly was just the beginning. As the ink dried on that partnership, Einride quickly signed other marquee Swedish businesses including the food shipping and logistics company Lidl and the electronics manufacturer Electrolux.</p>
<p>Big automakers have electric and autonomous plans of their own. Argo, a developer of self-driving technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/self-driving-startup-argo-ai-hits-7-5-billion-valuation/">is now worth $7.5 billion</a> thanks to an investment from Ford and the VW Group. And VW&#8217;s Traton Group is pushing low emission and electrification through a $2.2 billion investment <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-02/traton-to-pour-2-2-billion-into-electric-trucks-software">announced in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Daimler, Paccar, and Volvo<a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/18-companies-and-startups-that-are-leading-the-race-for-the-autonomous-trucks-4ba5a50e6dee"> all have plans</a> as well.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just scratching the surface of the money that&#8217;s pouring in to autonomous, electrified transport. Of course, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi">Tesla is in the game with its own semi truck</a> and, in China, Plus AI, is automating a number of vehicles from Manbang, Suning and FAW Jiefang.</p>
<p id="bc9a" class="is it ez iu b fy iv iw ix gb iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn dm fw" data-selectable-paragraph="">All of this money is aiming to capture a portion of the market for autonomous, electrified vehicles that the consulting firm McKinsey estimated would save the trucking industry over $100 billion. It&#8217;s a potentially huge opportunity in the $260 billion U.S. trucking market alone. Worldwide, businesses spend about $1.2 trillion on trucking, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/distraction-or-disruption-autonomous-trucks-gain-ground-in-us-logistics">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">The benefits that would accrue to the industry are more than just financial. Trucking is a huge component of the greenhouse gas emissions that come from the transportation sector &#8212; which includes road, rail, air and marine transportation. In 2016, trucking and transport broadly contributed to roughly 24% of the world&#8217;s total greenhouse gas emissions &#8212; and that number has been steadily increasing.</p>
<p>Any reduction in carbon emissions from the transport sector would be a huge step forward on the path toward a more environmentally sustainable future.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">No wonder venture investors are falling all over each other to invest in these companies. Einride counts EQT Ventures and NordicNinja VC, a fund backed by Panasonic, Honda, Omron and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, among its investors. Along with backing from Ericsson Ventures, Norrsken Foundation, Plum Alley Investments and Plug and Play Ventures the startup has raised $32 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before kids graduate to the expansive virtual worlds in games like Roblox, Minecraft and Fortnite, they often get their start in online social gaming with a game like <a href="https://www.animaljam.com/en">Animal Jam</a>. Here, kids learn to personalize their avatar, explore a world, chat with other players and trade items in a safe environment with parental controls. Today, the company behind this popular title, WildWorks, is launching a new game, <a href="https://fer.al/en">Fer.al</a>, which builds on Animal Jam&#8217;s legacy while catering to a slightly older crowd of Gen Z teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started talking about Fer.al, it was the idea of where do kids go when they age out of Animal Jam?,&#8221; explains Clark Stacey, co-founder and CEO of WildWorks. &#8220;Because there isn&#8217;t a transitional space between a completely walled garden like Animal Jam and … Instagram and the adult social networks and games that don&#8217;t have those same protections,&#8221; he continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we wanted to provide a place for these older kids to go where the walls are a little bit lower,&#8221; Stacey adds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new game is meant to cater to older kids &#8212; meaning young teens ages 13 to around 18 &#8212; who are now choosing their own games, have their own email address and don&#8217;t need parental permission to play. The guardrails on chat also won&#8217;t be as high on Fer.al as on Animal Jam and will focus more on preventing bullying and abuse than blocking words. Players will also be able to connect their online social accounts to their game accounts in the future.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122288" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122288" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122288" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Creature_Customize.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122288" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>With <a href="https://fer.al/en">Fer.al</a>, WildWorks is introducing another animal-centered title, but this time it&#8217;s moving into the fantasy realm. Players choose between bipedal humanoid creatures based on folklore and myth including a Kitsune, Senri, Dragon, Jackelope, Werewolf, Kirin or a Shinigami, with more to come in time.</p>
<p>The characters&#8217; style was inspired by Animal Jam fan art, Stacey says, where kids would create animal avatars that were sort of a mix between manga, Animal Jam&#8217;s style, and other, older animation styles.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, Fer.al players will also be able to personalize their character and change their appearance, design their personal space (this time, a &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; instead of a &#8220;den,&#8221;) discover a world where they can interact with other players, collect items and trade, and venture on quests. But the storyline has also evolved to reflect teens&#8217; interests, including their growing understanding of social media and the desire to grow an online fan base.</p>
<p>The larger narrative involves a reality show where two warring queens, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aradiafellqueen/?hl=en">Aradia</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/delilahlichqueen/?hl=en">Delilah</a> &#8212; each with their own Instagram account, naturally &#8212; are angling for control. The company isn&#8217;t offering a lot of details as to how this narrative plays out in the long term, but it will involve weekly and monthly contests as the game ramps up, in addition to the everyday missions and quests that are undertaken to gain ingredients to create new clothes or a new &#8220;glamour&#8221; (a rendering effect that goes around your character.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122287" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122287" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122287" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Roleplaying.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>Much like Animal Jam &#8212; or even other virtual worlds like some Roblox games &#8212; players are meant to engage in cooperative gameplay to advance. There will be tasks you can&#8217;t complete on your own, meaning you&#8217;ll need to interact and chat. You will also be able to join factions, initially driven by the two queens, as the game advances.</p>
<p>Another notable aspect to Fer.al is that it&#8217;s largely designed to cater to girl gamers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not intended to be to the exclusion of boys who are in this age range,&#8221; explains Stacey. &#8220;But we recognize the fact that, among the most engaged Animal Jam players, it&#8217;s about 80% girls. We&#8217;ve leaned into that pretty heavily in Animal Jam &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to feature a lot of female scientists and working with them on causes that promote girls in STEM. So we know a lot of the built-in audience is coming from that,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think the need that we recognized is that it&#8217;s not hard for adolescent boys to find online communities that jive with them. It&#8217;s pretty hard for girls to find the same thing. So, as we&#8217;re creating this community &#8212; everything from the rules to the visuals &#8212; we are very conscious of that. And the people that we&#8217;re going to and asking for what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t, is primarily girls,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122285" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122285" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122285" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_Craft_Trade.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122285" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>Building off the Animal Jam fan base has been an advantage for getting Fer.al off the ground. Today, Animal Jam has anywhere between 2.5 million to 4 million monthly active users out of a total of 135 million registered accounts. The gulf between the registered and active figures is indicative of how many kids have grown out of Animal Jam since its October 2010 launch. But Stacey admits the title has seen some decline since its peak usage, as well.</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s a lot of interest in what WildWorks does next, it seems.</p>
<p>Within a week of launching the Fer.al website, the game had 75,000 kids sign up to become beta testers. The testers were brought into the beta slowly, starting in April 2020, and initially on desktop only. Now, the beta version of the game sees daily actives in the low 10,000&#8217;s pre-launch. On the Apple App Store and Google Play, over 100,000 people have registered for the pre-release, as well.</p>
<p>Like Animal Jam, Fer.al will offer a freemium experience. But while Animal Jam generated nearly 80% of revenues through subscriptions, Fer.al will use a season pass model of monetization. Users buy the season &#8212; priced around $10 to $20 &#8212; via an in-app purchase, which will unlock unique items and experiences specific to that season. It expects to launch around seven seasons per year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122289" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122289" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122289" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Feral_SanctuaryDesign.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122289" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WildWorks</p></div></p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer seasons until later in the beta test, but Stacey says the conversion rate was at &#8220;the high end of our expectations so far on desktop.&#8221; If the mobile conversion rates remain as high as desktop, it will be in the range to start investing in user acquisition, he says. The company may also consider ads at a later date as well as merchandise, if all goes well.</p>
<p>Salt Lake City-headquartered WildWorks (formerly Smart Bomb Interactive) is majority owned by Signal Peak Ventures, which has invested $20+ million into the company over the years. The company shifted in 2008 to focus on its own IP, resulting in the launch of Animal Jam and other titles.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, WildWorks&#8217; revenue &#8212; largely from Animal Jam and another game, Tag with Ryan &#8212; has ranged between $20+ million to below $30 million. If Fer.al is able to successfully capture the Animal Jam graduates who are looking to move up to &#8220;older kid&#8221; gameplay, it could grow that revenue base by a sizable amount.</p>
<p>Fer.al is launching publicly today in all countries and will be available initially in English. It can be played on PC, Mac, iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee and Netflix VP of Inclusion Strategy for Product Wade Davis about the work that still needs to be done, the effects of California&#8217;s Proposition 22 and more.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On last summer&#8217;s racial justice uprising</h3>
<p>Last summer, after the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent collective consciousness around racial injustice in the U.S., many tech companies spoke out about racism and equality. Davis said he was happy to see more people speaking about those issues but also a bit frustrated that &#8220;it takes something like that for folks to get truly engaged.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>And inside of Netflix, one of the things that I was really intentional about is to tell our employees who are not Black, right, to not ask our employees how they feel but for them to be much more introspective of what it felt like for them, right, as a white person, or however they identify for them to do the introspection. Because that&#8217;s what it means to be an ally &#8212; to not put the labor on the group that is already feeling the impact and the oppression. And what we found was that many of our employees, for the first time had to wrestle with like, what it means to be white. What it means to be in a situation where you are seeing someone who looks like you take the life of someone who looks like me. So we really tried to switch the actual narrative and the conversation to not add more labor and trauma on our Black employees. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 1:10)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Lee said she was a bit skeptical at the time because we&#8217;ve seen this type of response before in light of the violent killings of Black people.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>And then within a few weeks you see that interest and that focus wane once more. So I was skeptical that the enthusiasm would continue and enthusiasm in a way to try to solve all of our racism problems in a short period of time. I was surprised that it did continue. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 3:31)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In her conversations with her counterparts at Uber, Lee said she wanted to make sure that the company didn&#8217;t make such a wide commitment that &#8220;those commitments became nothing more than virtue signaling at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I said to my leadership, if you really want to come out and make some bold statements about being anti-racist, I&#8217;m going to create almost a litmus test to make sure that you really understand what that means because I don&#8217;t want to go up as a company to say we&#8217;re going to be anti-racist and then do nothing about it because that just relives and rehashes the injustices that we&#8217;ve seen in the past. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:25)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So when Uber&#8217;s first post-anti-racism diversity report came out, and it showed Uber&#8217;s Black employee base declined, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/despite-focus-on-anti-racism-ubers-black-employee-base-has-decreased/">Lee said at the time that was not acceptable</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I think part of the commitments we made around being really anti-racist is transparency at all costs, even when we know that transparency could potentially make us look, not reflect as positively on us. So the question did go back, as you know, when we were putting together our diversity report is, &#8216;wow, these numbers are not where we want them to be. None of us are happy about it.&#8217; But in our commitment of being accountable, you know, we want the public to hold us accountable. We want to hold people accountable, we want to be accountable to our workforce, we&#8217;re going to be as transparent about why that decline in black employees happened and underrepresented people happened, what the cause was and what we are doing. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 6:11)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Netflix, despite having previously reported diversity numbers, only released its <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-inclusion-report-2021">first official diversity report this year</a>. That&#8217;s partly because the team has only been in place for the last three years, Davis said.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>So we&#8217;re still at the awareness building phase, like from a foundational standpoint, and we&#8217;re really trying to double down so that folks know why I&amp;D matters. Like, what it actually is, and how it impacts all of us. Because oftentimes, folks think of all of these isms and phobias as something that happens to other people. But if we can really make folks understand that there&#8217;s a cost to all these isms, and phobias to all of us individually, interpersonally, culturally and institutionally, then it makes it easier down the road when folks start to feel somewhat fatigued, right? Because there is always that fatigue factor. So we&#8217;re really trying to get ahead of that. And to have folks to think through like, what is in it for me, and what is in it for my colleagues. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:33)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<h3>Sharing the DEI load</h3>
<p>Too often does the work of DEI fall on just a handful of people. At Netflix, Davis said it&#8217;s important that there is a shared load, and that all of its leaders are able to speak to the importance of diversity at the company.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: </strong>And I would say our other largest goal is to make sure that all of our leaders can speak to the importance of AI and be more than just a talking point. So how do we build a model that&#8217;s a train the trainer model, where each of our leaders has a one to one inclusion coach, which requires them to have monthly sit-downs with their inclusion partner, where they go on a real intensive journey, so that they can understand how does their leadership style need to evolve and adapt and expand and flex to meet the needs of a larger set of individuals and not the historical ones who folks have engaged with? And we found that to put our leaders on the spot, so that when someone calls me to give a talk, I can say &#8216;No, our COO Greg Peters is just as competent and capable to sit on this panel about inclusion as I am.&#8217; And we feel that we&#8217;re modeling and signaling to our entire organization that this is not just a nice to have, but it&#8217;s part and parcel to your success as an employee, as a leader and to our success as an organization. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:26)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<h3>On Prop 22&#8217;s impact on people of color</h3>
<p>Prop 22 went into effect in California earlier this year after a contentious battle where one side, including Uber, Lyft and other tech companies, wanted workers to remain independent contractors and the other side wanted gig workers to be made employees and therefore entitled to more benefits. Prop 22&#8217;s passage was a win for Uber and its counterparts, which collectively spent north of $200 million on its campaign efforts.</p>
<p>Some have wondered how Uber can reconcile its commitment to anti-racism given that many gig workers are people of color. Lee, however, pushed back on that characterization.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>I would challenge some of those that believe that Prop 22 actually disproportionately hurts people of color. If you actually look at the way the civil rights organizations that came out in support of Prop 22, the NAACP of Northern California and Hawaii came out in support of Prop 22, most of the Hispanic civil rights organizations as well. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 24:59)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Prop 22, of course, was in response to the passage of AB 5, which set new standards of worker classification that were designed to make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: </strong>And you looked at the way those exceptions were being made to AB 5, you saw that the exceptions were disproportionately being made for those IC &#8212; you know, independent contractor roles that were predominantly represented by white workers. And they were all getting exceptions from AB 5. And then you look at the roles that were predominantly represented by people of color, especially underrepresented people of color, and those roles were not getting exceptions in AB 5. [&#8230;] For me, how I define racism isn&#8217;t based on intent but it&#8217;s based on impact. And when I see that kind of level of disparate, disproportionate impact, that&#8217;s when I think about, you know, what is racist or not. So I would challenge this notion that [Prop 22] actually disproportionately hurt people of color, especially given that we had civil rights organizations that said we support Prop 22. So, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything that really needs to be reconciled, from my perspective and from the organization&#8217;s perspective. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 24:59)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An under-the-radar Tesla subsidiary has been at work building a 100 MW energy storage project in Angleton, Texas, according to an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas, and other documents. Bloomberg was </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first to report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the documents and link a previously unknown subsidiary to Tesla. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambit Energy Storage LLC applied for an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas, the regulatory body charged with overseeing the state’s electric utilities, in June of last year. Gambit said in the application, viewed by TechCrunch, that it intends to provide wholesale electricity and grid-balancing services on the Energy Reliability Council of Texas grid. The project is located in Angleton, a town about 50 miles west of Galveston near the Gulf Coast. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The ERCOT board of directors fired its CEO and the chair of the PUCT resigned in the wake of the catastrophe, while legislators at the capital mull major changes to Texas power market operations.</span></p>
