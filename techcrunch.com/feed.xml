										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> represent the two most successful cloud companies in their respective categories. Over the last few years the two cloud giants have had an evolving partnership. Today they announced plans for a new set of integration capabilities to make it easier to share data and build applications that cross the two platforms.</p>
<p>Patrick Stokes, EVP and GM for Platform at Salesforce, points out that the companies have worked together in the past to provide features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-to-bring-amazon-connect-to-service-cloud/">like secure sharing</a> between the two services, but they were hearing from customers that they wanted to take it further and today&#8217;s announcement is the first step towards making that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The initial phases of the partnership] have really been massively successful. We&#8217;re learning a lot from each other and from our mutual customers about the types of things that they want to try to accomplish, both within the Salesforce portfolio of products, as well as all the Amazon products, so that the two solutions complement each other really nicely. And customers are asking us for more, and so we&#8217;re excited to enter into this next phase of our partnership,&#8221; Stokes explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added, &#8220;The goal really is to unify our platforms, so bring [together] all the power of the Amazon services with all of the power of the of the Salesforce platform.&#8221; These capabilities could be the next step in accomplishing that.</p>

<p>This involves a couple of new features the companies are working on to help developers on both the platform and application side of the equation. For starters that includes enabling developers to virtualize Amazon data inside Salesforce without having to do all the coding to make that happen manually.</p>
<p>&#8220;More specifically, we&#8217;re going to virtualize Amazon data within the Salesforce platform, so whether you&#8217;re working with an S3 bucket, Amazon RDS or whatever it is we&#8217;re going to make it so that that the data is virtualized and just appears just like it&#8217;s native data on the Salesforce platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, developers building applications on Amazon will be able to access Salesforce data and have it appear natively in Amazon. This involves providing connectors between the two systems to make the data flow smoothly without a lot of coding to make that happen.</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing event sharing capabilities, which makes it easier for both Amazon and Salesforce customers to build microservices-based applications that cross both platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can build microservices-oriented architecture that spans the services of Salesforce and Amazon platforms, again without having to write any code. To do that, [we&#8217;re developing] out of the box connectors so you can click and drag the events that you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies are also announcing plans to make it easier from an identity and access management perspective to access the platforms with a guided setup. Finally, the companies are working on applications to build Amazon Chime communications tooling into Service Cloud and other Salesforce services to build things like virtual call centers using AWS machine learning technology.</p>
<p>Amazon VP of Global Marketing Rachel Thorton says that having the two cloud giants work together in this way should make it easier for developers to create solutions that span the two platforms. &#8220;I just think it unlocks such possibilities for developers, and the faster and more innovative developers can be, it just unlocks opportunities for businesses, and creates better customer experiences,&#8221; Thornton said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce also has extensive partnerships with other cloud providers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/salesforce-announces-its-moving-marketing-cloud-to-microsoft-azure/">including Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/salesforce-deepens-data-sharing-partnership-with-google/">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>As is typically the case with Salesforce announcements, while all of these capabilities are being announced today, they are still in the development stage and won&#8217;t go into beta testing until later this year with GA expected sometime next year. The companies are expected to release more details about the partnership at Dreamforce and re:Invent, their respective customer conferences later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://frumtak.is/english/">Frumtak  Ventures</a>, one of the few VCs in Iceland, has raised its third fund, Frumtak III. The $57 million (ISK 7b, €48m) fund will focus on post-seed and Series A startups.  The firm says its typical ticket size will range from $1-5 million (€850k-4.2m).</p>
<p>Frumtak was a somewhat lesser-known European VC until it popped up on our radar as the backers behind the Controlant real-time supply chain monitoring startup, the technology from which was pictured beside Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, when he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/icelands-controlant-with-50m-backing-emerges-as-key-player-in-cold-chain-for-covid-19-vaccine/">held up a box containing the first-ever shipment</a> of the COVID-19 vaccine to the city. Controlant has been a key player in the global distribution cold chain associated with vaccines.</p>
<p>However, the fund has also backed digital banking solutions provider Meniga, digital therapeutics scaleup Sidekick Health, travel CRM and travel booking system provider Kaptio, live event and fan engagement data analytics company Activity Stream, and Data Market, which was acquired by Qlik in  2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Svana Gunnarsdottir, managing partner of Frumtak Ventures said: “We are proud of the accomplishments of our portfolio companies and their teams, as well as the investment decisions we made through our first two funds. We look forward to continuing our support of high-potential startups and brilliant founders with Frumtak III.  We are also grateful  for the confidence shown to us by our LP’s, many of whom have been with us since our first fund in 2009.”</p>
<p>Concurrently, Asthildur Otharsdottir has joined the firm as partner and Frumtak III’s lead investment manager.  Otharsdottir was previously Frumtak’s Chairman for 6 years and has been on the board of Marel and Icelandair Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freight technology startup, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freighthub">Forto</a>, which we most recently covered when it raised $50 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">late last year</a>, is upping the stakes.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $240 million in a round led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 to expand its trade shipments between China and Europe. Forto manages shipping containers from origin to destination. Softbank is also hedging its bets after investing in China&#8217;s Full Truck Alliance (YMM.N), which plans a $20 billion IPO.</p>
<p>That means Forto’s valuation close to $1.2 billion, after it’s raised a total of $360 million. Also participating in the round were new investors Citi Ventures and G Squared. Existing investors including Northzone, Cherry Ventures and Unbound also took part, Forto said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>German logistics startups are proliferating. Trucking specialist Sennder, a digital road freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/digital-road-freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-160m-series-plans-european-expansion/">raised</a> $160 million in Series D financing earlier this year.</p>
<p>Forto says it has 2,500 clients, including Home 24 and German supermarket chain Edeka, and ships up to 10,000 containers a year by sea, rail and air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.planetscale.com/">PlanetScale</a>, the company behind the open-source <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> database clustering system for MySQL that was first developed at YouTube, today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B funding round led by Insight Partners, with participation from a16z and SignalFire. With this, the company has now raised a total of $55 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/planetscale">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement comes only a few weeks after PlanetScale launched its new hosted database platform, also dubbed PlanetScale. The company had previously offered a hosted version of Vitess, but with this new service, it is going a step further and offering what it calls a &#8220;developer-first database&#8221; that abstracts away all of the infrastructures to ensure that developers won&#8217;t have to think about cloud zones, cluster sizes and other details.</p>
<p>Indeed, PlanetScale CEO and co-founder Jiten Vaidya was quite open about the limitations of this earlier product. &#8220;What we had built last year was pretty much hosted Vitess, which was no different than how a lot of cloud providers today give you databases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So none of this ease of use, none of this elegance, none of these state-of-the-art experiences that the developers want and expect today, we had built into our product.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But a few months ago, the company brought on former GitHub VP of Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isamlambert/">Sam Lambert</a> as its Chief Product Officer. Vaidya noted that Lambert brought a lot of developer empathy to PlanetScale and helped it launch this new product.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to you because they&#8217;re not database experts, but they have data, they have problems,&#8221; Lambert said. &#8220;And too many companies, especially in the database world, do not think about the daily lives of their users like we do. They don&#8217;t think about the complete journey of what the user is actually trying to do, which is to provide value to their customers. They&#8217;re just very impressed with themselves for storing and retrieving data. And it&#8217;s like, yep, we&#8217;ve been doing that. We&#8217;ve been doing that since the 60s. Can we do something else now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s users today include the likes of Slack, Figma, GitHub and Square, so it&#8217;s clearly delivering value to a lot of users. As Lambert noted, PlanetScale aims to offer them a product that is simple and easy to use. &#8220;Just because it is simple and easy to use, and beautiful, honestly &#8212; like just beautiful, well-designed tooling &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s inferior. It doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s missing anything. It means the others are missing the poetry and the additional elements of beauty that you can add to infrastructure products,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>PlanetScale plans to use the new funding to scale its team globally and accelerate the adoption of its platform. Insight Partners Managing Director Nikhil Sachdev will join the company&#8217;s board, with the firm&#8217;s Managing Director Praveen Akkiraju also joining as a board observer.</p>
<p>&#8220;PlanetScale is setting a new bar for simplicity, performance and scalability for cloud-based databases in the serverless era,&#8221; said Sachdev. &#8220;The developer experience for databases has been painful for too long. PlanetScale is breaking that chain, solving longstanding problems related to scalability and reliability in an extremely elegant, tasteful, and useful way.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lower.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Ohio-based home finance platform, announced today it has raised $100 million in a Series A funding round led by Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round is notable for a number of reasons. First off, it’s a large Series A even by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">today’s standards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The financing also marks the previously bootstrapped Lower’s first external round of funding in its seven-year history. Lower is also something that is kind of rare these days in the startup world: profitable. Silicon Valley-based Accel has a history of backing profitable, bootstrapped companies, having also led large Series A rounds for the likes of 1Password, Atlassian, Qualtrics, Webflow, Tenable and Galileo (which went on to be acquired by SoFi). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Galileo founder Clay Wilkes introduced the VC firm to Dan Snyder, Lower’s founder and CEO. The two companies have a few things in common besides being profitable: they were both bootstrapped for years before taking institutional capital and both have headquarters outside of Silicon Valley.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were immediately intrigued because Ohio-based Lower echoes both of these themes,” said Accel partner John Locke, who led the firm’s investment in Lower and is taking a seat on the company’s board as part of the investment. “Like Galileo, Lower will be one of the most successful bootstrapped fintech companies globally. The combination of a company built in a nontraditional region across the globe and a bootstrapped company reminds us of [other] companies we have partnered with for a large Series A.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There were other unnamed participants in the round, but Accel provided the &#8220;majority&#8221; of the investment, according to Lower.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyder co-founded Lower in 2014 with the goal of making the homebuying process simpler for consumers. The company launched with Homeside, its retail brand that Snyder describes as &#8220;a tech-leveraged retail mortgage bank&#8221; that works with realtors and builders, among others. In 2018, the company launched the website for Lower, its direct-to-consumer digital lending brand with the mission of making its platform a one-stop shop where consumers can go online to save for a home, obtain or refinance a mortgage and get insurance through its marketplace. This year, it launched the Lower mobile app with a savings account.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Lower has funded billions of dollars in loans and notched an impressive $300 million in revenue in 2020 after doubling revenue every year, according to Snyder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our history is maybe a little atypical of fintech companies today,” he told TechCrunch. “We’ve had a view going back to the start of the company that we wanted to run it profitably. That’s been one of our pillars, so that’s what we’ve done. Also, we all grew up in the mortgage industry, so we saw firsthand the size of the market, but also how broken it was, so we wanted to change it.”</span></p>
<p>In launching the direct-to-consumer digital lending brand, the company was working to make the homebuying process more &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">digital, transparent and easier for consumers to access,” Snyder said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the company didn’t want to lose the human touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We tried to design the app flow in a way where you can get as far along as you can in the application but if you want, at any point in time, to talk or chat with someone, we’re available,” Snyder added.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168949" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168949" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2168949" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="593" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lower-App-Dark-3.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168949" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lower</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower&#8217;s typical customer is the millennial and now Gen Z who’s aspiring to own their first home, according to Snyder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They might be thinking, &#8216;OK, I might be living in an apartment now, but in the next few years I’m going to meet someone and/or have a child and I want to unlock the investment that is a home,&#8217; &#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And we’ll help them on that journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower&#8217;s recently launched new app offers a deposit account it’s dubbed “HomeFund.” The interest-bearing FDIC-insured deposit account offers a 0.75% Annual Percentage Yield and is designed to help consumers save for a home with a &#8220;dollar-for-dollar match in rewards&#8221; up to the first $1,000 saved, Snyder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower works with more than 35 major insurance carriers nationally, including Nationwide, Liberty Mutual and Allstate. It has more than 1,600 employees, about half of which are based in Lower’s home state. That’s up from about 650 employees in June of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to add more services and has an “aggressive roadmap” for adding new features to its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, for example, Lower sells primarily to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while it services the majority of its loans, like many large lenders, it uses a subservicer. That will change, however, in early 2022, when Lower intends to launch its own native servicing platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the company intends to continue to run profitably, Snyder said he and his co-founders “think the time is now to gain share.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to become a global brand, raise money and gain market share,” he added. “We’re going to continue to double down on product and build out our capabilities. We are the best-kept secret in fintech and plan to change that with smart branding, advertising and sponsorships.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last but not least, Lower is eyeing the public markets as part of its longer-term roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, we know we can build a great public company,” Snyder told TechCrunch. “We’re of the scale to be a public company right now, but we’re going to keep our heads down and we’re going to keep building for the next few years and then I think we can be in a spot to be a strong public business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s Locke points out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that in the U.S., mortgage and home finance are among the largest financial service markets, and they have primarily been handled by large banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For most consumers, getting a mortgage through these banks continues to be an overly complex, slow-moving process,” Locke told TechCrunch. “We believe by providing consumers a great mobile experience, Lower will gain share from incumbent banks, in the same way that companies like Monzo have in banking or Venmo in payments or Trade Republic and Robinhood in stock trading.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Diversity and inclusion have become central topics in the world of work. In the best considerations, improving them is a holistic effort, involving not just conceiving of products with this in mind, but hiring and managing talent in a diverse and inclusive way, too. A new startup called <a href="https://www.getpequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pequity</a> that has built a product to help with the latter of these areas, specifically in equitable compensation, has now raised some funding &#8212; a sign of the demand in the market, as well as how tech is being harnessed in aid of helping it.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup has raised $19 million in a Series A led by Norwest Venture Partners. First Round Capital, Designer Fund, and Scribble Ventures also participated in the fundraise, which will be used to continue investing in product and also hiring: the company has 20 on its own books now and will aim to double that by the end of this year, on the heels of positive reception in the market.</p>
<p>Since launching officially last year, Pequity has picked up over 100 customers, with an initial focus on fast-scaling companies in its own backyard, a mark of how D&amp;I have come into focus in the tech industry in particular. Those using Pequity to compare and figure out compensation include Instacart, Scale.ai and ClearCo, and the company said that in the last four months, the platform&#8217;s been used to make more then 5,000 job offers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2169118" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169118" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2169118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="265" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg 2578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=768,679 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=1536,1357 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=2048,1810 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-IMG_9292.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.getpequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pequity <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Kaitlyn Knopp, the CEO who co-founded the company with Warren Lebovics (both pictured, right), came up for the idea for Pequity in much the same way that many innovations in the world of enterprise IT come to market: through her own first-hand experience.</p>
<p>She spent a decade working in employment compensation in the Bay Area, with previous roles at Google, Instacart, and Cruise. In that time, she found the tools that many companies used were lacking and simply &#8220;clunky&#8221; when it came to compensation analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way the market has worked so far is that platforms had compensation as an element but not the focus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was the end of the tagline, the final part of a &#8216;CRM for candidates.&#8217; But you still have to fill in all the gaps, you have to set the architecture the right way. And with compensation, you have to bake in your own analytics, which implies that you have to have some expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, as with other aspects of enterprise software, she added that the very biggest tech companies sometimes worked on their own tools, but not only does that leave smaller or otherwise other-focused businesses out of having better calculation tools, but it also means that those tools are siloed and miss out on being shaped by a bigger picture of the world of work. &#8220;We wanted to take that process and own it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pequity product essentially works by plugging into all of the other tools that an HR professional might be using &#8212; HRIS, ATS, and payroll products &#8212; to manage salaries across the whole of the organization in order to analyse and compare how compensation could look for existing and prospective employees. It combines a company&#8217;s own data and then compares it to data from the wider market, including typical industry ranges and market trends, to provide insights to HR teams.</p>
<p>All of this means that HR teams are able to make more informed decisions, which is step number one in being more transparent and equitable, but is also something that Pequity is optimized to cover specifically in how it measures compensation across a team.</p>
<p>And in line with that, there is another aspect of the compensation mindset that Knopp also wanted to address in a standalone product, and that is the idea of building a tool with a mission, one of providing a platform that can bring in data to make transparent and equitable decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the comp tools that I&#8217;ve interacted with are reactive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You may have to do, say, a pay equity test, you do your promotion and merit cycles, and then you find all these issues that you have to solve. We&#8217;re flagging those things proactively with our analytics, because we&#8217;re plugging into those systems, which will give you those alerts before the decisions need to be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an added step in that direction, Knopp said that ultimately she believes the tool should be something that those outside of HR, such as managers and emploiyees themselves, should be able to access to better understand the logic of their own compensation and have more information going into any kind of negotiation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be interesting to see whether modernized products like Pequity, which are tackling old problems with a new approach and point of view, find traction in the wider market. If one purpose in HR is to address diversity and inclusion, and part of the problem has been that the tools are just not fit for that purpose, then it seems a no-brainer that we&#8217;ll see more organizations trying out new things to see if they can help them in their own race to secure talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compensation reflects a company’s values, affects its ability to hire talent, and is the biggest expense on its P&amp;L. And yet, most comp teams run on spreadsheets and emails,” said Parker Barrile, Partner at Norwest, in a statement. “Pequity empowers comp teams to design and manage equitable compensation programs with modern software designed by comp professionals, for comp professionals.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the company behind the popular open-source Next.js React framework, today announced that it has raised a $102 million Series C funding round led by Bedrock Capital. Existing investors Accel, CRV,<br />
Geodesic Capital, Greenoaks Capital and GV also participated in this round, together with new investors 8VC, Flex Capital, GGV, Latacora, Salesforce Ventures and Tiger Global. In total, the company has now raised $163 million and its current valuation is $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>As Vercel notes, the company saw strong growth in recent months, with traffic to all sites and apps on its network doubling since October 2020. About half of the world&#8217;s largest 10,000 websites now use Next.js . Given the open-source nature of the Next.js framework, not all of these users are obviously Vercel customers, but its current paying customers include the likes of Carhartt, Github, IBM, McDonald’s and Uber.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168971" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168971" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2168971" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="276" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg 580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=300,276 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vercel_example.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vercel</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For us, it all starts with a front-end developer,&#8221; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch told me. &#8220;Our goal is to create and empower those developers &#8212; and their teams &#8212; to create delightful, immersive web experiences for their customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Vercel, Rauch and his team took the Next.js framework and then built a serverless platform that specifically caters to this framework and allows developers to focus on building their front ends without having to worry about scaling and performance.</p>
<p>Older solutions, Rauch argues, were built in isolation from the cloud platforms and serverless technologies, leaving it up to the developers to deploy and scale their solutions. And while some potential users may also be content with using a headless content management system, Rauch argues that increasingly, developers need to be able to build solutions that can go deeper than the off-the-shelf solutions that many businesses use today.</p>
<p>Rauch also noted that developers really like Vercel&#8217;s ability to generate a preview URL for a site&#8217;s front end every time a developer edits the code. &#8220;So instead of just spending all your time in code review, we&#8217;re shifting the equation to spending your time reviewing or experiencing your front end. That makes the experience a lot more collaborative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So now, designers, marketers, IT, CEOs [&#8230;] can now come together in this collaboration of building a front end and say, &#8216;that shade of blue is not the right shade of blue.'&#8221;</p>
<p>“Vercel is leading a market transition through which we are seeing the majority of value-add in web and cloud application development being delivered at the front end, closest to the user, where true experiences are made and enjoyed,” said Geoff Lewis, founder and managing partner at Bedrock. “We are extremely enthusiastic to work closely with Guillermo and the peerless team he has assembled to drive this revolution forward and are very pleased to have been able to co-lead this round.”</p>

<p>How big is that? Facebook&#8217;s MAUs stood at 2.85 billion as of March. TikTok was forecasted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/new-forecast-pegs-tiktok-to-top-1-2b-monthly-active-users-in-2021/">surpass 1.2 billion MAUs</a> this year, and its Chinese version Douyin said in September it had already amassed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bytedance-idINKBN2660P4">600 million daily users</a>. So there&#8217;s still room for Kuaishou to catch up.</p>
<p>China remains Kuaishou&#8217;s key market. Its overseas MAUs exceeded 100 million in the first quarter, during which it &#8220;moved forward with our strategy in South America and Southeast Asia,&#8221; and quickly jumped to 150 million MAUs by April, the firm noted on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4431737-kuaishou-technology-kuasf-ceo-su-hua-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">an earnings call</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listed in Hong Kong, Kuaishou&#8217;s stock climbed more than 6% to nearly HK$200 ($25.7) a share on Wednesday, lifting its market cap to about HK$830 billion ($107 billion), though the price is well below its peak at HK$415 in February.</p>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s advancement around the world is a reminder that ByteDance isn&#8217;t the only Chinese internet company making significant inroads into foreign markets. Bigo, owned by China&#8217;s Joy, was a hugely popular live video app in India before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">getting banned by the local government</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a pioneer since 2011, Kuaishou has provided internet users globally the opportunity to record and share their life stories,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s founder and CEO Su Hua said at a press conference Wednesday where he announced the app had earned the official broadcasting rights to air the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli cloud security startup Mitiga has raised $25 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/recent-funding/">a Series A round of funding</a> as it moves to “completely change” the traditional incident response market.</p>
<p>Mitiga, unlike other companies in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> space, isn’t looking to prevent cyberattacks, which the startup claims are inevitable no matter how much protection is in place. Rather, it&#8217;s looking to help organizations manage their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/incident-response/">incident response</a>, particularly as they transition to hybrid and multi-cloud environments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The early-stage startup, which raised $7 million in seed funding in July last year, says its incident readiness and response tech stack accelerates post-incident bounce back from days down to hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Its subscription-based offering automatically detects when a network is breached and quickly investigates, collects case data, and translates it into remediation steps for all relevant divisions within an organization so they can quickly and efficiently respond. Mitiga also documents each event, allowing organizations to fix the cause in order to prevent future attacks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mitiga’s Series A was led by ClearSky Security, Atlantic Bridge, and DNX, and the startup tells TechCrunch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that it will use the funds to “continue to disrupt how incident readiness and response is delivered,” as well as &#8220;significantly&#8221; increasing its cybersecurity, engineering, sales, and marketing staff.</p>
<p>The company added that the funding comes amid a “changing mindset” for enterprise organizations when it comes to incident readiness and response. The pandemic has accelerated cloud adoption, and it’s predicted that spending on cloud services will surpass $332 billion this year alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This acceleration, naturally, has provided a lucrative target for hackers, with cyberattacks on cloud services increasing 630% in the first four months of 2020, according to McAfee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The cloud represents new challenges for incident readiness and response and we’re bringing the industry’s first incident response solution in the cloud, for the cloud,” said Tal Mozes, co-founder and CEO of Mitiga.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“This funding will allow us to further our engagements with heads of enterprise security who are looking to recover from an incident in real-time, attract even more of the most innovative cybersecurity minds in the industry, and expand our partner network. I couldn’t be more excited about what Mitiga is going to do for cloud-first organizations who understand the importance of cybersecurity readiness and response.”</p>
<p>Mitiga was founded in 2019 by Mozes, Ariel Parnes and Ofer Maor, and the team of 42 currently works in Tel Aviv with offices in London and New York. It has customers in multiple sectors, including financial service institutions, banks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/e-commerce/">e-commerce</a>, law enforcement and government agencies, and Mitiga also provides emergency response to active network security incidents such as ransomware and data breaches for non-subscription customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/new-report-details-threats-to-consumers-from-surveillance-based-advertising/">international coalition</a> of consumer protection, digital and civil rights organizations and data protection experts has added its voice to growing calls for a ban on what&#8217;s been billed as &#8220;surveillance-based advertising&#8221;.</p>
<p>The objection is to a form of digital advertising that relies upon a massive apparatus of background data processing which sucks in information about individuals, as they browse and use services, to create profiles which are used to determine which ads to serve (via multi-participant processes like the high speed auctions known as real-time bidding).</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">previously called for a ban on targeted advertising which relies upon pervasive tracking</a> &#8212; warning over a multitude of associated rights risks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">Last fall</a> the EU parliament also urged tighter rules on behavioral ads.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/us-privacy-consumer-competition-and-civil-rights-groups-urge-ban-on-surveillance-advertising/">Back in March</a>, a US coalition of privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups also took collective aim at microtargeting. So pressure is growing on lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic to tackle exploitative adtech as consensus builds over the damage associated with mass surveillance-based manipulation.</p>
<p>At the same time,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/"> momentum is clearly building</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/">pro-privacy</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">consumer tech</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/braves-non-tracking-search-engine-is-now-in-beta/">services</a> &#8212; showing the rising store being placed by users and innovators on business models that respect people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>The growing uptake of such services underlines how alternative, rights-respecting digital business models are not only possible (and accessible, with many freemium offerings) but increasingly popular.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2021-06-22-letter-to-policymakers-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">open letter</a> addressing EU and US policymakers, the international coalition &#8212; which is comprised of 55 organizations and more than 20 experts including groups like Privacy International, the Open Rights Group, the Center for Digital Democracy, the New Economics Foundation, Beuc, Edri and Fairplay &#8212; urges legislative action, calling for a ban on ads that rely on &#8220;systematic commercial surveillance&#8221; of Internet users in order to serve what Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg likes, euphemistically, to refer to as &#8216;relevant ads&#8217;.</p>
<p>The problem with Zuckerberg&#8217;s (self-serving) framing is that, as the coalition points out, the vast majority of consumers don&#8217;t actually want to be spied upon to be served with these creepy ads.</p>
<p>Any claimed &#8216;relevance&#8217; is irrelevant to consumers who experience ad-stalking as creepy and unpleasant. (And just imagine how the average Internet user would feel if they could peek behind the adtech curtain &#8212; and see the vast databases where people are profiled at scale so their attention can be sliced and diced for commercial interests and sold to the highest bidder).</p>
<p>The coalition points to a <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/consumer-attitudes-to-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">report </a>examining consumer attitudes to surveillance-based advertising, prepared by one of the letter&#8217;s signatories (the Norwegian Consumer Council; NCC), which found that only one in ten people are positive about commercial actors collecting information about them online &#8212; and only one in five think ads based on personal information are okay.</p>

<p>Neither do we at <a href="https://twitter.com/edri?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@edri</a>, which is why we join over 50 orgs &amp; 20 academics &amp; experts for a transatlantic call to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BanSurveillanceAdvertising?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BanSurveillanceAdvertising</a>.<a href="https://t.co/bTCdZIsSuP">https://t.co/bTCdZIsSuP</a> <a href="https://t.co/3rtDjAMIxA">pic.twitter.com/3rtDjAMIxA</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A full third of respondents to the survey were &#8220;very negative&#8221; about microtargeted ads &#8212; while almost half think advertisers should not be able to target ads based on any form of personal information.</p>
<p>The report also highlights a sense of impotence among consumers when they go online, with six out of ten respondents feeling that they have no choice but to give up information about themselves.</p>
<p>That finding should be particularly concerning for EU policymakers as the bloc&#8217;s data protection framework is supposed to provide citizens with a suite of rights related to their personal data that should protect them against being strong-armed to hand over info &#8212; including stipulating that if a data controller intends to rely on user consent to process data then consent must be informed, specific and freely given; it can&#8217;t be stolen, strong-armed or sneaked through using dark patterns. (Although that remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">all too often the case</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Forced consent is not legal under EU law &#8212; yet, per the NCC&#8217;s European survey, a majority of respondents feel they have no choice but to be creeped on when they use the Internet.</p>
<p>That in turn points to an ongoing EU enforcement failure over major adtech-related complaints, scores of which have been filed in recent years under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">some of which are now over three years old</a> (yet still haven&#8217;t resulted in any action against rule-breakers).</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">EU lawmakers have acknowledged problems with patchy GDPR enforcement</a> &#8212; and it&#8217;s interesting to note that the Commission suggested some alternative enforcement structures in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">recent digital regulation proposals</a>, such as for oversight of very large online platforms in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA).</p>
<p>In the letter, the coalition suggests the DSA as the ideal legislative vehicle to contain a ban on surveillance-based ads.</p>
<p>Negotiations to shape a final proposal which EU institutions will need to vote on remain ongoing &#8212; but it&#8217;s possible the EU parliament could pick up the baton to push for a ban on surveillance ads. It has the power to amend the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals and its approval is needed for draft laws to be adopted. So there&#8217;s plenty still to play for.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the US, we urge legislators to enact comprehensive privacy legislation,&#8221; the coalition adds.</p>

<p>The coalition is backing up its call for a ban on surveillance-based advertising with another <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/report-time-to-ban-surveillance-based-advertising.pdf">report</a> (also by the NCC) which lays out the case against microtargeting &#8212; summarizing the raft of concerns that have come to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">attached to manipulative ads</a> as awareness of the adtech industry&#8217;s vast, background people-profiling and data trading has grown.</p>
<p>Listed concerns not only focus on how privacy-stripping practices are horrible for individual consumers (enabling the manipulation, discrimination and exploitation of individuals and vulnerable groups) but also flag the damage to digital competition as a result of adtech platforms and data brokers intermediating and cannibalizing publishers&#8217; revenues &#8212; eroding, for example, the ability of professional journalism to sustain itself and creating the conditions where ad fraud has been able to flourish.</p>
<p>Another contention is that the overall health of democratic societies is put at risk by surveillance-based advertising &#8212; as the apparatus and incentives fuel the amplification of misinformation and create security risks, and even national security risks. (Strong and independent journalism is also, of course, a core plank of a healthy democracy.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This harms consumers and businesses, and can undermine the cornerstones of democracy,&#8221; the coalition warns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to &#8216;show the right ad to the right people&#8217;,&#8221; the letter goes on. &#8220;Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and cases have shown that such alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no fair trade-off in the current surveillance-based advertising system. We encourage you to take a stand and consider a ban of surveillance-based advertising as part of the Digital Services Act in the EU, and the for U.S. to enact a long overdue federal privacy law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hence Facebook&#8217;s claimed &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/05/facebook-is-pivoting/">pivot to privacy</a>&#8216;; its plan to lock in its first party data advantage (by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/02/facebook-warned-over-privacy-risks-of-merging-messaging-platforms/">merging the infrastructure of different messaging products</a>); and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/">keen interest in crypto</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why Google has been working on a stack of alternative adtech that it wants to replace third party tracking cookies. Although its proposed replacement &#8212; the so-called &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a>&#8216; &#8212; would still enable groups of Internet users to be opaquely clustered by its algorithms in &#8216;interest&#8217; buckets for ad targeting purposes which still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">doesn&#8217;t look great for Internet users&#8217; rights either</a>. (And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">concerns have been raised on the competition front too</a>.)</p>
<p>Where its &#8216;Sandbox&#8217; proposal is concerned, Google may well be factoring in the possibility of legislation that outlaws &#8212; or, at least, more tightly controls &#8212; microtargeting. And it&#8217;s therefore trying to race ahead with developing alternative adtech that would have much the same targeting potency (maintaining its market power) but, by swapping out individuals for cohorts of web users, could potentially sidestep a ban on &#8216;microtargeting&#8217; technicalities.</p>
<p>Legislators addressing this issue will therefore need to be smart in how they draft any laws intended to tackle the damage caused by surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>Certainly they will if they want to prevent the same old small- and large-scale manipulation abuses from being perpetuated.</p>
<p>The NCC&#8217;s report points to what it dubs as &#8220;good alternatives&#8221; for digital advertising models which don&#8217;t depend on the systematic surveillance of consumers to function. And which &#8212; it also argues &#8212; provide advertisers and publishers with &#8220;more oversight and control over where ads are displayed and which ads are being shown&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem of ad fraud is certainly massively underreported. But, well, it&#8217;s instructive to recall how often Facebook has had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-for-years-ad-reach-estimates-were-based-on-wrong-data-but-blocked-fixes-over-revenue-impact-per-court-filing/">&#8216;fess up to problems with self reported ad metrics</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible to sell advertising space without basing it on intimate details about consumers. Solutions already exist to show ads in relevant contexts, or where consumers self-report what ads they want to see,&#8221; the NCC&#8217;s director of digital policy, Finn Myrstad, noted in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ban on surveillance-based advertising would also pave the way for a more transparent advertising marketplace, diminishing the need to share large parts of ad revenue with third parties such as data brokers. A level playing field would contribute to giving advertisers and content providers more control, and keep a larger share of the revenue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian early stage venture firm <a href="https://www.golden.ventures">Golden Ventures</a> has raised its fourth fund, a $100 million pool of capital that it will use to invest in between 20 to 25 companies, as well as a $20 million &#8216;Opportunities Fund&#8217; that it will use to make follow-on investments in standout performers among its portfolio. This is also the 10th anniversary for Golden Ventures, and its latest fund arrives at a time when the Canadian startup ecosystem looks healthier than ever, with a proliferation of angels emerging from past success stories, a number of new funds being announced, and unicorn valuations on significant funding rounds for multiple Canadian startups.</p>
<p>I spoke to Golden Ventures Founder and Managing Partner Matt Golden, and General Partner Ameet Shah about its plans for this fund, and about the Canadian startup and investment landscape in general.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time, we&#8217;re certainly seeing more and more interest in institutional LPs, more and more interest in the Canadian ecosystem, which I think is a net positive,&#8221; Golden said. &#8220;Whereas before, the Canadian ecosystem was largely funded by Canadian institutions, so I think that&#8217;s really positive, because you have to sort of be judged on the on the world stage. And we&#8217;re starting to meet that bar as both an ecosystem and as a fund.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Golden said that the game plan with this Fund IV doesn&#8217;t really change in terms of their investment targets; while Golden initially set out to invest primarily in companies working on software products for mobile devices, it eventually shifted to a strategy of backing North American seed stage, mission-driven founders working on venture-scale opportunities across a range of verticals and categories.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that over time, our ratio of deals, Canada to U.S., we&#8217;ve increased the number of deals on a ratio basis that we do in Canada versus the U.S., just by virtue of the fact that the Canadian ecosystem is on a terrific, high-velocity trajectory.&#8221; Golden said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen it coming, but I think it&#8217;s really starting to hit its stride now, with lots of founders with &#8216;big swing&#8217; vision, and an increasing interest in capital playing in the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shah added that he also thinks we&#8217;re trending towards more startups that originate in Canada setting up nodes in different geographies in ways that make most sense for their talent needs, and vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Post-COVID, a lot of companies may start here, but with the geographical boundaries just blurring, there&#8217;s really no reason they can&#8217;t set up locations in different centers of gravity and take advantage of other ecosystems&#8217; competitive advantages,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had one that recently set up a location in LA, as well as Toronto, capturing some the value of LA but also leveraging all the talent in Toronto as well. I think you&#8217;re gonna start seeing more and more of that, where things are moving more towards networks, and not just cities in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for this fund raise, it&#8217;s one of three recent Canadian early stage pools of venture capital to also include an &#8216;Opportunities Fund,&#8217; which in each case has been described as a way for the firms to participate in later stage deals in their star portfolio companies that they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be set up to invest in as an early stage investment organization. Golden Ventures is also introducing another new type of investment to its roster with Fund IV, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this concept, we call it &#8216;Angel allocation,&#8217; [&#8230;] it&#8217;s the idea that we can invest smaller checks, sort of 400-to-500 thousand, into companies where maybe the structure of the opportunity or of the deal may not fit what our core checks would be,&#8221; Golden explains. &#8220;That could be, for example, a case where there&#8217;s not enough room left in the round, or the valuation is outside of our core range, or maybe we&#8217;re learning about a completely new space that&#8217;s highly experimental — but we still have a high degree of conviction in the opportunity, in the people behind that opportunity, and the returns that it could generate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funds for those investments will come out of the main Fund IV pool, but the majority will still be targeting those core 20-25 larger checks. Overall, though, both Golden and Shah emphasize that the primary goal of the fund at this stage is capitalizing on the growing trend they see of more opportunity emerging in the Canadian ecosystem, and the impact that&#8217;s having in terms of startups across North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you talk about who are the the top five to ten companies in Canada, for a long time, it was really the same group,&#8221; Shah said. &#8220;Now, you&#8217;ve got this new crop of people that have come in and feel like they&#8217;re still on an upward trajectory, and I think that&#8217;s just really exciting as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aircall.io">Aircall</a> has raised a $120 million Series D round led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Following today’s funding round, the company has reached unicorn status, which means it has a valuation above $1 billion — this is the 16th French unicorn.</p>
<p>The startup has been building a cloud-based phone system for call centers, support lines and sales teams. It integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Slack, Intercom and other popular CRM, support and communication systems.</p>
<p>Aircall customers can create local numbers and set up an interactive voice response directory. The service manages the call queue for you and your agents can start answering inbound calls. Agents can transfer calls and put customers on hold. Admins can see analytics, monitor calls and see how everyone is doing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to Goldman Sachs Asset Management, existing investors DTCP, eFounders, Draper Esprit, Adam Street Partners, NextWorldCap and Gaia are also participating once again in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>As a cloud-based software product, Aircall works well with remote or hybrid teams. For the past year, many companies have been looking for a new phone system with various lockdowns taking place around the world. And Aircall has capitalized on this influx of customers.</p>
<p>When it comes to metrics, it means that signups increased by 65% in 2020. New customers include Caudalie, OpenClassrooms and Too Good To Go. Overall, Aircall has 8,500 customers. 15% of them are based in France, 35% in the U.S. and 50% in other countries.</p>
<p>With the new funding round, the company plans to iterate on its product with new integrations with third-party tools, and in particular industry-specific integrations. There will be new offices in London and Berlin as well as new hires in the company’s existing offices based in New York, Paris, Sydney and Madrid.</p>
<p>The company also plans to control a bigger chunk of its tech stack. It means that it’ll collaborate with big telecommunications companies to leverage their networks. You can also expect more product features with better transcription and better sentiment analysis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to keep up with the fundraising spree in China&#8217;s autonomous driving industry these days. Guangzhou- and California-based robotaxi company WeRide, which counts Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance as one of its strategic investors, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">raised over $600 million in just under five months</a> from its Series B and C financing rounds.</p>
<p>The four-year-old upstart said in May that its valuation leaped to $3.3 billion in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">Series C fundraising</a>. WeRide has kept details of the backing to itself until today when it disclosed the investment was a lofty sum of $310 million from Alliance Ventures, a strategic venture capital fund operated by Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, China Structural Reform Fund, a Chinese state-owned private equity fund, and Pro Capital, which manages China&#8217;s CDB Equipment Manufacturing Funds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much WeRide has raised since its inception as some of its investments were undisclosed. It pulled in &#8220;<a href="https://www.weride.ai/series-a-update/">tens of millions of dollars</a>&#8221; from a Series A round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the second time Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi has shelled out money for WeRide following its initial strategic investment back in 2018. The follow-on funding came as the two companies strengthen ties to develop Level 4 driving vehicles for the Chinese market. Electric cars from the Dongfeng-Nissan joint venture, automated by WeRide software, have been providing robotaxi service in Guangzhou for 18 months. WeRide uses Nissan vehicles in California for research and development.</p>
<p>Ashwani Gupta, COO of Nissan, gave an assuring statement about the partnership: &#8220;As China stands at the forefront of helping define the future of mobility, we are delighted to partner with WeRide to bring even more innovative technologies and services to enrich people’s lives in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>WeRide similarly sounded rosy about the alliance with Nissan. &#8220;Throughout the past three years, they have been playing a critical role in supporting WeRide’s autonomous driving platform, hence, enabling us to establish a leading fleet of robotaxis,&#8221; said Tony Han, WeRide founder and CEO .</p>
<p>&#8220;With the continued support of Nissan, we will accelerate the commercial use of our driverless robotaxis in China.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyride, a Toronto-based company that provides white label apps, back-end analytics and multi-modal fleet management for shared micromobility startups, has raised $3.7 million — seed money that it says will help it reach a greater number of small, local operators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which operates in more than 160 markets in every continent besides Antarctica, has primarily been able to generate enough revenue to support its business since its founding in 2014. With the fresh capital, Joyride will double down on its ability to help local operators find and finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right vehicles, access insurance programs from trusted partners and learn how to deploy a profitable fleet. Joyride has already offered these services to an extent alongside its SaaS business model, but wants to feature them more prominently as its business grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really early on in the pandemic, we saw companies like Bird and Lime pull out of almost every market they were in, and then almost right away we started to get a lot of local entrepreneurs from those cities contacting us and saying, ‘Hey, Bird and Lime just left. I see a real opportunity here for me to run a micromobility business for myself,’” Joyride’s founder and CEO Vince Cifani told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year, Joyride has seen interest from entrepreneurs looking to start small scooter and e-bike share businesses increase four-fold compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Cifani said. That looks like about 150 requests per week. Joyride’s stats point to an emerging trend of local operators beginning to spring up in the parts of the world perhaps deemed too small fry for the big operators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last couple of years, the industry seems to have been on the consolidation path, especially when we look at acquisitions like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Lime buying Jump</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224164/lime-buys-boosted-electric-skateboard-scooter-acquistion-bankrupt">Boosted</a> and Bird buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">Circ</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-scoot/">Scoot</a>. But we haven’t really seen consolidation among the hundreds of smaller businesses operating locally, said Cifani. And while they may be small individually, they’re mighty in numbers, quietly cropping up in towns and cities across the globe and privately at hotels and on campuses. In some cases, like with The Hague in the Netherlands, fleets are being operated by public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As local operators proliferate, the opportunity for companies like Joyride grows. In Germany, a similar software provider </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wunder Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently launched a lending division to help micromobility startups finance fleets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve identified that there are over 10,000 different markets for these types of local operators to run this type of business,” said Cifani. “So if it’s taken Bird, say, half a billion dollars to get into 100 plus markets, are they actually going to raise $100 billion to try and get into every single market opportunity in the world? The inflection point for us is that there’s a huge opportunity for this long tail market, and we’ve seen Bird try to pivot into that space as well with its fleet manager model.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Bird’s fleet manager model, which made up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">94% of the company&#8217;s &#8220;sharing&#8221; revenue in the second half of 2020</a>, the vehicles and software are supplied to local operators. Bird always maintains ownership and branding of the scooters. The fleet managers are responsible for</span> fleet deployment and rebalancing, sanitization, and general care and maintenance of the Bird vehicles. In exchange, the operators receive a portion of the fee that users pay to rent the scooters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joyride is different. The company helps customers buy fleets outright from manufacturing partners and in some cases helps them finance their vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where the big players like Bird and Lime have chased scale in the push to become profitable, Cifani says many of Joyride’s operators running smaller operations tell him they’ve paid back the money for all their vehicles within a few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyride’s seed round was led by Proeza Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund and Craig Miller, former CPO of Shopify, a platform that has similarly helped democratize the e-commerce space. Cifani says Joyride will be doing a Series A in the near future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sohail Prasad and Samvit Ramadurgam are cofounders who met during Y Combinator&#8217;s 2012 summer batch and went on to cofound <a href="https://forgeglobal.com/">Forge</a>, which helps accredited investors and institutions buy and sell private company shares and which most recently raised <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/04/forge-pre-ipo-giants-are-surging-this-company-is-reaping-the-rewards.html">$150 million</a> in new funding in May.</p>
<p>Forge &#8212; originally known as Equidate &#8212;  has taken off as demand for private company shares has ballooned. The company, launched in 2014, has now raised $250 million altogether, including from, Deutsche Börse, Temasek, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and Munich Re. It acquired rival SharesPost last year for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/once-rivals-secondary-market-player-forge-is-acquiring-sharespost-in-a-160-million-cash-and-stock-deal/">$160 million</a> in cash and stock. According to the company, it now has more than $14 billion in assets under custody.</p>
<p>Prasad and Ramadurgam &#8212; who helped hire Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques back in 2018 &#8212; say they&#8217;re excited about that success. They still own a stake in the company; they remain non-voting board members.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But after spending 18 months as co-president of Forge at the outset of Rodrigues&#8217;s tenure, they left early last year to begin tinkering on a new idea, one that Prasad says is centered around giving a much wider pool of people access to private company shares. Called <a href="https://destiny.xyz/">D/XYZ</a> (pronounced “Destiny”), the idea is to enable any investor &#8212; not just the 1% &#8212;  to invest in startups whose services they use and love.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rs72WP5474"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/once-rivals-secondary-market-player-forge-is-acquiring-sharespost-in-a-160-million-cash-and-stock-deal/">Once rivals, secondary market player Forge is acquiring SharesPost in a $160 million cash-and-stock deal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Once rivals, secondary market player Forge is acquiring SharesPost in a $160 million cash-and-stock deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/once-rivals-secondary-market-player-forge-is-acquiring-sharespost-in-a-160-million-cash-and-stock-deal/embed/#?secret=rs72WP5474" data-secret="rs72WP5474" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the two aren&#8217;t offering much more of a curtain raiser than that right now, though Prasad suggests D/XYZ is neither a new fund nor a crowdfunding vehicle. It&#8217;s also not selling any tokens, we gather. Instead, Prasad hints at an entirely new product, saying the company is being cautious in how much it shares publicly because it first wants to &#8220;get the go-ahead from regulators, as well as to ensure we have a clear path to market,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the two have raised $5 million in seed funding from numerous founders who like the idea of making private company shares easier for their parents, friends, customers, partners, and everyone else who likes what they&#8217;re building. Among the round&#8217;s participants is Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam; Plaid cofounder and CEO Zach Perret; Quora and Expo cofounder Charlie Cheever; Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra; and serial entrepreneur Siqi Chen, who most recently founded a finance software company called Runway.</p>
<p>As for some of the nascent startup&#8217;s most obvious competition, Prasad doesn&#8217;t sound concerned. Asked, for example, about Carta, a well-funded company that helps private companies and their employees manage and sell their stock and options and that has long talked about democratizing access to private company shares, Prasad says it remains very much a direct competitor instead to Forge given that both cater first and foremost to companies, not individuals.</p>

<p>And what of SPACs, the special purpose acquisition companies that are moving private companies onto the public market faster, allowing (at least in theory) more people to access high-growth companies at earlier stages? It&#8217;s a partial solution, says Prasad. But the way he sees it, &#8220;SPACs are more a reflection that people want late-stage access to private tech and their best option right now is giving money to a SPAC manager who will hopefully find a promising company to merge with in two years or less.&#8221; He calls them a &#8220;layer of abstraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also the question of whether Forge will be a friend of foe if whatever Prasad and Ramadurgam are building succeeds. Could their tech be sold back to their first company? Could Forge come to see them as a rival to its business?</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing now is not competitive,&#8221; insists Prasad. &#8220;It&#8217;s more picking up the mantle where we left off. Forge is focused on trading, custody, company solutions and data. It has built what some call boring plumbing.&#8221; Now that the plumbing has been erected, it has &#8220;enabled a lot of other interesting things to be built, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So is D/XYZ working with Forge in some capacity? Prasad demurs. &#8220;Potentially,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>In other words, stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of Holy Grail, a two-year-old startup based in Mountain View, California, are taking a micro approach to solving the outsized problem of capturing carbon.</p>
<p>The startup is prototyping a direct air carbon capture device that is modular and small — a departure from the dozens of projects in the U.S. and abroad that aim to capture CO2 from large, centralized emitters, like power plants or industrial facilities. Holy Grail co-founder Nuno Pereira told TechCrunch that this approach will reduce costs and eliminate the need for permits or project financing.</p>
<p>While Holy Grail has a long development and testing phase ahead, the idea has captured the attention and capital from well-known investors and Silicon Valley founders. Holy Grail recently raised $2.7 million in seed funding from LowerCarbon Capital, Goat Capital, Stripe founder Patrick Collison, Charlie Songhurst, Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, Songkick co-founder Ian Hogarth, Starlight Ventures and 35 Ventures. Existing investors Deep Science Ventures, Y Combinator and Oliver Cameron, who co-founded Voyage, the autonomous vehicle acquired by Cruise, also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The carbon capture device is still in the prototype stage, Pereira said, with many specifics &#8212; such as the anticipated size of the end product and how long it will likely function &#8212; still to be worked out. Cost-effectively separating CO2 from the air is an extremely difficult problem to solve. The company is in the process of filing patents for the technology, so he declined to be too specific about many characteristics of the device, including what it will be made out of. But he did stress that the company is taking a fundamentally different technical approach to carbon capture.</p>
<p>“The current technologies, they are very complex. They are basically either [using] temperature or pressure [to capture carbon],” he said. “There is a lot of things that go into it, compressors, calciners and all these things,” referring to additional parts like mechanical pumps, cryogenic air separators and large quantities of water and energy. Pereira said the company will instead use electricity to control a chemical reaction that binds to the CO2. He added that Holy Grail’s devices are not dependent on scale to achieve cost reductions, either. And they will be modular, so they can be stacked or configured depending on a customer’s requirements.</p>
<p>The scrubbers, as Pereira calls them, will focus on raw capture of CO2 rather than conversion (converting the CO2 into fuels, for example). Pereira instead explained &#8212; with a heavy caveat that much about the end product still needs to be figured out &#8212; that once a Holy Grail unit is full, it could be collected by the company, though where the carbon will end up is still an open question.</p>
<p>The company will start by selling carbon credits, using its devices as the carbon reducing project. The end goal is selling the scrubbers to commercial customers and eventually even individual consumers. That’s right: Holy Grail wants you to have your own carbon capture device, possibly even right in your backyard. But the company still likely has a long road ahead of it.</p>
<p>“We’re essentially shifting the scaling factor from building a very large mega-ton plant and having the project management and all that stuff to building scrubbers in an assembly line, like a consumer product to be manufactured.”</p>
<p>Pereira said many approaches will be needed to tackle the mammoth problem of reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. “The problem is just too big,” he said.</p>
<p><em>The story has been updated to reflect that Holy Grail is based in Mountain View, not Cupertino.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Usually, a teacher who grades students on a curve is boosting the efforts of those who didn’t perform well on the test. In the case of cloud companies, however, it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>As of Q1 2021, startups in this sector have median Series A rounds around $8 million, reports PitchBook. With $100+ million Series D rounds becoming more common, company valuations are regularly boosted into the billions.</p>
<p>Andy Stinnes, a general partner at Cloud Apps Capital Partners, says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/seed-is-not-the-new-series-a/">founders who are between angel and Series A</a> should seek out investors who are satisfied with $200,000 to $500,000 in ARR.</p>

<p>“In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has disclosed positive EBITDA — an adjusted profitability metric — many neobanks that we’ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability,” he writes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Google search is not what it used to be,&#8221; Ryan Sammy, the director of strategy at growth-marketing agency Fractl, writes in a guest post. &#8220;We all want to be No. 1 on the search results page, but these days, getting to that position isn&#8217;t enough. It might be worth your while to instead go after the top featured snippet position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sammy writes that earning the featured snippet spot is &#8220;one of the best things you can do for your SEO.&#8221; But how do you land your page in the coveted snippet perch?</p>

<p>After noSQL provider Couchbase filed to go public, joining the ranks of the Great IPO Rush of 2021, Alex Wilhelm looked into its business model and financial performance, with a goal of better understanding the company &#8212; and market comps.</p>
<p>Alex used Red Hat, which recently sold to IBM for around $34 billion, as a comp, determining Couchbase “is worth around $900 million” if you use the Red Hat math.</p>
<p>“The Red Hat-Couchbase comparison is not perfect; 2019 is ages ago in technology time, the database company is smaller and other differences exist between the two companies,” Alex notes. “But Red Hat does allow us the confidence to state that Couchbase will be able to best its final private valuation in its public debut.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim had been hearing that Series A raises were coming later, while Series Bs were coming in quick succession after startups landed an A.</p>
<p>That piqued their curiosity, so they put feelers out to a bunch of investors to understand what&#8217;s going on in early-stage venture capital markets.</p>
<p>In the first of a two-part series, Alex and Anna examine why seed stage is so chaotic, why As are slow, and why Bs are fast. In their first dispatch, they looked at the U.S. market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 22, 2021. We have startup product news, funding rounds and a roster of Big Tech updates for you today. But before we get into all of that do not forget to sign up for <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">TechCrunch Spotlight: Pittsburgh startup</a> Pitch-Off. Also the Equity podcast crew are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/register-to-watch-a-livestream-recording-of-equity/">hosting a live taping this Thursday</a> that should be a lot of fun. I’ll be there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/"><strong>Twitter starts rolling out Super Follows and ticketed Spaces</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The great product push at Twitter continued today with an early rollout of its Super Follow feature. If you have 10,000 followers and tweet about once per day, you could be eligible to charge people from $2.99 to $9.99 per month for bonus tweets. The company is also rolling out ticketed Twitter Spaces, its live-audio product.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/braves-non-tracking-search-engine-is-now-in-beta/"><strong>Another startup taking on Google</strong></a><strong>: </strong>While we await the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/can-you-beat-google-with-googles-brains/">Neeva’s subscription search alternative</a>, Brave has put its own search offering into the market. You can give it a test <a href="https://search.brave.com/">here</a>, if you’d like. The short gist is that it’s a “nontracking search engine built on top of an independent index and touted as a privacy-safe alternative to surveillance tech products like Google search,” TechCrunch wrote.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/"><strong>The early-stage startup funding market in focus</strong></a><strong>: </strong>TechCrunch dug into the world of seed and early-stage venture capital rounds that startups are raising today. After a VC tipped us off to the concept of Series As coming late and Series Bs coming early, we asked a host of other investors about the idea. What did we learn? That some startups can start raising the moment they close their last round. Wild.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups</h2>
<p>Everyone and their favorite pup raised money today, so we’re breaking our startup coverage into two chunks. The first is focused on product news. The second on funding rounds. Let’s go:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Airbank</strong> is building a small and midsized fintech service to help aggregate all of a company’s bank accounts and financial data. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/airbank-centralizes-all-your-business-bank-accounts-and-financial-data/">Read the story here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Racial Inequity Drawdown</strong> is a framework that aims to “address racial inequity in startup investing and in the broader world,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/firm-creates-open-framework-to-help-vcs-and-founders-address-racial-inequity/">TechCrunch reports</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Squad</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/if-you-love-voice-messaging-youll-love-squad/">launched a new mobile app</a> that connects groups of friends through time-gated audio messages. You have 24 hours to hear what your friends said now that Squad has completed its focus-shift to more intimate collections of friends from interest groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Turning to the money world, there are more rounds than we can get to today. But here’s a selection of favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-another-800m-at-a-6-5b-valuation/">Mollie raises $800 million for its payment-integration service</a>:</strong> Dutch startup Mollie is now worth $6.5 billion after raising nearly $1 billion in a single round. The startup “provides a way for businesses to integrate payments into sites, documents and other services by way of an API,” TechCrunch wrote. Its new round and valuation implies that there’s room yet in the payments space for more mega-unicorns. Still.</li>
<li>Speaking of fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/australian-fintech-zeller-lands-50m-aud-led-by-spark-capital-at-a-400m-aud-valuation/"><strong>Australian startup Zeller just raised AUD$50 million</strong></a> at a AUD$400 million valuation. It provides POS and card services for SMBs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/lidar-company-quanergy-to-go-public-via-1-4b-spac-deal/"><strong>Lidar-focused Quanergy Systems is going public</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Via a SPAC, of course. You can<a href="http://www.spacbyccac.com/doc/Project%20Vision%20PIPE%20Presentation%20vPublic.pdf"> peruse its investor deck</a> if you want all the gritty projections. What matters here is that the SPAC boom is not done, even if it appears to be slowing. And we’re hearing from Series-B-level founders that SPACs are already hitting them up. Expect more and weirder SPAC deals over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/oyster-an-hr-platform-for-distributed-workforces-snaps-up-50m-on-a-475m-valuation/"><strong>Oyster is now a half-unicorn</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s what we learned when the startup focused on supporting employees outside of a company’s home country raised a $50 million Series B that valued it at nearly $500 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/vantage-raises-4m-to-help-businesses-understand-their-aws-costs/">Vantage raises $4M to help folks manage their AWS spend</a>:</strong> All that growth that Amazon’s AWS cloud service has managed in recent years was built on rising customer spend. And some AWS customers want to spend less. And Vantage is going to help.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/g2-raises-157m-for-its-software-review-service/"><strong>G2 raises $157 million to help companies choose software</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Software is such a huge category that even niches can support a host of competitors. But all that spend means lots of companies making choices about what software to leverage. G2 wants to help. And it is now a unicorn after its investors poured nine-figures of capital into its coffers at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Transmit raises $543 million in a Series A to help kill passwords</a>:</strong> The company is now worth $2.2 billion, with plans to use its new money to “expand its reach and investing in key global areas to grow the organization.” Any move to kill passwords is TechCrunch-approved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much to pay yourself as a SaaS founder</h2>
<p>Anna Heim interviewed SaaS entrepreneurs and investors to find out how much early-stage founders should pay themselves.</p>
<p>Startups run by CEOs who take home a small salary tend to do better over the long run, but there are other points to consider, such as geography, marital status, and frankly, what quality of life you desire.</p>
<p>Waterly founder Chris Sosnowski raised his own pay to $14/hour last year; at his prior job, his salary topped $100,000.</p>
<p>“We had saved money up for over a year before we cut out my pay,” he told Anna. “I can live my life without entertainment … so that’s what we did for 2020.”</p>
<p>How much are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Investor Marlon Nichols and founder Chris Bennett review Wonderschool's original pitch deck.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before our conversation on Extra Crunch Live, Marlon Nichols dropped a bomb on me. The MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner hadn’t actually seen Wonderschool’s original pitch deck before investing in the remote education startup. Our conversation with the company’s CEO, Chris Bennett was the first time he’d been through the seed-stage deck.</p>
<p>Their partnership was a bit of Silicon Valley luck, good timing and some old fashioned networking.</p>
<p>“He was a part of an organization that was helping to bring more diverse founders in touch with investors,” says Nichols. “That was happening when I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011. We started to build a casual relationship then. Fast forward to 2016. At my first fund, Cross Culture [Ventures], we were interested in investing in early childhood care. We were actually looking at a number of different companies and one of my partners, Suzy [Ryoo] was like, ‘Have you heard of this company Wonderschool that Chris Bennett was starting, and I was like, ‘Holy shit, I know Chris.’ ”</p>
<p>According to Bennet, Nichols reached out about the opportunity on Facebook Messenger. After the initial conversation and assessing some direct competitors, Nichols says Wonderschool was ultimately the right fit for Cross Culture’s portfolio.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the startup’s origin also has its roots in SV networking.</p>
<p>“I used to go the TED conference every year,” says Bennett. “I met a woman who told me that early childhood education was really important [ … ] She said, ‘A lot of the skills I use today as a CEO, a lot of those seeds were planted before the age of five.’ I thought that was a really wild idea. I started doing research and realized there was a shortage of childcare in America.”</p>
<p>Bennett cringed slightly when we started the process of showing off the company’s early deck. The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points. There’s not flash — or even graphics — to be found in the entire thing. And the CEO adds that honestly, not much changed aesthetically between that first pitch and the Series A deck.</p>
<p>“It aligned with what we were valuing at the time,” says Bennett. “We were really focused on getting the product-market fit and really trying to understand what our customers needed. And we’re really focused on building the team.”</p>
<p>Perhaps there was something to it, however, as Wonderschool managed to raise $20 million for the latter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Viva Republica, the Seoul-based fintech company behind <a href="https://toss.im/en">Toss</a>, a super app with more than 40 financial services, announced today it has raised $410 million at a post-money valuation of $7.4 billion. The new funding was led by Alkeon Capital, an American investment firm, and included participation from new investors like Korea Development Bank, and returning backers Altos Ventures and Greyhound Capital.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch Toss Bank, a neobank, in September 2021, which it describes as “the final key component” of its super app strategy. It will also use the funding to continue its expansion in overseas markets, including Vietnam, where Toss launched last year.</p>
<p>Viva Republica, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/09/toss-becomes-koreas-newest-unicorn/">hit unicorn status in 2018</a>, has now raised more than $940 million in equity funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Founder and chief executive officer SG Lee told TechCrunch that Toss Bank will focus on lending, and also offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates.</p>
<p>“A lot of challenger banks and neobanks are focusing on the banking experience, such as cards, so their main revenue source is interchange fees,” he said. “Toss is quite different because we already cover all that. We cover P2P payment, money transfer, cards and all sorts of services. So we are focusing on loans, unsecured loans, mortgages, all sorts of loans. We are going to use this vehicle to give the most competitive interest rates to users, and Toss Bank will not have a separate app, since we have super app strategy.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168466" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168466" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?w=680" alt="Toss founder SG Lee" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg 2366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SG-Lee.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168466" class="wp-caption-text">Toss founder SG Lee</p></div></p>
<p>One of the reasons Toss Bank is focusing on loans is because if someone has a middling credit score, many South Korean banks will only offer them loans at subprime interest rates, Lee said. Toss Bank will be able to offer better rates because its risk-scoring model leverages data from its millions of users.</p>
<p>Toss now claims a total of 20 million users (or more than a third of South Korea’s 51.7 population) and of that amount, 11 million are monthly active users.</p>
<p>The app launched as a Venmo-like peer-to-peer money transfer platform in 2015, before adding more services. Now its users can turn to the app for almost all of their financial needs.</p>
<p>For example, they can check their balances at different banks and credit cards on a dashboard. Merchants can use Toss Payments to send and receive online payments and manage their business finances. Other features include budgeting tools, bill payments, a credit score tracker and insurance plans. Lee said more than 20% of bank accounts and credit cards in South Korea are already registered on Toss.</p>
<p>As a financial super app, Toss Bank will be able to supplement information from South Korea’s main credit rating agencies with its own data about user transactions: for example, where do they spend money, how often do they spend, their cash flow and balances.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The fintech endgame: New supercompanies combine the best of software and financials&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/the-fintech-endgame-new-supercompanies-combine-the-best-of-software-and-financials/embed/#?secret=7fSjE9qpa3" data-secret="7fSjE9qpa3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lee added that one of South Korea’s leading credit bureaus, KCB (Korea Credit Bureau), backtested Toss’ engine with data from over two million users, and it turned out to be 150% better in terms of differential power analysis and 30% lower in delinquency rates. “This is the first engine that counts this asset-related data, and no machine-learning technologies have been used in credit evaluation” in South Korea, he said. “I think Toss Bank is really well-positioned to disrupt the whole loan market.”</p>
<p>In March, Toss also launched an investment service called Toss Securities, designed to make stock trading accessible to new investors who shy away from traditional brokerages. Over the past three months, it has signed up more than 3.5 million users.</p>
<p>Viva Republica launched Toss in Vietnam, its first international market, in 2020, and the app now has services like no-fee money transfers, debit cards and a financial dashboard through a partnership with CIMB bank. Toss currently claims more than three million monthly active users in Vietnam and says it adds more than 500,000 active users every month. Toss is planning to enter other Southeast Asian markets, too.</p>
<p>Toss hasn’t finalized a timeline, but it is targeting Malaysia for its next market by the end of this year. “The product that we built for Vietnam is actually quite scalable across all Southeast Asia markets, so it’s a matter of time,” Lee said. “But we want to focus on the Vietnam market because it’s scaling increasingly fast and we have to cover the growth.”</p>
<p>As for the possibility of holding an initial public offering or finding another exit opportunity, Lee said the company is still finalizing its plans. “As an Asian company, reaching a $7.4 billion valuation is pretty high, and I think at some point we will face not being able to do more fundraising in the private market. So we’re targeting to raise once more by the end of this year or early next year for over $300 million. That will be our last private fundraising, and then we’re thinking a timeline of three years, and we are reviewing not only for a Korean listing but also a U.S. listing.”</p>
