										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Why did Byju’s raise over $1 billion last year and is already inching closer to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-in-talks-to-raise-over-600-million-at-15-billion-valuation/">securing another half a billion dollars</a>? We are getting some answers today.</p>
<p>Byju’s said on Monday it has acquired Aakash Educational, a 33-year-old chain of physical coaching centres, as the Indian online learning giant looks to further consolidate its leadership position in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The Indian startup paid “close to $1 billion” in cash and equity for the acquisition, which is one of the largest in the edtech space, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. (EY advised the firms on the transaction.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backed by Blackstone, Aakash owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges.</p>
<p>The decades-old firm has made some of its offering available online in recent years, but the pandemic&#8217;s recent shift to students&#8217; preferences made Aakash and Byju&#8217;s explore a deal six-seven months ago, executives from the firm told TechCrunch in a joint interview. (They declined to comment on the financial aspects of the deal.)</p>
<p>Aakash Chaudhry, Managing Director and Co-promoter of Aakash Educational, said the two firms joining forces will offer &#8220;very substantial and value-additive services to students.&#8221; The leadership at Aakash Educational will stay with the firm after the acquisition.</p>
<p>The acquisition will enable the two entities to build the largest omni-channel for students in India, he said. &#8220;Students who have wanted to access physical classrooms have gotten that from us. And those who wanted to access content and learning online has been served by Byju&#8217;s. Together, we will leverage the physical location and technology and online learning and offer students that is unique,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The future of education will blend offline and online experiences, said Byju Ravendran, co-founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, in an interview. And Byju, a teacher himself, would know. Prior to launching the online platform, Ravendran took classes for hundreds of students at stadiums.</p>
<p>For several of Byju’s offerings such as test-preparation, he said, an online-only model is still a few years away. Monday&#8217;s deal is also aimed at expanding the reach of Byju&#8217;s and Aakash Educational in smaller towns and cities, the executives said.</p>
<p>Amit Dixit, Co-head of Asia Acquisitions and Head of India Private Equity at Blackstone at Blackstone, which acquired a 37.5% stake in Aakash for about $183 million in 2019, said that an &#8220;omni-channel will be the winning model in test prep and tutoring, and we look forward to being a part of the partnership between the two foremost companies in Indian supplementary education – Aakash and Byju&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ravendran said the startup is looking to acquire more firms. TechCrunch reported last week that the startup is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/">holding acquisition talks with California-headquartered startup Epic</a> for &#8220;significantly more than $300 million.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meesho said on Monday it has raised $300 million in a new financing round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 as the Indian social commerce startup works to become the &#8220;single ecosystem that will enable all small businesses to succeed online.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series E &#8212; gives the five-year-old startup a valuation of $2.1 billion, up from about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/meesho-india/"> $600 million &#8211; $700 million in the 2019 Series D investment</a>. The Indian startup, which has raised about $490 million to date, said existing investors Facebook, Prosus Ventures, Shunwei Capital, Venture Highway, and Knollwood Investment also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>This deal appears to be Shunwei Capital&#8217;s first investment in an Indian startup in nearly a year. New Delhi last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">introduced a rule</a> to require its approval before a Chinese investor could write a check to an Indian firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bangalore-based Meesho operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/facebook-meesho-first-indian-startup-investment/">eponymous online marketplace</a> that connects sellers with customers on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. Its offerings include order management, taking care of logistics, online payments, real-time shop updates, and allowing businesses to get their customers to subscribe.</p>
<p>The startup claims to have a network of more than 13 million entrepreneurs, a majority of whom are women, over 100,000 suppliers across nearly 5,000 Indian towns and cities that largely deal with grocery, apparel, home appliances and electronics items.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If Meesho&#39;s mission has to be put in a short phrase, it&#39;d be: &quot;financial independence of women&quot;.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a href="https://meesho.com">Meesho</a> said it will deploy the fresh capital to help 100 million individuals and small businesses in the country to sell online. “In the last one year, we have seen tremendous growth across small businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to move their businesses online,&#8221; said Vidit Aatrey, co-founder and chief executive of Meesho, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amid Covid, which prompted New Delhi to issue months-long lockdown, Meesho launched Farmiso, a product that allowed anyone to start an online grocery shop online without any investment. Aatrey said on Monday that Farmiso has emerged as Meesho&#8217;s fastest growing business. (Prior to the pandemic, Meesho had also <a href="https://kr-asia.com/meesho-expects-one-million-users-in-indonesia-qa-with-meeshos-prateek-agarwal">started to expand in Southeast Asia</a>, but has <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/facebookbacked-ecommerce-firm-meesho-shuts-indonesia-operations">scaled down those efforts</a> in recent months.)</p>
<p>“We have been closely tracking Meesho for the last 18 months and have been impressed by their growth, daily engagement metrics, focus on unit economics and ability to create a strong team. We believe Meesho provides an efficient platform for SME suppliers and social resellers to onboard the e-commerce revolution in India and help them provide personalized experience to consumers,” said Sumer Juneja, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>
<p>In a recent report, UBS analysts identified social commerce and business-to-business marketplaces as potential sources of competition to e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Flipkart in India.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133865" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133865" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2133865 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg 1996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=768,372 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=1536,745 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/meesho-mau.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133865" class="wp-caption-text">Data: Meesho</p></div></p>
<p>Social commerce is one prominent bets to take on modern e-commerce that has struggled to make inroads in India, despite billions of dollars ploughed by Amazon and Flipkart. Another bet is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/google-dotpe-india-27-5-million-investment/">digitizing neighborhood stores in the country</a> &#8212; without so much of the social element &#8212; that dot tens of thousands of towns, cities and villages in India. Global giants Facebook and Google are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">backing both the horses</a>.</p>
<p>“Globally, SoftBank has always been excited to back founders that provide unique solutions for the local market. By using the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Meesho has created a platform for many small business owners to sell to the next cohort of internet users. We look forward to being a part of this journey,” said Munish Varma, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LG said on Monday it will close its loss-making mobile phone business worldwide as the once pioneer brand looks to focus its resources in “growth areas” such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, AI and B2B solutions, and platforms and services.</p>
<p>The South Korean firm said in a <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/">statement</a> that its board of directors approved the decision today. The unsurprising move follows the company&#8217;s statement from January when it said it was reviewing the direction of its smartphone business.</p>
<p>LG, which maintained No. 3 spot in the smartphone market in the U.S. for a long time, said it will continue to sell handsets until the inventory lasts, and will provide software support for existing lineup of smartphones for a certain period of time that would vary by region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2133874" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133874" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2133874 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="905" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=150,133 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=680,601 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lg-market-share.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133874" class="wp-caption-text">LG&#8217;s smartphone market share over the years.(Counterpoint Research)</p></div></p>
<p>The company said the status of its employees of phone business will be determined at the local level. In January, reports emerged that said LG was looking to sell its smartphone business. In the same month, the company said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/rollables-are-the-new-foldables/">launch a rollable phone this year</a>. But it appears all the efforts to keep the business stay afloat failed.</p>
<p>“Moving forward, LG will continue to leverage its mobile expertise and develop mobility-related technologies such as 6G to help further strengthen competitiveness in other business areas. Core technologies developed during the two decades of LG’s mobile business operations will also be retained and applied to existing and future products,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The poor financial performance of LG’s smartphone business has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/lg-mobile-still-losing-money/">public information for several years</a>. Like countless other Android smartphone vendors, LG has struggled to turn things around.</p>
<p>LG focused on mid-range and high-end smartphones, two segments of the market that have become increasingly competitive in the past decade thanks to the rise of Chinese phonemakers such as Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, Oppo and Vivo that are launching better value-for-money models every few months. (Once a rival, HTC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/htc-had-a-terrible-2019/">has been struggling</a>, too.)</p>
<p>Several phonemakers today rely heavily on software services such as mobile payments to make money. While LG launched a mobile payments service in 2017, two years after Samsung launched Samsung Pay, LG&#8217;s portfolio of services remained thin throughout the years.</p>
<p>&#8220;LG was too much dependent on two markets: Korea (KR) &amp; North America (NA),&#8221; said Neil Shah, Partner at research firm Counterpoint. &#8220;One thing which has helped LG stay afloat for so many years is their vertical integration. They are a &#8216;mini Samsung,'&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltwitz/status/1378945038692970500">said</a>, pointing to LG Display (displays), LG Chem (batteries), LG Innotek (camera, IoT/auto modules), Silicon Works (semi), and LG Electronics (consumer goods).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday, everyone. I do hope that you are in good spirits and in good health. I am learning to nap, something that has become a requirement in my life after I realized that the news cycle is never going to slow down. And because my partner and I <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1378035858264166400">adopted a third dog</a> who likes to get up early, please join me in making napping cool for adults, so that we can all rest up for Vaccine Summer. It’s nearly here.</p>
<p>On work topics, I have a few things for you today, all concerning data points that matter: Q1 2021 M&amp;A data, March VC results from Africa, and some surprising (to me, at least) podcast numbers.</p>
<p>On the first, <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack">Dan Primack</a> shared a few early first-quarter data points <a href="https://www.refinitiv.com/en">via Refinitiv</a> that I wanted to pass along. Per the financial data firm, global M&amp;A activity hit $1.3 trillion in Q1 2021, up 93% from Q1 2020. U.S. M&amp;A activity reached an all-time high in the first quarter, as well. Why do we care? Because the data helps underscore just how hot the last three months have been.</p>
<p>I’m expecting venture capital data itself for the quarter to be similarly impressive. But as everyone is noting this week, there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">some cracks</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">appearing</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">in the IPO market</a>, as the second quarter begins that could make Q2 2021 a very different beast. Not that the venture capital world will slow, especially given that Tiger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">just reloaded</a> to the tune of $6.7 billion.</p>
<p>On the venture capital topic, African-focused data firm <a href="https://briterbridges.com/">Briter Bridges</a> reports that “March alone saw over $280 million being deployed into tech companies operating across Africa,” driven in part by “Flutterwave’s whopping $170 million round at a $1 billion valuation.”</p>
<p>The data point matters as it marks the most active March that the African continent has seen in venture capital terms since at least 2017 &#8212; and I would guess ever. African startups tend to raise more capital in the second half of the year, so the March result is not an all-time record for a single month. But it’s bullish all the same, and helps feed our general sentiment that the first quarter’s venture capital results could be big.</p>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury">Index Ventures’ Rex Woodbury</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury/status/1378001533741064193">tweeted</a> some Edison data, namely that “80 million Americans (28% of the U.S. 12+ population) are weekly podcast listeners, +17% year-over-year.” The venture capitalist went on to add that “62% of the U.S. 12+ population (around 176 million people) are weekly online audio listeners.”</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/clubhouse-will-create-billions-in-value-and-capture-none-of-it/">discussed on Equity</a> this week, the non-music, streaming audio market is being bet on by a host of players in light of Clubhouse’s success as a breakout consumer social company in recent months. Undergirding the bets by Discord and Spotify and others are those data points. People love to listen to other humans talk. Far more than I would have imagined, as a music-first person.</p>
<p>How nice it is to be back in a time when consumer investing is neat. B2B is great but not everything can be enterprise SaaS. (Notably, however, it does appear that Clubhouse is <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1377332954007957508">struggling to hold onto its own hype</a>.)</p>

<h2>Look I can’t keep up with all the damn venture capital rounds</h2>
<p>TechCrunch Early Stage was this week, which went rather well. But having an event to help put on did mean that I covered fewer rounds this week than I would have liked. So, here are two that I would have typed up if I had had the spare hours:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.striim.com/">Striim’s</a> <a href="https://www.striim.com/press/50m-series-c-funding-goldman-sachs-growth-equity/">$50 million Series C</a>. Goldman led the transaction. Striim, pronounced stream I believe, is a software startup that helps other companies move data around their cloud and on-prem setups in real time. Given how active the data market is today, I presume that the TAM for Striim is deep? Quickly flowing? You can supply a better stream-centered word at your leisure.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://kudoway.com/">Kudo’s</a> <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/multilingual_video_conference_platform_kudo_closes_21m_in_an_oversubscribed_series_a_funding_to_support_talent_acquisition_and_more/prweb17829894.htm">$21 million Series A</a>. I covered Kudo last July <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/">when it raised $6 million</a>. The company provides video-chat and conferencing services with support for  real-time translation. It had a good COVID-era, as you can imagine. Felicis led the A after taking part in the seed round. I’ll see if I can extract some fresh growth metrics from the company next week. One to watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>And two more rounds that you also might have missed that you should not. Holler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/holler-series-b/">raised $36 million in a Series B</a>. Per our own Anthony Ha, “[y]ou may not know what conversational media is, but there’s a decent chance you’ve used Holler’s technology. For example, if you’ve added a sticker or a GIF to your Venmo payments, Holler actually manages the app’s search and suggestion experience around that media.”</p>
<p>I feel old.</p>
<p>And in case you are not paying enough attention to Latin American tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/">this $150 million Uruguayan round</a> should help set you straight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oJ2LHAI804"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">Is Substack really worth $650M?</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Finally this week, some good news. If you’ve read The Exchange for any length of time, you’ve been forced to read me prattling on about the <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">Bessemer cloud index</a>, a basket of public software companies that I treat with oracular respect. Now there’s a new index on the market.</p>
<p>Meet the <a href="https://www.luxhealthtechindex.com/">Lux Health + Tech Index</a>. Per Lux Capital, it’s an “index of 57 publicly traded companies that together best represent the rapidly emerging Health + Tech investment theme.” Sure, this is branded to the extent that, akin to the Bessemer collection, it is tied to a particular focus of the backing venture capital firm. But what the new Lux index will do, as with the Bessemer collection, is track how a particular venture firm is itself tracking the public comps for their portfolio.</p>
<p>That’s a useful thing to have. More of this, please.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon kicked off the holiday weekend by <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/our-recent-response-to-representative-pocan">backtracking slightly</a> on a social media offensive that unfolded in the waning days of a historic unionization vote. The earlier  comments reportedly arrived as <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren">Jeff Bezos was pushing</a> for a more aggressive strategy.</p>
<p>Along with taking on Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Amazon News Twitter account went toe to toe with Congressman, Mark Pocan. The Wisconsin Democrat cited oft-reported stories of Amazon workers urinating in bottles in reaction to comments from Consumer CEO, Dave Clark.</p>
<p>“You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” the account asked. “If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.</p>
<p>&mdash; Amazon News (@amazonnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Congressman’s initial response was pithy and to the point: “[Y]es, I do believe your workers. You don&#8217;t?”</p>
<p>Subsequent reports have served to cement those stories. <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/">One called</a> the urination issue “widespread” among Amazon drivers, adding that defecation had also, reportedly, become a problem. Last night, the company offered a mea culpa of sorts, saying it “owe[s] an apology to Representative Pocan.”</p>
<p>Things break down a bit from there. Amazon’s apology acknowledges that workers peeing in bottles is a thing, but appears to imply that it’s limited to drivers and not the fulfillment center staff at the center of this large scale unionization effort. From there, the company adds that drivers peeing in bottles is an “industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Kj6ZAoWzlk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/">Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/embed/#?secret=Kj6ZAoWzlk" data-secret="Kj6ZAoWzlk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company helpfully includes a list of links and tweets that are, at very least, an indictment of the gig economy and the treatment of blue collar workers, generally. Essentially, Amazon is admitting to being a part of the problem, while working to spread the blame across an admittedly faulty system.</p>
<p>Reports of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-warehouse-workers-have-to-pee-into-bottles-2018-4?utm_source=reddit.com">workers urinating in bottles</a> also go beyond drivers, including stories of warehouse employees resorting to the act in order to meet stringent quotas.</p>
<p>“A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms, and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time,” company writes in the post attributed to anonymous Amazon Staff. “If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience, we encourage them to speak to their manager and we&#8217;ll work to fix it.”</p>
<p>Union vote counting for the company&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse began last week. Results could have a wide-ranging impact on both Amazon and the industry at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the end of 2020, I argued that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">edtech needs to think bigger</a> in order to stay relevant after the pandemic. I urged founders to think less about how to bundle and unbundle lecture experience, and more about how to replace outdated systems and methods with new, tech-powered solutions. In other words, don’t simply put engaging content on a screen, but innovate on what that screen looks like, tracks and offers.</p>
<p>A few months into 2021, the exit environment in edtech&#8230;feels like it’s doing exactly that. The same startups that hit billion and multi-billion valuations during the pandemic are scooping up new talent to broaden their service offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rubenharris">Ruben Harris</a>, the founder of <a href="https://careerkarma.com/">Career Karma</a>, a platform that matches aspiring coding professionals to bootcamps, put together a massive report recently with his team to talk about <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/">the pandemic’s impact on the bootcamp market.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>James Gallagher, the author of <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/">the report</a>, tells me:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to note that the full potential of bootcamps has not yet been realised. We are now seeing more exploration of niches like technology sales which provide gateways into new careers in tech for people who otherwise may not have been able to acquire training. To scale such models, new businesses will need venture capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on to explain how a notable acquisition from 2020 was K12 scooping up Galvanize, “which would give K12 exposure into corporate training and the coding bootcamp space, a market outside of K12&#8217;s focus at the moment.”</p>
<p>To me this report signal two things: the financial interest in boot camps isn’t simply stemming from other bootcamps (although that is happening), but it’s surprising partnerships. Leaving this subsector, we see creative acquisitions such as a Roblox for edtech buying a language learning tool, and a startup known for flashcards scooping up a tech tutoring service.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/ ">How is edtech spending its extra capital</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/">Byju’s in talks to acquire US-based reading platform, Epic </a></li>
<li><a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/">The tech-powered wave of smart, not slow, tutoring sessions </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Readers should know by this point that I love a nonobvious acquisition (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok/">except when this almost happened</a>), so if you have any more tips on coming deals in edtech, please Signal me or <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">direct message me on Twitter. </a></p>
<p>I’ll end with this: Successful startup founders are innately ambitious, finding opportunity in moonshots and convincing others that the odds are in their favor. However, the ceiling for what defines ambition heightens almost everyday. What used to be a win is now a nonnegotiable, and a feat is only a feat until your competitor hits the exact same milestone.</p>

<p>Acquisitions are one way to scoop up competition and synergistic talent, but it’s what happens next that matters the most.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we will talk about Clubhouse competitors, how a homegrown experiment became one of the fastest growing companies in fitness tech and a cool-down in public markets (?!).

<h2><strong>Clubhouse might create billions in value, but could capture none of it</strong></h2>
<p>Remember when everyone was buzzing around about building Stories? That’s so pre-pandemic. A number of companies recently announced plans to build their own versions of Clubhouse, after the buzzy app unearthed the consumer love for audio.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> It might be easier to start guessing who isn’t building a Clubhouse clone at this point. Our predictions are already starting, but jokes aside, the rise in clones could mean that Clubhouse might have to make a run for its pre-monetized money (cough, cough, Twitter spaces). It doesn’t matter if a startup is first in unlocking a key insight, all that matters is who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/clubhouse-will-create-billions-in-value-and-capture-none-of-it/?tpcc=ECTW2020">executes that key insight the best. </a></p>

<h2><strong>Initial public o….no</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve probably had a better week than Compass, Deliveroo and Kaltura. The three companies all had different events that illustrate a potential damper on the part that has been the public markets.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Compass <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">cut its shares and lowered pricing</a> of said shares, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">Deliveroo had a rough debut</a> as a delivery company on the public markets, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">Kaltura postponed its IPO</a> after valuation demand didn’t hit expectations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amber Group claimed it faced "cyberattacks, hacking and mischievous players." In reality, the app was just not that secure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As governments scrambled to lock down their populations after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/covid-19-officially-declared-a-pandemic-by-the-who-as-deaths-pass-4000/">COVID-19 pandemic was declared</a> last March, some countries had plans underway to reopen. By June, Jamaica became one of the first countries to open its borders.</p>
<p>Tourism represents about <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/05/27/na052720-jamaica-ramps-up-social-and-economic-support-in-covid-19-response">one-fifth of Jamaica&#8217;s economy</a>. In 2019 alone, four million travelers visited Jamaica, bringing thousands of jobs to its three million residents. But as COVID-19 stretched into the summer, Jamaica&#8217;s economy was in free fall, and tourism was its only way back — even if that meant <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/after-beating-back-the-coronavirus-jamaica-prioritizes-tourism-over-public-health">at the expense of public health</a>.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government contracted with Amber Group, a technology company headquartered in Kingston, to build a border entry system allowing residents and travelers back onto the island. The system was named JamCOVID and was rolled out as an app and a website to allow visitors to get screened before they arrive. To cross the border, travelers had to upload a negative COVID-19 test result to JamCOVID before boarding their flight from high-risk countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>Amber Group&#8217;s CEO Dushyant Savadia boasted that his company developed JamCOVID in <a href="https://www.bvibeacon.com/ceo-explains-quarantine-tracking-tech/">&#8220;three days&#8221;</a> and that it effectively donated the system to the Jamaican government, which in turn pays Amber Group for additional features and customizations. The rollout appeared to be a success, and Amber Group later secured contracts to roll out its border entry system to at least four other Caribbean islands.</p>
<p>But last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">TechCrunch revealed</a> that JamCOVID exposed immigration documents, passport numbers, and COVID-19 lab test results on close to half a million travelers — including many Americans — who visited the island over the past year. Amber Group had set the access to the JamCOVID cloud server to public, allowing anyone to access its data from their web browser.</p>
<p>Whether the data exposure was caused by human error or negligence, it was an embarrassing mistake for a technology company — and, by extension, the Jamaican government — to make.</p>
<p>And that might have been the end of it. Instead, the government&#8217;s response became the story.</p>
<h2>A trio of security lapses</h2>
<p>By the end of the first wave of coronavirus, contact tracing apps were still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/apple-google-coronavirus-tracing/">in their infancy</a> and few governments had plans in place to screen travelers as they arrived at their borders. It was a scramble for governments to build or acquire technology to understand the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Jamaica was one of a handful of countries using <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/jamaica-reopen-covid-visit-precaution">location data</a> to monitor travelers, prompting rights groups to <a href="https://jamaicansforjustice.org/jfj-geofence-enquiry/">raise concerns</a> about privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>As part of an investigation into a broad range of these COVID-19 apps and services, TechCrunch found that JamCOVID was storing data on an exposed, passwordless server.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3vrBSrlZIY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">Jamaica&#8217;s immigration website exposed thousands of travelers&#8217; data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jamaica&#8217;s immigration website exposed thousands of travelers&#8217; data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/embed/#?secret=3vrBSrlZIY" data-secret="3vrBSrlZIY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This wasn’t the first time TechCrunch found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/">security flaws</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/labcorp-website-bug-medical-data-exposed/">exposed data</a> through our reporting. It also was not the first pandemic-related security scare. Israeli spyware maker NSO Group left <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/nso-fleming-data-location/">real location data</a> on an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/">unprotected server</a> that it used for demonstrating its new contact tracing system. Norway was one of the first countries with a contact tracing app, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/norway-pulls-its-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-after-privacy-watchdogs-warning/">pulled it</a> after the country&#8217;s privacy authority found the continuous tracking of citizens&#8217; location was a privacy risk.</p>
<p>Just as we have with any other story, we contacted who we thought was the server&#8217;s owner. We alerted Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of Health to the data exposure on the weekend of February 13. But after <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20489174-email-to-jamaica-ministry-of-health">we provided specific details</a> of the exposure to ministry spokesperson Stephen Davidson, we did not hear back. Two days later, the data was still exposed.</p>
<p>After we spoke to two American travelers whose data was spilling from the server, we narrowed down the owner of the server to Amber Group. We contacted its chief executive Savadia on February 16, who acknowledged the email but did not comment, and the server was secured about an hour later.</p>
<p>We ran our story that afternoon. After we published, the Jamaican government <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/jamcovid-security-protocols-strengthened/">issued a statement</a> claiming the lapse was &#8220;discovered on February 16&#8221; and was &#8220;immediately rectified,&#8221; neither of which were true.</p>

	</p>
<p>Instead, the government responded by launching <a href="https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210219/prosecution-threat-jamcovid-breach">a criminal investigation</a> into whether there was any &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; access to the unprotected data that led to our first story, which we perceived to be a thinly veiled threat directed at this publication. The government said it had contacted its overseas law enforcement partners.</p>
<p>When reached, a spokesperson for the FBI declined to say whether the Jamaican government had contacted the agency.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t get much better for JamCOVID. In the days that followed the first story, the government engaged a cloud consultant, Escala 24&#215;7, to assess JamCOVID&#8217;s security. The results were not disclosed, but the company said it <a href="https://nationwideradiojm.com/prominent-cyber-security-firm-says-theres-no-current-vulnerability-in-jam-covid-app/">was confident</a> there was &#8220;no current vulnerability&#8221; in JamCOVID. Amber Group also said that the lapse was a &#8220;completely isolated occurrence.&#8221;</p>
<p>A week went by and TechCrunch alerted Amber Group to two more security lapses. After the attention from the first report, a security researcher who saw the news of the first lapse found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/jamaica-amber-group-jamcovid-security-lapse/">exposed private keys and passwords</a> for JamCOVID&#8217;s servers and databases hidden on its website, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/amber-group-jamcovid-data-exposed/">a third lapse</a> that spilled quarantine orders for more than half a million travelers.</p>
<p>Amber Group and the government <a href="https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/front-page/amber-sees-red-jamcovid-developer-eyes-defamation-action-as-controversy-swirls_215623?profile=1373">claimed it faced</a> &#8220;cyberattacks, hacking and mischievous players.&#8221; In reality, the app was just not that secure.</p>
<h2>Politically inconvenient</h2>
<p>The security lapses come at a politically inconvenient time for the Jamaican government, as it attempts to launch a national identification system, or NIDS, for the second time. NIDS will store biographic data on Jamaican nationals, including their biometrics, such as their fingerprints.</p>
<p>The repeat effort comes two years after the government&#8217;s first law was <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=24c65ab3-7105-49ee-8907-59639c7df631">struck down</a> by Jamaica&#8217;s High Court as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Critics have cited the JamCOVID security lapses as a reason to drop the proposed national database. A coalition of privacy and rights groups <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-response-jamaica-digital-id-bill/">cited the recent issues with JamCOVID </a>for why a national database is &#8220;potentially dangerous for Jamaicans’ privacy and security.&#8221; A spokesperson for Jamaica&#8217;s opposition party <a href="https://www.loopjamaica.com/content/jcans-may-hesitate-sign-nids-after-jamcovid-breach-graham">told local media</a> that there &#8220;wasn’t much confidence in NIDS in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than a month since we published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">the first story</a> and there are many unanswered questions, including how Amber Group secured the contract to build and run JamCOVID, how the cloud server became exposed, and if security testing was conducted before its launch.</p>
<p>TechCrunch emailed both the Jamaican prime minister&#8217;s office and Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica&#8217;s Ministry of National Security, to ask how much, if anything, the government donated or paid to Amber Group to run JamCOVID and what security requirements, if any, were agreed upon for JamCOVID. We did not get a response.</p>
<p>Amber Group also has not said how much it has earned from its government contracts. Amber Group&#8217;s Savadia <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">declined to disclose</a> the value of the contracts to one local newspaper. Savadia did not respond to our emails with questions about its contracts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Following the second security lapse, Jamaica&#8217;s opposition party demanded that the prime minister release the contracts that govern the agreement between the government and Amber Group. Prime Minister Andrew Holness said at a press conference that the public &#8220;should know&#8221; about government contracts but <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210302/pm-public-should-see-commish-contracts">warned &#8220;legal hurdles&#8221;</a> may prevent disclosure, such as for national security reasons or when &#8220;sensitive trade and commercial information&#8221; might be disclosed.</p>
<p>That came days after local newspaper The Jamaica Gleaner had a <a href="https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210228/access-denied-transparency-advocates-surprised-states-refusal-disclose">request to obtain</a> contracts revealing the salaries state officials denied by the government under a legal clause that prevents the disclosure of an individual&#8217;s private affairs. Critics argue that taxpayers have a right to know how much government officials are paid from public funds.</p>
<p>Jamaica&#8217;s opposition party also asked what was done to notify victims.</p>
<p>Government minister Samuda initially downplayed the security lapse, claiming <a href="https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210222/another-alleged-jamcovid-security-flaw-uncovered">just 700 people</a> were affected. We scoured social media for proof but found nothing. To date, we&#8217;ve found no evidence that the Jamaican government ever informed travelers of the security incident — either the hundreds of thousands of affected travelers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">whose information was exposed</a>, or the 700 people that the government <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20210222/another-alleged-jamcovid-security-flaw-uncovered">claimed it notified</a> but has not publicly released.</p>
<p>TechCrunch emailed the minister to request a copy of the notice that the government allegedly sent to victims, but we did not receive a response. We also asked Amber Group and Jamaica&#8217;s prime minister&#8217;s office for comment. We did not hear back.</p>
<p>Many of the victims of the security lapse are from the United States. Neither of the two Americans we spoke to in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/jamaica-immigration-travelers-data-exposed/">our first report</a> were notified of the breach.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for the attorneys general of New York and Florida, whose residents&#8217; information <a href="https://opm.gov.jm/speech/remarks-by-the-most-honourable-andrew-holness-on-mp-prime-minister-in-parliament-on-july-28-2020/">was exposed</a>, told TechCrunch that they had not heard from either the Jamaican government or the contractor, despite state laws requiring data breaches to be disclosed.</p>

<p>The reopening of Jamaica&#8217;s borders came at a cost. The island saw <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/after-beating-back-the-coronavirus-jamaica-prioritizes-tourism-over-public-health">over a hundred new cases</a> of COVID-19 in the month that followed, the majority arriving from the United States. From June to August, the number of new coronavirus cases went from tens to dozens to hundreds each day.</p>
<p>To date, Jamaica has reported over 39,500 cases and 600 deaths caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Holness reflected on the decision to reopen its borders last month in parliament to announce <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20537859-jamaica-budget-2021">the country&#8217;s annual budget</a>. He said the country&#8217;s economic decline last was &#8220;driven by a massive 70% contraction in our tourist industry.&#8221; More than 525,000 travelers — both residents and tourists — have arrived in Jamaica since the borders opened, Holness said, a figure slightly more than the number of travelers&#8217; records found on the exposed JamCOVID server in February.</p>
<p>Holness defended reopening the country&#8217;s borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had we not done this the fall out in tourism revenues would have been 100% instead of 75%, there would be no recovery in employment, our balance of payment deficit would have worsened, overall government revenues would have been threatened, and there would be no argument to be made about spending more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Both the Jamaican government and Amber Group benefited from opening the country&#8217;s borders. The government wanted to revive its falling economy, and Amber Group enriched its business with fresh government contracts. But neither paid enough attention to cybersecurity, and victims of their negligence deserve to know why.</p>

Here are a dozen companies and proposals from this batch that are especially compelling or suggest new directions for missions and industry in space.</p>
<p>Sadly these brief descriptions are often all that is available. These things are often so early stage that there&#8217;s nothing to show but some equations and a drawing on the back of a napkin — but NASA knows promising work when it sees it. (You can learn more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/how-to-access-americas-seed-fund-the-3-billion-sbir-program/">how to apply for SBIR grants here</a>.)</p>

<p>Martian Sky Technologies wins the backronym award with Decluttering of Earth Orbit to Repurpose for Bespoke Innovative Technologies, or DEORBIT, an effort to create an autonomous clutter-removal system for low Earth orbit. It is intended to monitor a given volume and remove any intruding items, clearing the area for construction or occupation by another craft.</p>

<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-Z3.03-2606.html">Ultrasonic additive manufacturing</a></p>
<p>There are lots of proposals for various forms of 3D printing, welding, and other things important to the emerging field of &#8220;On-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing&#8221; or OSAM. One I found interesting uses ultrasonics, which is weird to me because clearly, in space, there&#8217;s no atmosphere for ultrasonic to work in (I&#8217;m going to guess they thought of that). But this kind of counterintuitive approach could lead to a truly new approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-Z3.04-2299.html">Robots watch each other&#8217;s backs</a></p>
<p>Doing OSAM work will likely involve coordinating multiple robotic platforms, something that&#8217;s hard enough on Earth. TRAClabs is looking into a way to &#8220;enhance perceptual feedback and decrease the cognitive load on operators&#8221; by autonomously moving robots not in use to positions where they can provide useful viewpoints of the others. It&#8217;s a simple idea and fits with the way humans tend to work — if you&#8217;re not the person doing the actual task, you automatically move out of the way and to a good position to see what&#8217;s happening.</p>

<p>Hall effect thrusters are a highly efficient form of electric propulsion that could be very useful in certain types of in-space maneuvering. But they&#8217;re not particularly powerful, and it seems that to build larger ones existing manufacturing techniques will not suffice. Elementum 3D aims to accomplish it by developing a new additive manufacturing technique and cobalt-iron feedstock that should let them make these things as big as they want.</p>
<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-S3.03-3308.html">Venusian batteries</a></p>
<p>Venus is a fascinating place, but its surface is extremely hostile to machines the way they&#8217;re built here on Earth. Even hardened Mars rovers like Perseverance would succumb in minutes, seconds even in the 800F heat. And among the many ways they would fail is that the batteries they use would overheat and possibly explode. TalosTech and the University of Delaware are looking into an unusual type of battery that would operate at high temperatures by using atmospheric CO2 as a reactant.</p>
<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-H6.22-1743.html">Neuromorphic low-SWaP radio</a></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re going to space, every gram and cubic centimeter counts, and once you&#8217;re out there, every milliwatt does as well. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s always a push to switch legacy systems to low size, weight, and power (low-SWaP) alternatives. Intellisense is taking on part of the radio stack, using neuromorphic (i.e. brainlike &#8211; but not in a sci-fi way) computing to simplify and shrink the part that sorts and directs incoming signals. Every gram saved is one more spacecraft designers can put to work elsewhere, and they may get some performance gains as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-S3.04-2932.html">Making space safer with lidar</a></p>
<p>Astrobotic is becoming a common name to see in NASA&#8217;s next few years of interplanetary missions, and its research division is looking at ways to make both spacecraft and surface vehicles like rovers smarter and safer using lidar. <a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sbir/phase1/SBIR-21-1-S3.04-2932.html">One proposal</a> is a lidar system narrowly focused on imaging single small objects in a sparse scene (e.g. scanning one satellite from another against the vastness of space) for the purposes of assessment and repair. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/nasa-picks-astrobotic-to-deliver-its-water-hunting-robot-rover-to-the-moon/">The second</a> involves a deep learning technique applied to both lidar and traditional imagery to identify obstacles on a planet&#8217;s surface. The team for that one is currently also working on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/nasa-picks-astrobotic-to-deliver-its-water-hunting-robot-rover-to-the-moon/">VIPER water-hunting rover</a> aiming for a 2023 lunar landing.</p>

<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sttr/phase1/STTR-21-1-T6.07-1224.html">Monitoring space farms</a></p>
<p>Bloomfield does automated monitoring of agriculture, but growing plants in orbit or on the surface or Mars is a little different than here on Earth. But it&#8217;s hoping to expand to Controlled Environment Agriculture, which is to say the little experimental farms we&#8217;ve used to see how plants grow under weird conditions like microgravity. They plan to use multi-spectral imaging and deep learning analysis thereof to monitor the state of plants constantly so astronauts don&#8217;t have to write &#8220;leaf 25 got bigger&#8221; every day in a notebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/21/sttr/phase1/STTR-21-1-T7.04-1428.html">Regolith bricks</a></p>
<p>The Artemis program is all about going to the Moon &#8220;to stay,&#8221; but we haven&#8217;t quite figured out that last part. Researchers are looking into how to refuel and launch rockets from the lunar surface without bringing everything involved with them, and Exploration Architecture aims to take on a small piece of that, building a lunar launchpad literally brick by brick. It proposes an integrated system that takes lunar dust or regolith, melts it down, then bakes it into bricks to be placed wherever needed. It&#8217;s either that or bring Earth bricks, and I can tell you that&#8217;s not a good option.</p>

<p>Several other companies and research agencies proposed regolith-related construction and handling as well. It was one of a handful of themes, some of which are a little too in the weeds to go into.</p>
<p>Another theme was technologies for exploring ice worlds like Europa. Sort of like the opposite of Venus, an ice planet will be lethal to &#8220;ordinary&#8221; rovers in many ways and the conditions necessitate different approaches for power, sensing, and traversal.</p>
<p>NASA isn&#8217;t immune to the new trend of swarms, be they satellite or aircraft. Managing these swarms takes a lot of doing, and if they&#8217;re to act as a single distributed machine (which is the general idea) they need a robust computing architecture behind them. Numerous companies are looking into ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re looking into app store trends, Apple&#8217;s upcoming WWDC, new App Store rejections and what they mean for ATT (App Tracking Transparency), and whatever happened to that Arizona App Store bill, among other stories.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Apps just had the biggest quarter on record</h3>
<p><strong>Big news for the app economy this week, as App Annie reported that consumer spending on mobile apps broke a new record.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/consumers-spent-32b-on-apps-in-q1-2021-the-biggest-quarter-on-record/">According to new data,</a> worldwide consumers in Q1 2021 spent $32 billion on apps across both iOS and Google Play, up 40% year-over-year from Q1 2020. It’s the largest-ever quarter on record, with mobile consumers spending roughly $9 billion more in Q1 2021 compared with Q1 2020, in part due to the pandemic&#8217;s continued impacts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Consumer-Spend.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Although iOS saw larger consumer spend than Android in the quarter — $21 billion versus $11 billion, respectively — both stores grew by the same percentage, 40%. Gaming drove a majority of the quarter’s consumer spending, as usual, accounting for $22 billion of the spend — $13 billion on iOS (up 30% year-over-year) and $9 billion on Android (up 35%).</p>

<h3>Apple begins rejecting apps with fingerprinting tech</h3>
<p><strong>With the launch of iOS 14.5 looming, reports circulated this week that Apple has begun rejecting apps that use third-party SDKs that track users via a method called device fingerprinting</strong>. The Adjust SDK was one that didn&#8217;t yet comply with Apple&#8217;s new App Tracking Transparency guidelines, causing apps that included the SDK to be rejected. That could have been a large number of possible rejections, as Adjust&#8217;s website claims it&#8217;s trusted by more than 50,000 apps. But <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/04/01/apple-rejecting-apps-with-fingerprinting-enabled-as-ios-14-privacy-enforcement-starts/?sh=36ed1ce13d19">Adjust soon updated its SDK</a> (open-sourced and <a href="https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk/commit/8790a5300d00a11b8f51c7cc66c94165ac656f8c">here</a> on GitHub), to hopefully re-enable app updates for its customers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Per a number of developers, Apple has begun rejecting app updates that include the Adjust SDK related to its collection of data used for device fingerprinting.</p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Seufert (@eric_seufert) <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_seufert/status/1377596078179123202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) changes have thrown a whole industry into disarray as companies scramble to comply and diversify their revenues. Snap, however, was found to be looking into alternative ways to bypass ATT by gathering data like IP addresses from companies that analyze ad campaigns to see if it could then cross-reference that data with its own, in order to continue tracking its users. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd724838-d37f-4894-b986-e4675482161e?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6">Snap told the Financial Times</a> it had tested the technique, called probabilistic matching, to test the impact of Apple&#8217;s policies, but claimed it intended to discontinue the program after Apple introduced its changes. (Sure Jan!) The company says it believes that tracking individual users will no longer be allowed going forward, but gathering data on &#8220;cohorts&#8221; would be. On Thursday, Apple sent letters to developers warning them to remove code that supported probabilistic matching, just in case.</p>
<h3>WWDC 2021 announced</h3>
<p><strong>WWDC will again be virtual,</strong> Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=t5jm3yaz">announced</a> this week. The online event will take place June 7 to 11, as it did last year, allowing developers worldwide to tune in to watch prerecorded keynotes and sessions, and virtually network and learn from Apple engineers and employees. Though April 18, students can submit their Swift playground to this year&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/swift-student-challenge/">Swift Student Challenge</a> to win exclusive outerwear and Apple pins.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Everyone has already begun to read wayyyy too much into the imagery Apple published, which shows Memoji characters wearing glasses looking at a Mac screen. Is Apple teasing AR glasses?, some wondered. That doesn&#8217;t seem likely, though. The glasses are just a way to reflect the computer screen in a picture whose message largely conveys, <em>yep, it&#8217;s another virtual event this year.</em></p>
<h2>The Arizona App Store bill is dead</h2>

Last week, it had been unclear why the AZ Senate skipped the vote on the bill, which had been passed by the AZ House. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22357121/arizona-hb2005-app-store-bill-dead-apple-google-big-tech-lobbying">according to the bill&#8217;s (HB2005) backer</a>, Rep. Regina Cobb, speaking to The Verge, the decision was due to heavy lobbying by Apple and Google, which caused Senate members who had agreed to a vote to waiver. When the votes weren&#8217;t there, the Senate decided to skip bringing it up altogether.</p>
<p>Cobb, in an email to TechCrunch, confirmed the same. &#8220;We have been working with members on the committee and had the votes a few days prior,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just before the committee was set to proceed, the Chairman notified the lobbyist for App Fairness that the votes were not there so he did not want to waste committee time on the issue.&#8221;</p>

With iOS 14.5, Siri will no longer default to a female voice, but will rather allow customers to choose from a set of voices, presented in random order. Prior to the release, there had been some expectation that beta 5 would be the last before the public release, but that turned out to not be the case. However, now that beta 6 has arrived, the Release Candidate could follow as soon as next week.</p>

Throughout 2020, consumers turned to iPhone apps for work, school, entertainment, shopping and more, driving per-user spending to a new record and the greatest annual growth since 2016. Per-device spending on mobile games was a large part of that figure, growing 43% year over year from $53.80 in 2019 to $76.80 in 2020. That’s more than 20 points higher than the 22% growth seen between 2018 and 2019, when in-game spending grew from $44 to $53.80.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mental-health-therapy-apps.html">feature in The Cut</a> this week raises questions about the viability and effectiveness of therapy apps like Talkspace, BetterHelp and AbleTo,</strong> some which use dating app-like models for matching clients to therapists as well as similar business models, where you can upgrade to live video and more features.

<p><strong>Facebook teamed up with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/facebook-launches-profile-frames-that-help-you-encourage-friends-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/">launch a set of profile frames</a></strong> that will help to encourage vaccinations against COVID-19. The frames, offered in either English or Spanish, will say “Let’s Get Vaccinated” or “I Got My COVID-19 Vaccine.&#8221; Research shows that social norms can impact people&#8217;s behavior when it comes to their health, so the hope is that, as more adopt the frames, those hesitant about the vaccine will be encouraged to get one. Facebook will also begin showing users how many of their family and friends have been vaccinated, based on the frame usage.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/facebook-denies-its-algorithms-are-a-problem-but-launches-a-tool-to-more-easily-view-a-non-algorithmic-news-feed/">introduced new tools</a> that allow users to more easily switch to the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view or &#8220;Favorites&#8221; view of their News Feed</strong>, as well as tools to limit comments on posts and other changes. The launch came at the same time as the company argued in a long-winded post how its personalization algorithms are not at fault for the world&#8217;s ills and the rising spread of misinformation and dangerous health content. Rather, it blames the users who seek out this content and then engage with it. The company is pushing regulators to give it guidelines on misinformation, knowing that it will have an easier time with increased regulations than any new social media upstarts.</p>

<p><strong>Following the meme stock frenzy, free stock trading app Robinhood <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-to-remove-controversial-digital-confetti-from-trading-app-11617195612?mod=djemalertNEWS">will remove its controversial digital confetti feature</a></strong>, which critics said was a gamification technique &#8212; and not something that should be associated with financial investing.</p>
<p><strong>WhatsApp Pay, the messaging app&#8217;s P2P payments feature, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-brazil-payments-idUSKBN2BM37H">is now authorized in Brazil</a>.</strong> The feature was first announced to roll out in Brazil last year, but had to be delayed after the country&#8217;s central bank said it could damage existing payments systems. It also said WhatsApp had failed to obtain proper licensing. On Tuesday, the bank said the service could go forward &#8212; now that it&#8217;s launched its own payments system called Pix, which has been widely adopted.</p>
<p><strong>Bakkt <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/03/30/exclusive-bakkt-releases-digital-wallet-app">released a digital wallet app</a> for trading fiat currency for crypto, but also supports other digital assets not on the blockchain</strong> like frequent flier miles, loyalty points, gift cards and in-game assets.</p>

The AI-based personal assistant was Microsoft&#8217;s answer to Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant, but with more integration into Microsoft&#8217;s own apps. The mobile version, however, never caught on and Microsoft has since refocused on AI assistance built directly into its Microsoft 365 apps instead.</p>

<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Republicans on the House and Senate antitrust committees <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/01/republican-lawmakers-grill-apple-amazon-and-google-over-parler-removal">wrote letters to Apple, Google and Amazon, asking them about Parler&#8217;s removal</a> from their respective platforms</strong>, framing it as targeting &#8220;one small business.&#8221; The tech companies had removed Parler for failing to follow their community guidelines over content and moderation after finding that the app had been used to plan, coordinate and facilitate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">The Washington Post covered a story</a> about how an App Store scammer stole a user&#8217;s life savings, $600,000, in bitcoin</strong>. The user believed the app was safe because Apple markets its App Store as trustworthy, but the app itself had been designed to trick users by pretending to be associated with Trezor, the maker of a hardware device used to store cryptocurrencies. The actual Trezor said it&#8217;s been notifying Apple and Google for years about fake apps that were scamming its customers, to no avail. The fake app got through App Review then changed itself to a crypto wallet without Apple&#8217;s knowledge.</p>

The rise of live audio has offered a potential threat to Spotify&#8217;s investment in podcasts, as it connects users to audio programming in real time, instead of through recorded and produced shows. Spotify had earlier said it would add interactivity to its Anchor podcast recording app to better connect podcasters and listeners, but with the Locker Room sale it&#8217;s taking a further step towards fully embracing live audio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/private-equity-a-spac-and-an-ipo-walk-into-a-bar/">this morning’s column</a>, Alex Wilhelm looked back on the last few months, “a busy season for technology exits” that followed a hot Q4 2020.</p>
<p>We’re seeing signs of an IPO market that may be cooling, but even so, “there are sufficient SPACs to take the entire recent Y Combinator class public,” he notes.</p>
<p>Once we factor in private equity firms with pockets full of money, it’s evident that late-stage companies have three solid choices for leveling up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Seeking more insight into these liquidity options, Alex interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill, whose company went public via IPO.</li>
<li>Latch CFO Garth Mitchell, who discussed his startup’s merger with real estate SPAC $TSIA.</li>
<li>Brian Cruver, founder and CEO of AlertMedia, which recently sold to a private equity firm.</li>
</ul>
<p>After recapping their deals, each executive explains how their company determined which flashing red “EXIT” sign to follow. As Alex observed, &#8220;choosing which option is best from a buffet’s worth of possibilities is an interesting task.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch! Have a great weekend.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, we published a four-part series on Tonal, a home fitness startup that has raised $200 million since it launched in 2018. The company&#8217;s patented hardware combines digital weights, coaching and AI in a wall-mounted system that sells for $2,995.</p>
<p>By any measure, it is poised for success — <strong>sales increased 800%</strong> between December 2019 and 2020, and by the end of this year, the company will have 60 retail locations. On Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/strength-training-startup-tonal-crosses-unicorn-status-after-raising-250m/">Tonal reported a $250 million Series E</a> that valued the company at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Our deep dive examines Tonal&#8217;s origins, product development timeline, its go-to-market strategy and other aspects that combined to spark investor interest and customer delight.</p>
<p>We call this format the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec-1/">EC-1</a>,&#8221; since these stories are as comprehensive and illuminating as the S-1 forms startups must file with the SEC before going public.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the Tonal EC-1 breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">How a homegrown experiment became one of the fastest-growing companies in fitness tech</a></li>
<li>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">Millions of dollars and 3.5 years, and it all came down to this</a></li>
<li>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">Building online communities for fun, profit and product</a></li>
<li>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-future/">Can Tonal become the luxury fitness market champion?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have more EC-1s in the works about other late-stage startups that are doing big things well and making news in the process.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation came to the fore during the pandemic as companies took steps to digitally transform. When employees couldn’t be in the same office together, it became crucial to cobble together more automated workflows that required fewer people in the loop.</p>
<p>RPA has enabled executives to provide a level of automation that essentially buys them time to update systems to more modern approaches while reducing the large number of mundane manual tasks that are part of every industry’s workflow.</p>

<p>Many organizations perceive data management as being akin to data governance, where responsibilities are centered around establishing controls and audit procedures, and things are viewed from a defensive lens.</p>
<p>That defensiveness is admittedly justified, particularly given the potential financial and reputational damages caused by data mismanagement and leakage.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s an element of myopia here, and being excessively cautious can prevent organizations from realizing the benefits of data-driven collaboration, particularly when it comes to software and product development.</p>

<p>There’s certainly no shortage of SaaS performance metrics leaders focus on, but NRR (net revenue retention) is without question the most underrated metric out there.</p>
<p>NRR is simply total revenue minus any revenue churn plus any revenue expansion from upgrades, cross-sells or upsells. The greater the NRR, the quicker companies can scale.</p>

<p>Cities are bustling hubs where people live, work and play. When the pandemic hit, some people fled major metropolitan markets for smaller towns — raising questions about the future validity of cities.</p>
<p>But those who predicted that COVID-19 would destroy major urban communities might want to stop shorting the resilience of these municipalities and start going long on what the post-pandemic future looks like.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of uncertainty surrounding copyright issues, fraud and adult content, and legal implications are the crux of the NFT trend.</p>
<p>Whether a court would protect the receipt-holder’s ownership over a given file depends on a variety of factors. All of these concerns mean artists may need to lawyer up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Woody Sears has long been interested in storytelling. Following the debut in 2007 of the first iPhone, he founded a storytelling app called Zuuka that built up a library of narrated and illustrated kids’ books for the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Sears later <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/61408-cupcake-digital-acquires-zuuka-and-its-istorytime-library-app.html">sold</a> that company to a small New York-based outfit. But Sears, who is based in Santa Barbara, California, isn’t done with stories yet. Instead, he just raised $1.6 million in seed funding for his second and newest storytelling startup, <a href="https://hearhere.com/">HearHere</a>, a subscription-based audio road-trip app that, with users&#8217; permission, pushes information to them as they’re driving, giving them informational tidbits in three- to five-minute segments about their surroundings, including points of interest they might not have been aware of at all.</p>
<p>The idea is to surface the unknown or forgotten history of regions, which makes sense in a world where <a href="https://www.aftermarketnews.com/overheard-long-distance-road-trips-increase-yoy/">more people</a> have returned to road trips and parents have grown desperate to pull their kids&#8217; attention away from TikTok. In fact, Sears’s neighbor, Kevin Costner, liked the idea so much that he recently joined its five-person team as a co-founder and narrator and investor, along with Snap Inc., the law firm Cooley, Camping World CEO and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/the-profit/">reality TV star</a> Marcus Lemonis, AAA and numerous other individual investors, including from NextGen Venture Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Because we, too, like history and road trips (and okay, fine, Kevin Costner), we talked with Sears and Costner earlier today to learn why they think they&#8217;ll succeed with HearHere when other content-rich geo-location based apps have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour/">fallen short</a> of meaningful adoption.</p>
<p>Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re creating an audio map of the U.S., so how many stories do you have banked as we speak?</strong></p>
<p>WS: We&#8217;re up to 5,500 stories across 22 states, and we&#8217;ll be nationwide by summer. The mission is to connect people to the places that they&#8217;re traveling through, lending people stories about the history, the natural wonders and the colorful characters who&#8217;ve lived in that area. We also do stories about sports and music and provide local insights.</p>
<p><strong>TC: That&#8217;s a lot of content to gather up, edit down, then record. What does the process look like? </strong></p>
<p>WS: At the end of the day, the content is king, and we take great care with these stories, producing them with a team of 22 researchers, writers, editors and narrators, most whom come from a travel journalism background. We really feel like we get the best end result through that team approach.</p>
<p>Eventually, we&#8217;ll open up to third-party content contributors, where we&#8217;re hosting both professional content and also user-generated content.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there an AI component or will there be?</strong></p>
<p>WS: We more see this as augmented reality in that these stories really do overlay the landscape and give you a different perspective while traveling. But AI and machine learning are things that we&#8217;ll incorporate as we start to move into foreign languages and better tailor the content for the end user.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you prioritize which stories to tell as you&#8217;re building up this content library?</strong></p>
<p>WS: The major historical markers are a big inspiration, but we&#8217;re looking for those lesser-known gems, too, and we look at travel patterns &#8212; the way that people move when they&#8217;re on leisure trips, meaning what interstate highways they&#8217;re taking and which scenic routes are most popular.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How does the subscription piece work?</strong></p>
<p>WS: You get five free free stories each month; for unlimited streaming, it&#8217;s $35.99 per year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Kevin, you must be approached a lot with startup ideas and investment opportunities. Why get so involved with this one?</strong></p>
<p>KC: Obviously I&#8217;m story-oriented; that doesn&#8217;t come as a shock to anybody. But you&#8217;re right, a lot of ideas come to me.</p>
<p>HearHere came through my wife, who said that Woody had something he wanted to talk about, and as she explained it to me, I got it, you know? That&#8217;s the shiny thing for me, storytelling and having the ability for a good story to come out, especially when it comes to our country.</p>

<p>So we had this meeting and he explained the concept to me, which is kind of equal to what I&#8217;d already been doing my whole life, which is stopping at the bronze plaques all over the country and reading about their historical significance &#8212; those [moments] that kind of interrupt everybody&#8217;s trip except mine. [Laughs.] You know, [it&#8217;s] getting out and stretching my legs and reading a little history and dreaming while the rest of the people in the car are kind of moaning because we stopped our progress.</p>
<p>This [product] is an extension of that for me, without getting out of the car, and with stories that can evolve and perhaps get longer. And I can become more involved in what I was driving past and the people in the car can maybe sense what it was that interested me enough to stop.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You love history. </strong></p>
<p>KC: HearHere is a lot more than history, but for me, it was the history [that I found so compelling]. And it&#8217;s how the foundation was set for me to become more involved in the company and understand it a lot better and then become somebody who wanted to be a part of the founding of it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: AAA and Camping World are among the company&#8217;s strategic investors. How might they promote the app and what other partnerships have you struck to get HearHere in front of people at the right time?</strong></p>
<p>WS: Camping World also owns Good Sam Club, which is the largest organization of RV owners in the world, and AAA is a giant with 57 million members in the U.S., and they all see this as a way to fulfill something they&#8217;re aren&#8217;t currently doing for their audience; it&#8217;s making that bridge to digital, and we&#8217;re really excited to get this in front of their members and customers.</p>
<p>We also have partnerships with [the RV marketplaces] Outdoorsy and RVshare [and the RV rental and sales company] Cruise America. It&#8217;s a very hot market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: There have been similar ideas. Caterina Fake&#8217;s <a href="https://findery.com/">Findery</a> was an early app that aimed to help users discover much more about locations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/bose-acquires-andrew-masons-walking-tour-startup-detour/">Detour</a>, a startup that provided walking audio tours of cities that was founded by Groupon co-founder Andrew Mason, seemed interesting but failed to take off with users. What makes you think this startup will click?</strong></p>
<p>WS: I loved Detour. I ate up both of those.</p>
<p>I guess where I think [Detour] missed product-market fit was the number of scenarios where you could use it and also, it was competing for people&#8217;s time. We chose to start with road trips because you have a captive audience; there&#8217;s only so much you can do when you&#8217;re driving in the car, unlike when you&#8217;re in a city, where there are all kinds of options to explore its history, including physical books and tour guides. You also had to carve out two hours of your time, and it&#8217;s easy to get distracted while you&#8217;re walking around.</p>
<p>We want to capture the places that are along the journey and lesser known and more untold and where people have the space to engage in it. Starting as short form helps. It&#8217;s also on-demand, so you don&#8217;t have to follow a pre-designated route. We&#8217;re not taking you on a specific tour, where you have to turn left or turn right. We&#8217;re going to surface stories for you no matter what route you take.</p>

		Leslie Feinzaig is the founder and CEO of the <a href="https://femalefounders.org/">Female Founders Alliance</a>.
	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital has a diversity problem: <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/2020-diversity-spotlight-report/">Data</a> show that Black and Latinx founders received just 2.6% of overall funding in 2020. Women-founded teams <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">received nearly 30% less</a> funding in 2020 than they did in 2019.</p>
<p>For decades, a close-knit community of brilliant but like-minded individuals built a system of pattern recognition. It produced high-growth companies with homogenous leadership teams. They called it meritocracy. Those of us who didn’t fit the profile were told, or were left to assume, that we didn’t have what it takes.</p>
<p>When a founder needs funding but investors don’t think they “have what it takes,” it can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. No matter how good you are and how much product-market fit you achieve, at some point “what it takes” to scale a company is money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Until recently, the lack of diversity in the ecosystem was largely an issue to those of us directly affected by it. It wasn’t until the groundbreaking #metoo and #BlackLivesMatter movements that the lack of funding for women and minorities became both evident &#8212; and evidently problematic &#8212; to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I believe that underrepresented founders are the most undervalued asset class in the U.S. today, and investors are starting to realize that diversity is not charity &#8212; it’s economic opportunity.</p>
<p>Just look at the data on women-founded startups, which deliver 63% higher ROI (according to First Round Capital), generate twice as much revenue for every dollar invested (according to BCG), and take one full year less time to exit (according to PitchBook &amp; AllRaise). Founders that have it harder, but persevere, lead to stronger companies with outsized results for their investors.</p>
<p>The good news is that recent events jolted many into action. A flurry of pledges, micro-funds and quick investments in support of Black founders arrived in the wake of George Floyd’s murder last summer. Overnight, these founders were heavily courted for meetings and speaking opportunities from people and firms they didn’t have access to in the past. Some secured investments and built new relationships that will help down the line. For many, the timing was off, and they didn’t benefit materially. In the end, the frenzy quieted down, and only 3% of 2020 VC deal volume went to Black-founded companies.</p>
<p>Ashlee Wisdom, the co-founder and CEO of digital health platform <a href="https://healthinherhue.com/">Health in Her HUE</a>, experienced this firsthand.</p>
<p>“Last summer I was overwhelmed with inbounds from investors, which felt great at first,” she said. “But I was new to venture; I didn’t know how to build a strategy around fundraising, and most of those investors were looking for companies at a later stage than mine. No one I spoke to during that time seemed to be willing to invest in my pre-seed round despite our demonstrated traction. On the positive side, I met a lot of great investors who made meaningful introductions to pre-seed and early-stage funds. And some of those later-stage investors are now watching Health In Her HUE’s progress.”</p>
<p>It’s too soon to tell how sustainable the progress made last year will be. But we do have evidence from prior times that small, cosmetic efforts at diversity do not result in lasting change. Just take a look at what’s happened to VC funding for women recently.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of #metoo, investors and corporations were also spurred to act, with some success. For a while, VC investments in women-founded companies increased slowly but steadily. But once COVID hit, and investors retreated to their closest and most trusted referral networks, VC funding for women took a huge step backward. Crunchbase data show more than 800 female-founded startups globally received a total of $4.9 billion in venture funding in 2020, through mid-December, representing a 27% decrease over the same period the prior year.</p>
<p>The lesson is this: Efforts at the periphery of venture capital do not make a difference in the long run. The good news is many have started taking action. To achieve systemic, long-term improvements, VC firms will need to make changes to their core system, building diversity into the primary investing process itself. Results will not be visible immediately, but they will be far more sustainable and, as the data suggest, more profitable over the lifetime of these funds. Here are three specific actions VC firms can take to achieve this:</p>
<h2>1. Hire BIPOC and women investors</h2>
<p>A recent<a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem"> PitchBook</a> report notes that female investors are twice as likely to invest in companies with female founders and three times as likely in companies with female CEOs. And yet fewer than 10% of all VC partners are women. According to BLCK VC, more than 80% of venture firms don’t have a single Black investor on their team. That makes it less surprising that only 1 percent of venture-funded startup founders are Black.</p>
<p>When you hire from the same communities you want to invest in, and ensure your new hires are set up for success, you unlock dealflow, relationships, and insights into new markets and customer sets. This results in a more diverse portfolio and a stronger investment team, one that serves its entire portfolio of companies better.</p>
<h2>2. Measure the top of your funnel</h2>
<p>Inputs lead to outputs. VC firms should do everything they can to foster stronger relationships with underrepresented founder communities to enable more diversity at the top of the deal flow funnel.</p>
<p>Partner, sponsor and invest in organizations like <a href="www.femalefounders.org">Female Founders Alliance, SoGal Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.blackwomentalktech.com/">Black Women Talk Tech</a> and more. Go out of your way to attend events, ask for introductions, schedule casual coffee meetings and meet as many founders in those networks as you can &#8212; and foster those relationships meaningfully over time. This is how you seed decades of great dealflow.</p>
<h2>3. Invest directly in emerging fund managers</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of new funds, many of them with less than $50 million in assets under management, with direct access to pockets of talent that you are not currently seeing. These general partners have trusting, authentic relationships with founders who might be wary of mainstream VC. If you are a larger VC fund, you should be actively investing in them. Emerging managers can act as your scouts, and, in return, you will help build the ecosystem itself.</p>
<p>I believe that the lack of diversity in venture capital is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for those willing to make the earliest bets. If we invest in women at the same rate that we invest in men, this could boost the global economy by up to $5 trillion. That is a huge amount of return up for grabs. A homogenous portfolio misses that opportunity.</p>
<p>Most investors I know are aware of the opportunity and genuinely want to do better. The more urgency they feel, the more likely they are to spin up independent initiatives to address inequities directly. While these can be helpful, they’re also not sustainable. The best way to build a sustainably diverse portfolio is to do the slow, hard work of change from the inside out.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The cyber world has entered a new era in which attacks are becoming more frequent and happening on a larger scale than ever before. Massive hacks affecting thousands of high-level American companies and agencies have dominated the news recently. Chief among these are the December SolarWinds/FireEye breach and the more recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">Microsoft Exchange server breach</a>. Everyone wants to know: If you’ve been hit with the Exchange breach, what should you do?</p>
<p>To answer this question, and compare security philosophies, we outlined what we&#8217;d do &#8212; side by side. One of us is a career attacker (David Wolpoff), and the other a CISO with experience securing companies in the healthcare and security spaces (Aaron Fosdick).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Don’t wait for your incident response team to take the brunt of a cyberattack on your organization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>CISO Aaron Fosdick</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Back up your system. </strong></h3>
<p>A hacker’s likely going to throw some ransomware attacks at you after breaking into your mail server. So rely on your backups, configurations, etc. Back up everything you can. But back up to an instance before the breach. Design your backups with the assumption that an attacker will try to delete them. Don’t use your normal admin credentials to encrypt your backups, and make sure your admin accounts can’t delete or modify backups once they’ve been created. Your backup target should not be part of your domain.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Assume compromise and stop connectivity if necessary.</strong></h3>
<p>Identify if and where you have been compromised. Inspect your systems forensically to see if any systems are using your surface as a launch point and attempting to move laterally from there. If your Exchange server is indeed compromised, you want it off your network as soon as possible. Disable external connectivity to the internet to ensure they cannot exfiltrate any data or communicate with other systems in the network, which is how attackers move laterally.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Consider deploying default/deny.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether pure-play RPA will survive as a category remains to be seen, but it will likely be around for a long time under the intelligent process automation umbrella.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When UIPath <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">filed its S-1 last week</a>, it was a watershed moment for the robotic process automation (RPA) market. The company, which first appeared on our radar for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/uipath-raises-30m-to-build-software-robots-for-internal-business-tasks/">a $30 million Series A</a> in 2017, has so far raised an astonishing $2 billion while still private. In February, it was valued at $35 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">when it raised $750 million</a> in its latest round.</p>
<p>RPA and process automation came to the fore during the pandemic as companies took steps to digitally transform. When employees couldn&#8217;t be in the same office together, it became crucial to cobble together more automated workflows that required fewer people in the loop.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>When UIPath raised money in 2017, RPA was not well known in enterprise software circles even though it had already been around for several years. The category was gaining in popularity by that point because it addressed automation in a legacy context. That meant companies with deep legacy technology — practically everyone not born in the cloud — could automate across older platforms without ripping and replacing, an expensive and risky undertaking that most CEOs would rather not take.</p>
<p>RPA has enabled executives to provide a level of workflow automation, a taste of the modern. It essentially buys them time to update systems to more modern approaches while reducing the large number of mundane manual tasks that are part of just about every industry&#8217;s workflow.</p>
<p>While some people point to RPA as job-elimination software, it also provides a way to liberate people from some of the most mind-numbing and mundane chores in the organization. The argument goes that this frees up employees for higher level tasks.</p>
<p>As an example, RPA could take advantage of older workflow technologies like OCR (optical character recognition) to read a number from a form, enter the data in a spreadsheet, generate an invoice, send it for printing and mailing, and generate a Slack message to the accounting department that the task has been completed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to take a deep dive into RPA and the larger process automation space — explore the market size and dynamics, look at the key players and the biggest investors, and finally, try to chart out where this market might go in the future.</p>
<h2>Meet the vendors</h2>
<p>UIPath is clearly an RPA star with a significant market share lead of 27.1%, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US45411620">according to IDC</a>. Automation Anywhere is in second place with 19.4%, and Blue Prism is third with 10.3%, based on data from IDC&#8217;s July 2020 report, the last time the firm reported on the market.</p>
<p>Two other players with significant market share worth mentioning are WorkFusion with 6.8%, and NTT with 5%.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-border payments startup </span><a href="http://www.dlocal.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dLocal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $150 million at a $5 billion valuation, less than seven months after securing $200 million at a $1.2 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the five-year-old Uruguayan company has effectively quadrupled its valuation in a matter of months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alkeon Capital led the latest round, which also included participation from BOND, D1 Capital Partners and Tiger Global. General Atlantic led its previous </span><a href="https://dlocal.com/press-release/latin-america-newest-unicorn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which closed last September and made dLocal Uruguay’s first unicorn and one of Latin American’s highest-valued startups.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLocal connects global enterprise merchants with “billions” of emerging market consumers in 29 countries across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. More than 325 global merchants, including e-commerce retailers, SaaS companies, online travel providers and marketplaces use dLocal to accept over 600 local payment methods. They also use its platform to issue payments to their contractors, agents and sellers. Some of dLocal’s customers include Amazon, Booking.com, Dropbox, GoDaddy, MailChimp, Microsoft, Spotify, TripAdvisor, Uber and Zara. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with this latest round, dLocal has named Sumita Pandit to the role of COO. Pandit is former global head of fintech and managing director for JP Morgan, and also worked at Goldman Sachs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sumita is a highly respected and accomplished fintech investment banker, and she&#8217;s played a pivotal role advising some of the world&#8217;s most successful fintech companies as they&#8217;ve scaled to become global leaders,”  said dLocal CEO Sebastián Kanovich in a written statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, former COO Jacobo Singer has been promoted to president of dLocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to enhance its technology and continue to expand geographically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alkeon General Partner Deepak Ravichandran believes that emerging markets represent some of the fastest growth opportunities in digital payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, as global merchants look to access these markets, they are often faced with a complex web of local payment methods, cross-border regulations, and other operational roadblocks,” he said in a written statement. “dLocal’s unique platform empowers merchants with a single integrated payment solution, to reach billions of customers, accept payments, send payouts, and settle funds globally.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Choosing which option is best from a buffet's worth of possibilities is an interesting task for startup CEOs and their boards.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first quarter of 2021 was a busy season for technology exits. Coming off a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/looking-ahead-to-2021-venture-fundraising-liquidity-and-the-everything-bubble/">hot period</a> in the final quarter of 2020, it was no surprise that tech upstarts pursued liquidity through a variety of mechanisms as the new year began.</p>
<p>There were IPOs, there were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">direct listings</a>, there <a href="https://www.saastr.com/rise-private-equity-saas-gift-founders/">were PE deals</a>. Hell, we even saw enough SPACs that we lost track of a few; amid all the noise, you&#8217;ll miss the occasional note no matter how well-tuned your ear.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Each path is still open for later-stage startups to pursue exits: The IPO market was welcoming until a few minutes ago and private equity firms are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">stacked with cash</a> and willing to pay higher multiples than they might in more normal times. And there are sufficient SPACs to take the entire recent Y Combinator class public.</p>
<p>Choosing which option is best from a buffet&#8217;s worth of possibilities is an interesting task for startup CEOs and their boards.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>DigitalOcean <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/a-look-at-4-ipo-updates-and-2-late-stage-funding-rounds/">went public via a traditional IPO</a>, raising a slug of capital in the process. The SMB-focused public cloud company likely felt like a somewhat obvious IPO candidate when you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/olo-raises-ipo-range-as-digitalocean-sees-possible-5b-debut-valuation/">read its results</a>. The Exchange spoke with the company&#8217;s CEO, Yancey Spruill, about the choice.</p>
<p>Latch, in contrast, decided that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">a SPAC was its best route </a>out the gate. The Exchange caught up with the company&#8217;s CFO, Garth Mitchell, about the transaction and why it made sense for his company.</p>
<p>And, finally, The Exchange spoke with AlertMedia&#8217;s founder and CEO, Brian Cruver, about his decision to sell his Texas-based company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005118/en/AlertMedia-Receives-Strategic-Growth-Investment-From-Vista-Equity-Partners">to a private equity firm</a>.</p>
<p>To prevent this post from reaching an astronomic word count, we&#8217;ll give a brief overview of each deal and then summarize the company&#8217;s views about why their liquidity choice was the right one.</p>
<h2>Three paths to liquidity</h2>
<p>Kicking off with DigitalOcean, a few notes: First, the company has been pretty darn public about its growth in the last few years. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/digitalocean-raises-100m-in-debt-as-it-scales-towards-revenue-of-300m-profitability/">knew</a> that it had an annualized run rate of around $200 million in 2018, $250 million in 2019 and around $300 million in the first half of 2020. It later announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z/">hit that mark</a> in May of last year.</p>
<p>So when DigitalOcean decided to go public, we weren&#8217;t bowled over. The company wound up pricing at $47 per share, the high end of its range. Since then, its stock has struggled somewhat, falling below $37 per share before recovering to $43.80 at the end of trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Enough of all that. Why did the company choose to go public via a traditional IPO? Spruill said his company looked at SPAC deals and direct listings. It selected the IPO route because it fit the company&#8217;s goals of generating a broad base of shareholders while creating a branding opportunity.</p>
<p>The cost of an IPO is comparable, he added, to other exit options. Spruill also praised the IPO process itself, noting that its rigorous requirements made DigitalOcean a better company.</p>
<p>Earlier in our chat, I asked Spruill a question that I put to every CEO on IPO day: <em>How are you feeling?</em> It&#8217;s a bit of a sop, but it sometimes elicits insights from executives and founders who, after weeks of discussing their companies&#8217; inner workings, are asked a rare personal question.</p>
<p>Spruill said he felt incredible and that nothing could replicate an IPO as the culmination of so much work put into building a company and its team. If you add up the wins and losses over time, with more of the former than the latter, and can cross the finish line with the right metrics and market, you can earn a spot to be &#8220;grilled&#8221; by the &#8220;best investors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Those investors put $750 million or so into his company, Spruill added. Funds that it can use to retire debt and free up more cash flow. Not a bad day, I&#8217;d say.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple has announced an expansion for its subscription gaming service Apple Arcade. In addition to exclusive game releases, the company is adding two new categories — Timeless Classics and App Store Greats.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-arcade-expands-its-award-winning-catalog-to-more-than-180-games/">has announced</a> an expansion for its subscription gaming service <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>. In addition to exclusive game releases, the company is adding two new categories — Timeless Classics and App Store Greats.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;App Store Greats&#8221; category, you can find some well-known iPhone games that have been released over the past decade, such as Threes+, Mini Metro+, Monument Valley+, Fruit Ninja Classic+, Cut the Rope Remastered and Badland+.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move, as Apple has focused on exclusive titles so far. Arguably, some Apple Arcade games are sequels of popular App Store games — I’d put Mini Motorways and Rayman Mini in this category, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Apple is changing its stance and essentially buying a back catalog of App Store games. Some of them are still available on the App Store, while others have become incompatible with modern iOS versions due to framework and hardware updates. 64-bit processors have rendered many games incompatible for instance.</p>
<p>As always, Apple isn’t just putting free games behind a paywall. These are brand new downloads on the App Store. You get the full game without any ad or in-app purchase.</p>
<p>In addition to old school App Store games, Apple is also adding &#8220;Timeless Classics&#8221; games. It’s a selection of board games and classic puzzle games that are included in your subscription. Games include Backgammon+, Chess Play &amp; Learn+, Good Sudoku+, Tiny Crossword+, etc.</p>
<p>Those games should definitely help when it comes to reducing churn. Some people just like playing chess over and over again. They might start subscribing to play some chess and pay an Apple Arcade subscription just to keep using the same app.</p>

<p>Overall, Apple is dropping 32 games today, and Apple Arcade has more than 180 games in its catalog. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/apple-arcade-is-now-available-for-some-ios-13-beta-users/">originally launched</a> the service in September 2019. You can download Apple Arcade games for $4.99 per month and there’s no additional in-app purchases. Games are available on the iPhone, the iPad, the Apple TV and macOS. Up to six family members can play with a single Apple Arcade subscription and you can also access Apple Arcade with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/apple-one-services-subscription-bundles-start-launching-tomorrow/">Apple One subscription</a>.</p>

<p>Apple has been betting heavily on subscription services, such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+ and Apple News+. While some of those services have been very successful, such as Apple Music, the company is still adding more and more content to other services to prove that you should subscribe over the long haul. And today’s Apple Arcade update should definitely help for its game subscription service.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. It was a busy week on the IPO front, Danny was buried in getting the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">Tonal EC-1</a> out, and Natasha took some time off. But the host trio managed to prep and record a show that was honestly a kick to record, and we think, a pleasure to listen to!</p>

<p>So, for your morning walk, here&#8217;s what we have for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">The Substack conversation</a>:</strong> Does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/substack-confirms-65m-raise-promises-to-rapidly-expand-its-financial-backing-of-newly-independent-writers/">the new $65 million check</a> make sense? What is Substack? Does it have a moat? Why is <a href="https://natasha.substack.com/">Natasha&#8217;s URL</a> so much better than <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/">Alex&#8217;s</a>?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">Cameo raised $100 million</a> and none of us really have a bone to pick with that. Danny actually argues in favor of it.</li>
<li><strong>The Clubhouse conversation:</strong> Does every single product need to feature live audio? The answer appears to be yes, oddly enough. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> comes up along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify</a>, as does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn.</a> And somehow, Microsoft Excel and Miami?</li>

<li>Harlem Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">raises $134 million for its new fund.</a></li>

</ul>
<p>It was a mix of laughs, &#8216;aha&#8217; moments and honest conversations about how complex ambition in startups should be. One listener the other day mentioned to us that the pandemic made it harder to carve out time for podcasts, since listening was often reserved for commutes. We get it, and in true scrappy fashion, we&#8217;re curious how you&#8217;ve adapted to remote work and podcasts. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Let us know </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">how you tune into Equity via Twitter</a> and remember that we&#8217;re thankful for your ears!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mike Barile spent two years and racked up nearly $20,000 in credit card debt to bring his first startup, <a href="https://www.backflip.com/">Backflip</a>, to life.</p>
<p>The former management consultant had spent years toiling in the startup grind, first at Uber, then, after taking a coding academy bootcamp through <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> (where Barile met his co-founder, Adam Foosaner), at Google and at a failed cryptocurrency startup.</p>
<p>Burned by the crypto experience, Barile was casting about for his next thing, and trying to find a way to scrape up some rent money, when he hit on the idea for Backflip. The experience of selling electronics online was still shady and Barile and Foosaner thought there had to be a better way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That way became Backflip. It offers customers cash on delivery for their used electronics &#8212; anything from Androids to Xboxes and Apple devices to Game Boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started working on backflip back in March 2019, I met this kid named Chris and he wanted to buy some of my old iPhones. He had been a student at USF and as a side hustle he started buying used devices and would refurbish them and then either sell them himself or sell them to an official reseller,&#8221; said Barile. &#8220;Chris started making so much money he dropped out of school. That was a &#8216;holy shit&#8217; moment. He can make a lot of money doing this and he’s doing a really good thing.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p>The problem, said Barile, was safety. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s got all these devices he’s acquiring paying cash for and he’s driving all around town… Everyone who works in the [refurbish and resell] industry has at least one story about getting robbed at gunpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Backflip solved that problem by being the intermediary between buyers and sellers and taking a small commission for managing the transaction.</p>
<p>The company raised its first money at the end of 2019, but before that, Foosaner and Barile lived off of credit and used electronics.</p>
<p>So far, Backflip has facilitated the exchange of roughly 3,000 devices. The company handles everything from wiping a device and ensuring its quality to finding a buyer for the electronics. The company pays out roughly $150 per device and has deposited a little over $500,000 with users of the service, according to data provided by the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did all sorts of stuff to get our first few users,&#8221; said Barile. We posted ads on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. We started experimenting at the end of the summer with the most bare-bones mobile app kind of thing. At that point it was just Adam and I,&#8221; Barile said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 5 biggest mistakes I made as a first-time startup founder&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/the-5-biggest-mistakes-i-made-as-a-first-time-startup-founder/embed/#?secret=YWTYWt8Btr" data-secret="YWTYWt8Btr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Starting now, Backflip is working with UPS stores to provide in-person drop-off and packaging centers for the used electronics. Over time, Barile sees those services expanding to offer cash on delivery. &#8220;The experience will be similar to an Amazon return,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Except we&#8217;ll be paying you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently about half of the company&#8217;s inventory is used handsets and mobile devices, but Barile said that could drop to a third of inventory as word spreads about the hundred-odd pieces of electronics that Backflip is willing to accept.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike other resale options, Backflip prioritizes the user’s time and convenience,” said Foosaner in a statement</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Forget the back-and-forth of negotiating over price and scheduling a meetup. We’re here to do all the work for the seller and make sure they get paid fairly and quickly. Backflip users can know that they’re getting the most for their devices without having to do anything other than bring them to The UPS Store or box them up at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The connection to the refurbishing community started early for Barile, whose mother had a side business called &#8220;Stone Cottage Workshop&#8221; where she was flipping refurbished furniture on eBay and at local thrift stores near Barile&#8217;s bucolic New Jersey hometown.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to build the Amazon of making things disappear from your apartment,&#8221; Barile said. </span></p>
