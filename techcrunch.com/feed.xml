He holds a Ph.D. in Business Administration (as well as an M.Sc. and B.Sc.) from Stockholm School of Economics, and a Civil Engineering degree in Engineering Physics with an M.Sc. in AI and machine learning from KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A little over a decade has passed since <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2010/02/25/the-data-deluge">The Economist warned us</a> that we would soon be drowning in data. The modern data stack has emerged as a proposed life-jacket for this data flood — spearheaded by Silicon Valley startups such as Snowflake, Databricks and Confluent.</p>
<p>Today, any entrepreneur can sign up for BigQuery or Snowflake and have a data solution that can scale with their business in a matter of hours. The emergence of cheap, flexible and scalable data storage solutions was largely a response to changing needs spurred by the massive explosion of data.</p>
<p>Currently, the world produces<a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/#:~:text=But%20if%20we're%20talking,1.145%20trillion%20MB%20per%20day."> 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily</a> (there are 18 zeros in a quintillion). The explosion of data continues in the roaring ‘20s, both in terms of generation and storage — the amount of stored data is <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/stored-data-doubling-every-4-years-idc-says/">expected to continue to double at least every four years</a>. However, one integral part of modern data infrastructure still lacks solutions suitable for the Big Data era and its challenges: Monitoring of data quality and data validation.</p>
<p>Let me go through how we got here and the challenges ahead for data quality.</p>
<h2>The value vs. volume dilemma of Big Data</h2>
<p>In 2005, Tim O’Reilly published his groundbreaking article &#8220;What is Web 2.0?&#8221;, truly setting off the Big Data race. The same year, Roger Mougalas from O’Reilly introduced the term &#8220;Big Data&#8221; in its modern context  —  referring to a large set of data that is virtually impossible to manage and process using traditional BI tools.</p>
<p>Back in 2005, one of the biggest challenges with data was managing large volumes of it, as data infrastructure tooling was expensive and inflexible, and the cloud market was still in its infancy (AWS didn’t publicly launch until 2006). The other was speed: As Tristan Handy from Fishtown Analytics (the company behind dbt) <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/">notes</a>, before Redshift launched in 2012, performing relatively straightforward analyses could be incredibly time-consuming even with medium-sized data sets. An entire data tooling ecosystem has since been created to mitigate these two problems.</p>

<p>Scaling relational databases and data warehouse appliances used to be a real challenge. Only 10 years ago, a company that wanted to understand customer behavior had to buy and rack servers before its engineers and data scientists could work on generating insights. Data and its surrounding infrastructure was expensive, so only the biggest companies could afford large-scale data ingestion and storage.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The challenge before us is to ensure that the large volumes of Big Data are of sufficiently high quality before they&#8217;re used.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Then came a (Red)shift. In October 2012, AWS presented the first viable solution to the scale challenge with Redshift — a cloud-native, massively parallel processing (MPP) database that anyone could use for a monthly price of a pair of sneakers ($100) — about 1,000x cheaper than the previous &#8220;local-server&#8221; setup. With a price drop of this magnitude, the floodgates opened and every company, big or small, could now store and process massive amounts of data and unlock new opportunities.</p>
<p>As Jamin Ball from Altimeter Capital <a href="https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-dataops-and-the-analytical">summarizes</a>, Redshift was a big deal because it was the first cloud-native OLAP warehouse and reduced the cost of owning an OLAP database by orders of magnitude. The speed of processing analytical queries also increased dramatically. And later on (Snowflake pioneered this), they separated computing and storage, which, in overly simplified terms, meant customers could scale their storage and computing resources independently.</p>
<p>What did this all mean? An explosion of data collection and storage.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renovating a home is an exciting, yet often fraught-filled, endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup that aims to help make the process simpler, cheaper and less stressful by helping people manage the home renovation process has raised $6 million to help it grow even faster. Builders VC led the round, which included participation from Celtic, Newfund and Wish co-founder Danny Zhang, who also sits on Eano&#8217;s board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stella Wu, who formerly worked as a growth product manager at Wish, got firsthand experience of the pain points related to the process when she bought her own house in 2017.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized there were a lot of fragmented issues in the renovation space, especially when it came to the individual workers,” she recalls. “They were not reliable and bad at communication.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2019 she founded </span><a href="https://www.eano.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to walk a homeowner through a renovation and help connect individual contractors with new clients. Eano also works on projects like building ADUs (accessory dwelling units).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more people spent time at home last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the startup saw its contract revenue spike by 5x, Wu says. And in the first quarter of this year, business was up 70% year over year.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155455" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155455" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2155455 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="270" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg 1470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?resize=768,692 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?resize=680,613 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_2597.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eano CEO and founder Stella Wu / Eano</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eano, she said, offers competitive and transparent pricing so that homeowners aren’t surprised as a remodeling project goes on. Its automated process tracks all communications and progress in one place and the company has grown what it describes as a “network of experienced, local professionals” that are fully licensed, vetted and insured that it pairs homeowners with on projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s all these individual contractors out there and even though they are very affordable, it’s very hard for them to get to the homeowners, as they don’t have much resources,” Wu, a Chinese immigrant, told TechCrunch. “So they come to us and we basically take care of it all.” For now, Eano is operating in the Bay Area and Los Angeles, with plans to expand to Seattle and Houston this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to take its new capital and “go deep into the product side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they become a client, homeowners can use Eano to select a certain remodeling package, and then they can check the project progress, communicate with the team and even see the progress through videos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re also helping contractors make communicating and receiving payment much easier,” Wu said. “We’re also helping these individual contractors increase the brand, and helping them with the administration and customer support side with our software.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Kim of Builders VC, said he first encountered Wu and Jung while they were at Wish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We invest in people, and when you can find extremely talented entrepreneurs who have built successful companies and still have the hunger to win, you jump in with a blank check,” he said. “We love Eano&#8217;s mission &#8212; combining a similar product sourcing strategy as Wish with technology to bring a better experience to all constituents in the antiquated construction industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim is also impressed by the fact that Wu is driven to prove “that you don&#8217;t need to be a 55-year-old man wearing steel-toed boots to have a meaningful impact on construction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We love that ethos &#8212; it matches with our thinking about backing entrepreneurs who don&#8217;t fit into the stereotypical box,” Kim said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A decade ago, <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong> was one-person startup in a garage. Today, the EV and technology company founded by Mate Rimac employs more than 1,000 people, has partnerships with Porsche and Hyundai Motor Group and is on track to launch its 1,914 hp, all-electric C_Two hypercar this year.</p>
<p>If that weren&#8217;t enough, Rimac also launched a subsidiary company Greyp Bikes to produce electrically assisted bicycles. It&#8217;s a notable run for a company that Mate Rimac founded after converting a 1984 BMW into an electric vehicle that at one time was the fastest in the world. What makes it remarkable is he started the company in Croatia and at time that lacked the typical network found in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years ago today, I was still like one guy in a garage and we did this in a location in Croatia where there is not a lot of technology or industry in general,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year. &#8220;So it was crazy, I didn&#8217;t have a single venture capital fund. There were no tech startups. There was no industry in general, not just like automotive, but industry as such. So, there was no talent, there were no buildings we could use. So, we had a very tough upcoming, and was very hard for us to start we were just surviving and, you know from month to month and trying to pay the bills and most of the times we were struggling with that so the first six or seven years of our life most of the time for me was focusing on keeping the company going and how the hell I&#8217;m going to pay the next payroll or the next rent and stuff like that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rimac overcame those challenges, gaining Porsche and Hyundai as investors and importantly, generating revenue from the beginning — and even profits.</p>
<p>And Mate Rimac isn&#8217;t done.</p>
<p>The founder and CEO recently unveiled a design for new headquarters in Croatia that will include an on-site test track, an R&amp;D and production facility, museum, gym and day care for employees and even an-site organic food production and farm animals. The complex, which is expected to be completed by 2023, will allow the company to ramp up from prototype and smaller projects to high-volume production of its high-performance electric drivetrain and battery systems for customers that include Porsche, Hyundai-Kia, SEAT, Renault and Pininfarina.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that Mate Rimac will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=rimacpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=Rimac&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong></a>, a one-day virtual event that is scheduled June 9. We have a lot of ground to cover with Mate Rimac from how he started a company outside of a traditional incubator or VC network, his upcoming electric hypercar and plans for the company&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>In case, you&#8217;re not familiar, each year we bring together engineers and founders, investors and CEOs who are working on all the present and future ways people and packages will get from Point A to Point B. The agenda is packed with leaders in electric vehicles — that would be Mate Rimac — autonomous vehicle technology, micromobility and even urban and regional air taxis.</p>
<p>Among the growing list of speakers are <strong>Motional</strong> President <strong>Karl Iagnemma</strong> and <strong>Aurora</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Chris Urmson</strong>, who will team up to talk about technical problems that remain to be solved, the war over talent, the best business models and applications of autonomous vehicles and maybe even hear a few stories from the early days of testing and launching a startup.</p>
<p>Other guests include <strong>GM</strong>&#8216;s VP of Global Innovation <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, <strong>Scale AI</strong> CEO <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and<strong> LinkedIn</strong> founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> (whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, <strong>Zoox</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer<strong> Tamika L. Butler</strong>, <strong>Remix</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and <strong>Revel</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p>We also recently announced a panel dedicated to China&#8217;s robotaxi industry. We&#8217;re bringing together three female leaders from Chinese autonomous vehicle startups that have an overseas footprint: <strong>Jewel Li</strong> from AutoX, which is backed by Chinese state-owned automakers Dongfeng Motor and SAIC Motor; <strong>Huan Sun</strong> from Momenta, which attracted Bosch, Daimler and Toyota in its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/"> $500 million round</a> closed in March; and <strong>Jennifer Li</strong> from WeRide, whose valuation jumped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">$3 billion</a> after a financing round in May.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait to book your tickets to TC Sessions: Mobility as prices go up at the door. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=rimacpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=Rimac&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grab your passes</a> right now and hear from today&#8217;s biggest mobility leaders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, that was fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai/">Just a few months after raising its seed round</a>, Unfolded.ai announced today that it is being acquired by Foursquare. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The startup had raised a total of about $6 million when we last checked in with them.</p>
<p>The company, founded by a group of ex-Uber geospatial engineers, was building on top of popular open-source libraries that its founders had created including <a href="https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a>, a web application that can take geospatial datasets and visualize them, and <a href="https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl">Deck.gl</a>, which offers an extensible application framework for processing geospatial datasets and preparing them for visualization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As I wrote earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>The startup’s main product is called <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai/blog/2021-01-12-introducing-studio/">Unfolded Studio</a>, which acts as a backend-as-a-service for applications built on top of <a href="http://Kepler.gl">Kepler.gl</a> (which is only a frontend library itself) handling components like data management and server communications. In particular, the product is designed to bring different geospatial datasets together and allow them all to interact with each other in one unified view.</p></blockquote>
<p>The acquisition by Foursquare is designed to bring Unfolded’s geospatial technology into <a href="https://foursquare.com/article/a-new-look-and-feel-introducing-foursquare-everywhere/">Foursquare Everywhere</a>, the company’s new brand and product focus on delivering scalable location services to all sorts of customers.</p>
<p>Foursquare has evolved significantly in recent years to become a location-focused advertising and marketing platform. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/">announced that it was merging with Factual</a> back in April 2020, and switched out CEO David Shim <a href="https://foursquare.com/article/foursquare-ceo-david-shim-to-depart-company-gary/">with Gary Little in November</a>, who assumed the titles of CEO and president. This acquisition appears to be the first for Little since he took the helm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I am not a smart man.</p>
<p>Earlier today I <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1395384930885115911">tweeted about $ASS</a>, a cryptocurrency named after a dog. In this case, Australian Shepherds. And after doing that obviously stupid thing, my Twitter feed became chock-full of ass-related imagery, memes, and $ASS coin stans breathing on me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very annoying as I run Tweetdeck on a work laptop which is now very, well, dicey a proposition given what I&#8217;m being sent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">save me <a href="https://t.co/CtmjcfeWdX">pic.twitter.com/CtmjcfeWdX</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>$ASS is short for Australian <em>Safe</em> Shepherd, by the by. It&#8217;s a cryptocurrency that, much like Dogecoin, is a joke.</p>
<p>A joke that its own website doesn&#8217;t take too seriously. For example, if you <a href="https://assfinance.com/">navigate to AssFinance</a>, you will find a very detailed look at $ASS&#8217;s technical underpinnings, and plans for the future:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2155412 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png 1013w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.52.41-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I found this hilarious. So I tweeted about it. And then everyone in the $ASS world began to assault my Twitter. Pro-tip: This is not a good way to get taken seriously. But as $ASS is not trying to be taken seriously, does that even matter?</p>
<p>The coin is effectively a limid pump, a cryptocurrency designed to get early adopters to spread the word about it, and then hold. It built its economics around just those goals:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2155427 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="99" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?resize=150,22 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?resize=300,44 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?resize=768,112 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?resize=680,99 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-20-at-10.55.39-AM.png?resize=50,7 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>But enough of all that. Why do we give a shit about $ASS? A few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This sort of financial stupidity is funny, but some regular folks are going to get burned.</li>
<li>The $ASS pump is indicative of the level of speculation present in the cryptocurrency world today, which is likely to the credibility detriment of more serious projects. And helps explain how bitcoin has managed the price appreciation it has in recent quarters.</li>
<li>$ASS coin is up 1794.3% in the last 14 days, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/australian-safe-shepherd">per CoinGecko</a>. This is likely key to its current charm; people love free money and past gains make for an attractive lie to oneself concerning future returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a concept, $ASS fits neatly into my budding view that as current generations of people in their 20s and 30s are desperate for a firmer foothold on a middle-class life than today&#8217;s wage-weak, healthcare-deficient, and labor-unfriendly economy is willing to provide, moon-shots on speculative bullshit have outsized appeal compared to other times in American history when it was easier to afford a house.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s hard to be serious about a <del>butt</del> dog-themed bit of Internet money, $ASS is, well, very 2021. And who are we to pretend to be better than covering a shitcoin? Even if only to mock it.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-05-20/crypto-market-prices-ass-coin-superdoge-billionaires-prosper-and-fall">has more on $ASS</a> if you want a more serious take about an unserious project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, true story. Over the weekend I was talking to someone about restaurant robotics. It’s a concept people often have trouble visualizing &#8212; and understandably so. Among other things, there’s really no commonly accepted form factor in a category that sometimes is literally a robot arm flipping hamburgers.</p>
<p>My short response was, “they’re large kiosks that make pizza.” And honestly, that’s not really far from the truth. These sorts of self-contained assembly line robots are probably about as close as we have to a consensus design in the category &#8212; and for good reason. They’re designed to operate with minimal interaction &#8212; largely the employee’s involvement is limited to order input, restocking ingredients and cleaning.</p>
<p>The pizza part is two-fold. First: people like pizza. It’s plentiful and popular, so it makes sense that it would be one of the first foodstuffs you’d want to automate. Second: it’s relatively easy to automate. The process for making it is consistent and the constraints are clear. It’s something that can be broken down into an easy to follow, step by step set of instructions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I covered two restaurant robots in the past week. It’s a category that saw a pretty sizable boost in interest during the pandemic, as restaurants were short-staffed essential services looking for ways to minimize human contact with food as the scientific world was scrambling to determine how the novel coronavirus is spread.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jalae0XrqG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pizza-robot-maker-picnic-raises-another-13-3m/">Pizza robot-maker Picnic raises another $16.3M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pizza robot-maker Picnic raises another $16.3M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pizza-robot-maker-picnic-raises-another-13-3m/embed/#?secret=jalae0XrqG" data-secret="jalae0XrqG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pizza-robot-maker-picnic-raises-another-13-3m/">Picnic</a> very much fits in with the aforementioned description. It is, quite literally, a big, pizza-making box. This week the Seattle-based company announced a $16.3 million raise that includes a $3 million bridge filed last fall. It’s targeting restaurants, as well as public gathering spaces (remember those?) like schools, stadiums and hospitals. There are a handful of companies in the category, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/xrobotics-is-keeping-the-dream-of-pizza-robots-alive/">XRobotics</a> &#8212; though the formerly best known, Zume,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/zume-looks-to-life-beyond-pizza/"> bailed out of the pizza robot space</a> a while back.</p>
<p>Chef Robotics announced a $7.7 million raise this week. I can’t really tell you what the final robot looks like yet, because that’s still trade secret stuff. Here’s what the company says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chef is designed to mimic the flexibility of humans, allowing customers to handle thousands of different kinds of food using minimal hardware changes. Chef does this using artificial intelligence that can learn how to handle more and more ingredients over time and that also improves. This allows customers to do things like change their menu often. Additionally, Chef’s modular architecture allows customers to quickly scale up just as they would by hiring more staff (but unlike humans, Chef always shows up on time and doesn’t need breaks).</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TAW7Nyax83"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/chef-robotics-raises-7-7m-to-help-automate-kitchens/">Chef Robotics raises $7.7M to help automate kitchens</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chef Robotics raises $7.7M to help automate kitchens&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/chef-robotics-raises-7-7m-to-help-automate-kitchens/embed/#?secret=TAW7Nyax83" data-secret="TAW7Nyax83" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not a lot to go off there, but the modularity bit is interesting &#8212; and something a lot of these companies are exploring. If you can get a robot to automate a simple, repetitive task, you can potentially offer swappable hardware that can apply the technology to different kinds of food.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pj1j9cioj_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Other notable raises for the week include <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ai-robotics-startup-mech-mind-completes-series-c-funding-led-by-tech-giant-meituan-301293375.html">Mech-Mind robots</a>. The Beijing-based company announced a Series C. It hasn’t revealed a specific figure, but given that it says the raise brings its total funding to over $100 million and it had previously raised a total of $79 million (including a $15 million Series B last year), you can extrapolate from there.</p>
<p>Mech-Mind is an industrial robotics and AI company focused on various manufacturing tasks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Each month in Robinhood's Q1 2021 produced more PFOF revenues than its entire year-ago quarter in aggregate.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An initial analysis of Robinhood&#8217;s Q1 2021 payment for order flow (PFOF) revenues sourced from company filings shows that the free-trading unicorn had a strong start to the year. Given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">raucous trading activity of the first quarter</a>, that news is not a surprise.</p>
<p>The aggregate revenue data helps explain how Robinhood was able to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raise as much capital as it did in the first quarter</a> despite running into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">issues with its technology</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">the United States government</a>; the company found itself at the center of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">the GameStop speculative rush</a>, which likely led to strong trading volumes, along with what The Exchange presumes was an unwelcome level of attention from regulators.</p>

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re sticking close to the company&#8217;s financial results using the lens of PFOF income, which the company said during a congressional hearing constitutes the majority of its revenues.</p>
<p>This particular revenue growth — or the lack thereof — is a good way to understand not only Robinhood&#8217;s own results but also its larger market. If Robinhood is seeing rapid growth and strong trading volumes, we can infer with some confidence that others in its space are enjoying a related, if not similar, level of interest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has explored storefronts for a while now. Here’s a pop-up in Manhattan’s SoHo district that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/made-by-google/"> we took a trip to some four+ years back</a>. But the company’s own branded retail experience has been fairly limited &#8212; unsurprising, given that it has always been a software company first.</p>
<p>This summer, however, the company is joining a growing number of tech companies that will their own retail stores. The first Google Store is opening in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, in the former Port Authority building that also houses the company’s NY offices.</p>
<p>The move follows in the footsteps of Apple and Samsung &#8212; both of whom have stores nearby (Amazon’s got its own book store, as well, but that’s further uptown near the Empire State Building).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like the competition, the shopping experience will center on Google hardware products first &#8212; that means things like Pixel phones and various Nest home devices. Google’s product offerings are still fairly limited compared to the likes of Apple and Samsung, though the recent closing of its Fitbit acquisition should go a ways toward offering a bit more variety in its brightly lit aisles.</p>
<p>This year is a particularly weird time to open your first retail store. Google’s had a fair amount of retail space in Chelsea for a while now, but COVID-19 almost certainly put a damper on any plans to launch last year. Though, NYC has been pretty quick to vaccinate its massive population, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-vaccines.html">41% of adults</a> fully vaccinated as of earlier this month.</p>

<p>Still, Google is prioritizing safety here. Per <a href="https://blog.google/products/devices-services/google-store-nyc/">a blog post:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Masks, hand sanitation and social distancing will be required in the Google Store, and we’ll clean all spaces multiple times a day. The number of guests inside will be limited to ensure our customers feel safe during their shopping experience, and easy pickup options will also be available. We will continue to closely follow the guidance of the local and national authorities to adapt our health and safety procedures as needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds to be part of a bigger hardware push for the company, which has struggled of late &#8212; particularly in the mobile category. Google calls the first store, “an important next step in our hardware journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">Twitter is relaunching its account verification system</a> to the public, the company previewed a slate of changes that will soon come to Twitter profiles. In addition to your name, photo, banner, bio and other features available today, the new Twitter profile will include an &#8220;About&#8221; tab that appears to the left of the tabs for Tweets, Tweets &amp; Replies, Media and Likes. This expansion will allow Twitter users to share more about themselves, including their pronouns, location, interests and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The profile hasn&#8217;t been meaningfully updated since 2014, which is a little mind blowing, considering how much both Twitter and the world have changed since then,&#8221; said Andrea Conway, the lead designer on Twitter&#8217;s Identity &amp; Profiles team. &#8220;Today, we don&#8217;t give people a ton of ways to express themselves and, in turn, we limit the number of signals available to understand the quality of that account, and help people determine who and what to trust on Twitter,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Additionally, from a design perspective, we&#8217;re dealing with a serious lack of space on the profile, and we really want to change that.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155025" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155025" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter wants the revamped profiles to not only expand the ways users can express themselves, it also envisions the profile as a new entry point to other areas of engagement on the platform in the future. That could be areas like Topics or Spaces, or something else. Though Twitter didn&#8217;t detail this point, it&#8217;s possible that as it rolls out the new Super Follow button for creators, it may make sense for those users to have more ways to share what they&#8217;re all about rather than relying on one of those &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, for instance.</p>
<p>Twitter also sees the potential for using the profile to increase user engagement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important to know not only who an account is, and the information they&#8217;ve shared proactively, but also what an account is into &#8212; because we think that if you&#8217;re interested in an account, you might also be interested in what they&#8217;re interested in. And this space has the potential to make that a whole lot easier,&#8221; Conway adds.</p>
<p>In addition to allowing users to share their pronouns in the new About tab, the redesigned profile will include other fields, sections and components.</p>
<p>Another notable new feature will be the ability to display whether your Twitter account is confirmed. That means you&#8217;ve verified your account with Twitter via email or phone. It&#8217;s a signal that could help to invite trust &#8212; or at least keep you from being trolled by being called a &#8220;bot,&#8221; a common Twitter insult that&#8217;s often levied during heated debates. And it&#8217;s a way to &#8220;verify&#8221; your account even if you don&#8217;t qualify for the coveted blue badge &#8212; a badge people often want because if conveys some sense of legitimacy.</p>
<p>Other fields currently found in your profile today may move into this About tab, like your location, birthday, join date or <a href="https://medium.com/twitter-features/translator-badge-380a236e08cb">translator badge</a>, Twitter says. And going forward, Twitter believes this tab will allow it to be more flexible when it comes to what information people what to share and how they share it.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer a time frame until the new profiles will launch, but said they would be &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coveted blue badge may soon be within your reach. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/relaunching-verification-and-whats-next.html">announced</a> today it will begin rolling out its new verification application system, which allows public figures and other accounts of high public interest to distinguish themselves with a checkmark that indicates they are who they say they are &#8212; like a government official, journalist, celeb, brand or business, or other notable name.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Twitter will begin to display the new verification application directly in the Account Setting tab to all users globally. From here, you can submit your application. You&#8217;ll then receive an emailed response in one to four weeks, depending on how many open applications are in the queue at the time.</p>
<p>Applications are processed by a newly expanded team at Twitter, not automated, which is why things may slow down at busy times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If approved, you&#8217;ll receive the profile badge automatically. And if denied, you can reapply 30 days after receiving Twitter&#8217;s decision. There&#8217;s no limit on how many times you can reapply, however.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155028" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155028" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Application-form-2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter; image of verification application screen</p></div></p>
<p>The return of verification will greatly expand access to the blue badge that only around 360,000 Twitter users hold today.</p>
<p>The system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/twitter-pauses-account-verifications-after-critics-slam-it-for-verifying-charlottesville-rally-organizer/">was officially paused in 2017</a> as the company grappled with consumer confusion over what it meant to be verified. While the checkmark was only meant to serve as an indicator that someone&#8217;s account was authentic, many viewed badgeholders as having some sort of elevated status on Twitter&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>This issue came to a head when it was discovered Twitter had <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-verifies-charlottesville-rally-boss-jason-kessler-who-called-slain-protesters-death-payback-time">verified</a> the account belonging to Jason Keller, the person who organized the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, even as genuinely noteworthy individuals were struggling to get their own accounts verified.</p>
<p>Although Twitter quietly continued to verify candidates running for public office, public officials, journalists and others in the years since, there was no longer an &#8220;official&#8221; means of requesting verification.</p>
<p>In late 2020, Twitter finally <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html">announced</a> it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/twitter-to-relaunch-account-verifications-in-early-2021-asks-for-feedback-on-policy/">relaunch account verifications</a> in early 2021 and debuted a draft of its policy for public feedback. Although Twitter is running a little behind schedule &#8212; it&#8217;s closer to mid-2021, after all &#8212; it is again reopening applications and publishing its new guidelines, which are largely unchanged from their initial publication.</p>
<p>Going forward, to qualify for verification, Twitter users must fit the criteria of one of the six following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government</li>
<li>Companies, brands and organizations</li>
<li>News organizations and journalists</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
<li>Sports and gaming</li>
<li>Activists, organizer and other influential individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories are just the start, Twitter says. It will later expand verification to include scientists, academics and religious leaders later this summer.</p>
<p>To become verified, an account must first establish its authenticity by providing a photo of an official government-issued ID, or by providing an official email address relevant to the category chosen, or an official website referencing the Twitter account.</p>

<p>Each of the specified categories then has its own sets of rules for what qualifies a person for verification.</p>
<p>While these are far too extensive to detail here (you can <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">read through the full policy</a> for that), there are a few rules worth highlighting. For example, journalists have to adhere to professional standards, like fact-checking, to qualify. Being listed in professional databases, like IMDb or Sportradar, can aid in verification for those in entertainment or gaming. And being mentioned by verified press in news articles can help brands and many individuals qualify.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"> full rules</a> are fairly detailed, and particularly when it comes to the catch-all category of &#8220;other influential individuals.&#8221; Here, Twitter has come up with a system that requires a combination of criteria related to both Twitter activity and off-site notability to be deemed noteworthy.</p>
<p>For example, a stable Wikipedia article, profile on Google Trends, news mentions or being listed among the leadership on an official website with &#8220;known advocacy work,&#8221; can help influential individuals qualify, along with at least one indication of being influential on Twitter itself. This includes meeting a bar for follower count or on-site activity, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">as defined by Twitter&#8217;s criteria</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter says it will hold verified accounts accountable for their tweets. In addition to having to follow the Twitter Rules like everyone else (even Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">couldn&#8217;t avoid penalty</a>, you probably recall), verified accounts that violate rules will be stripped of their badge. This penalty may be determined on a case-by-case basis, Twitter says. An egregious violation could see the badge immediately removed, but other violations may not see the same measure taken.</p>
<p>Verified accounts also have to have a &#8220;complete&#8221; profile, meaning profile name, profile image and either a confirmed email or confirmed phone number. The account must be active in the last six months, as well, and can&#8217;t have a Twitter Rule violation in the last 12 months that resulted in a seven-day or 12-hour lockout.</p>

<p>This focus on violations as blockers to verification is meant to keep unworthy individuals from getting badged &#8212; which was an issue in the past &#8212; but it still relies on Twitter&#8217;s Trust &amp; Safety team to do their job. And that&#8217;s been an area of concern for Twitter, where there are verified users who <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7w3zw/silicon-valley-elite-discuss-journalists-having-too-much-power-in-private-app">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/a-journalist-does-not-deserved-to-be-harassed-by-vcs-taylor-lorenz-balaji-srinivasan">harass</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/03/harassment-of-female-journalists-is-putting-news-outlets-to-the-test">others</a>, including verified <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/online-harassment-female-journalists/2021/03/13/ed24b0aa-82aa-11eb-ac37-4383f7709abe_story.html">female</a> <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/female-journalists-harassed-twitter.php">journalists</a>. For verification to work and be trusted, online Twitter Rule-breakers will need to feel the penalty of being un-badged.</p>
<p>Twitter says verification is only one way it&#8217;s changing how profiles on its platform will work.</p>
<p>In the future, Twitter will introduce new ways to designate other types of accounts, including &#8220;helpful&#8221; bots &#8212; the automated accounts that provide information that&#8217;s useful, like COVID-19 updates or earthquake warnings, for example; or those that use Twitter in a creative way.</p>
<p>Later, Twitter will tackle handling memorialized accounts. But these changes will be about adding designations, not verification.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155026" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155026" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155026" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Automated-Account-Profile.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter; image of an automated account profile</p></div></p>
<p>Demand for verification has been growing over the years, particularly as the creator economy has taken shape, where high-profile individuals translate their online fame to real-world success and cash. Creators may not meet Twitter&#8217;s criteria for verification, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">they&#8217;ll soon be able to add &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; buttons</a> to their profile that will allow subscribers to pay for special access, like exclusive content or newsletters. Meanwhile, Twitter itself is reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets">working on a paid subscription program</a>, Twitter Blue, but this is about gaining access to advanced features, like Undo Tweets and bookmark collections, not about paid access to verification.</p>
<p>To combat the need for everyone to feel important and trusted on Twitter, the company will also be revamping Twitter profiles. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/">More on that here</a>).</p>
<p>In short, the new profiles will be able to display more information about who they are, including support for pronouns, what they&#8217;re interested in, and whether they&#8217;re a &#8220;confirmed&#8221; user &#8212; meaning, they&#8217;ve verified themselves via an email or phone number.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155025" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155025" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/About.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Twitter says it will continue to update and audit it policies around these areas as it moves forward with public applications for verification and the other new features.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to Twitter to read about what&#8217;s happening with current events, the global pandemic elections, and other government conversations happening across a variety of topics and interests,&#8221; said B Byrne, Twitter&#8217;s product lead focused on identity, speaking to reporters about the changes. &#8220;The blue verified badge gives people on Twitter more context about who they&#8217;re interacting with. They can determine if the content is trustworthy and make their own decisions regarding the sources they choose to follow, which we believe leads to healthier, more informed conversations,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Firefly Aerospace may be developing rockets of its own, but it&#8217;s also simultaneously building Blue Ghost, its first lunar lander. Blue Ghost will hop a ride with a rocket from a different launch company — SpaceX — in 2023, the companies announced today.</p>
<p>While Firefly Aerospace is in the process of developing its own launch vehicles, the company is still looking forward to its first orbital flight of its Alpha rocket, which is not a rocket capable of taking large payloads to the moon. SpaceX, meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t yet sent a Falcon 9 on a lunar mission, but it has flown a lot of successful missions, and its specs allow for moon deliveries, with many other commercial lunar lander developers selecting the vehicle as their launch vehicle of choice.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NASA issues new call for lunar payload deliveries from its commercial moon lander partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/nasa-issues-new-call-for-lunar-payload-deliveries-from-its-commercial-moon-lander-partners/embed/#?secret=LRLWLUdpWW" data-secret="LRLWLUdpWW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Firefly&#8217;s Blue Ghost aims to fly in just a couple years&#8217; time, and it&#8217;s tasked with carrying 10 payloads on behalf of NASA as part of their Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. NASA is using that program to award private companies missions to carry experiments to the moon&#8217;s surface, in part as preparation for the forthcoming Artemis human moon exploration (and, eventually, long-term habitation) missions.</p>
<p>SpaceX got the nod in part because the Falcon 9&#8217;s performance specs mean the Blue Ghost can conserve more of its own fuel, making it possible for the lander to take on around 150 kg (330 lbs) of cargo. Firefly, like many other CLPS providers, also intends to take up payloads alongside the NASA experiments from other commercial entities, selling off that space to make more revenue.</p>
<p>The first lander launching under CLPS is scheduled to fly sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, and a total of six are currently awarded and planned for tentative launches through 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is further expanding into audiobooks &#8212; but not in the way you may think. The company today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-20/storytel-audiobooks-will-be-available-on-spotify-later-this-year/">announced</a> a new partnership with audiobooks platform <a href="https://www.storytel.com/">Storytel</a>, which will allow existing Storytel subscribers to connect their account through Spotify to access their audiobooks within Spotify&#8217;s app. The partnership is the first notable example of what&#8217;s possible with Spotify&#8217;s recently <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/">introduced</a> Open Access Platform (OAP), which aims to give creators and publishers a way to extend their reach.</p>
<p>The company briefly spoke about its plans for Open Access Platform during its press event, Stream On, earlier this year, where it also detailed plans for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify HiFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">other new features</a>. The Open Access Platform gives a publisher or creator a new way to deliver their content to their existing subscriber base by allowing their customers to stream the content through Spotify. Storytel is the first major publisher to adopt OAP, thought Ben Thompson of Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/spotifys-surprise/">did say</a> that he&#8217;s also using the platform.</p>
<p>The technology supports using the creator or publisher&#8217;s existing login system and allows them to maintain direct control over their relationship with listeners. For example, a paid podcast could use the system to stream to existing subscribers. In Storytel&#8217;s case, however, the company offers audiobook content, not podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want everyone to have access to great stories, and today Storytel offers more than 500,000 audiobooks on a global basis across 25 markets,&#8221; said Jonas Tellander, Storytel founder and CEO, in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://investors.storytel.com/en/storytel-partnering-with-spotify-making-audiobooks-even-more-accessible-for-storytel-customers/">announcement</a>. &#8220;Partnering with Spotify make amazing audiobook experiences and exciting authorships easier than ever to access for our customers, while we will also be tapping into the opportunity of reaching new audiences who are on Spotify today, but have not yet experienced the magic of audiobooks,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A competitor to Audible, Storytel offers audiobooks in a variety of languages, including some in English, for a fixed monthly price (around $20/mo, but varies by market). Its unlimited library access may make it a better deal for people who listen to more than one audiobook per month. Typically, Storytel customers would stream via the mobile app for iOS or Android.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify launches paid podcasts through new Anchor feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/embed/#?secret=2jpfLNLI9G" data-secret="2jpfLNLI9G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has 1.6 million subscribers, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/storytel-signs-audiobooks-partnership-with-spotify-2021-05-20">a Reuters report. </a>Spotify, meanwhile, has 356 million users, including 158 million subscribers across 178 markets.</p>
<p>The integration itself will go live later in 2021, allowing Storytel customers to sign into their accounts then stream through Spotify by linking their accounts. Spotify doesn&#8217;t have plans to market to users to sign up for a Storytel subscription from its app at this time, but at the point of account linking, users could be directed to sign up instead of log in, if need be.</p>
<p>Spotify had dabbled in audiobooks before Storytel. In January this year, for example, it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-tests-audiobooks-with-frankenstein-jane-eyre-and-other-literary-classics-exclusive-4121062/">began testing the format</a> with a handful of classics, like &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8221; &#8220;Jane Eyre,&#8221; &#8220;Persuasion&#8221; and others, narrated by celebs. It had also previously offered the first &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; book with chapters narrated by stars like Daniel Radcliffe, David Beckham and Dakota Fanning.</p>
<p>More partners for the Open Access Platform will be introduced this summer, Spotify says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Local news has been battered over the past two decades. The rise of the internet shredded some of the long-held monopolies of newspapers and local TV stations on news and classified ads, while social networks like Facebook, Nextdoor and Citizen have increasingly pulled in reader attention for neighborhood updates. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/local-news-disappear-pen-america.html">Newspapers have closed</a>, journalists have been decimated and there are increasing numbers of “<a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2018/about-1300-u-s-communities-have-totally-lost-news-coverage-unc-news-desert-study-finds/">news deserts</a>” with no coverage whatsoever.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">there is a creator revolution underway right now</a> in online media. Audience development, community and subscription are coming together in fresh ways that seem particularly opportune for local journalism today. Will these new sets of tools finally allow for the rebuilding of local journalism after the last era of hollowing out?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.omgmedia.com">Overstory Media Group</a> (which goes by the expressive OMG) believes precisely that the software tools and business models have been honed to dramatically change the equation for local news. Co-founded and led by Farhan Mohamed, who was formerly editor-in-chief of Vancouver-focused news site Daily Hive, the company operates 10 local news brands and has hired 30 full-time employees as it creates a sustainable and dare I say profitable approach to local media.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I had my own email newsletter when I was a kid,” Mohamed recounts. I “saw a gap: no one is telling me what is happening around me.” To get a sense of the bootstrapped nature of the operation, he sent the newsletter through Hotmail, and he eventually migrated into the modern world of local journalism. What he found was distressing. The “user experience is terrible, stories are terrible… I don’t know how normal people do this,” he said.</p>
<p>He saw an opportunity in starting over with the basics of what local news means for its own community. “I come from a background of community building, rather than just the news and journalism,” he said. He felt that there was a model of using modern internet technologies to allow readers to be stakeholders in these news operations.</p>
<p>He ultimately linked up with Andrew Wilkinson, who runs <a href="https://www.tinycapital.com">Tiny Capital</a>, a fund that buys tiny internet businesses and scales them up while allowing their original founders to exit. He had created a newsletter-driven publication called <a href="https://www.capitaldaily.ca">Capital Daily</a> to cover the developments in Victoria, British Columbia. Very quickly, the publication started getting tens of thousands of subscribers, all for a region with just a few hundred thousand people in it.</p>
<p>Mohamed and Wilkinson came together to found OMG and start to scale the Capital Daily model to more publications. They built out a tech stack centered on <a href="https://trypico.com">Pico</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/">just closed a new $6.5 million seed round last month</a>, and also designed growth and brand playbooks for switching on new brands.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dWjtL6fnL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/">Creator monetization and CRM startup Pico raises $6.5M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Creator monetization and CRM startup Pico raises $6.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/pico-2-0/embed/#?secret=3dWjtL6fnL" data-secret="3dWjtL6fnL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The goal with each new brand is to get to breakeven as quickly as possible. “We have our models and projections on how long it takes to get a brand sustainable, and with each brand, we are refining that model,” Mohamed said. “Maybe it’s not 12 months to sustainability, but 10 months or even nine months.” His goal is ambitious: He wants to get to 50 brands and 250 journalists by 2023, and “I also think we could get to 100 brands.”</p>
<p>While the company has what I would dub playbooks, it understands that not every brand is going to be identical. It has a basic structure for how each brand should be built and what cadence new stories need to be delivered, but it is also flexible in responding to the unique needs of each new audience it brings to the table.</p>
<p>For journalists, the company’s pitch is centered on stability and focus on growth. “You have editorial control, you just do what you need to,” he said. “We can help you… we know what is going to work” when it comes to building out community and growth marketing. Perhaps most valuable for journalists is the community of other reporters who are walking the same path and are confronting similar challenges as they expand their communities and subscriber bases.</p>
<p>While the company has been exclusively focused on Canadian brands so far, covering cities as diverse as Vancouver, Victoria, Fraser and Calgary, it also sees opportunities to export its model outside the great white north. “We’ve had conversations with people in the States, in Southeast Asia, in Europe,” Mohamed says.</p>
<p>Obviously at this point, a certain cynicism can enter into any analysis of local news, what with decades of misfires and overly optimistic dreams of success amidst the rubble of legacy publishing empires. But OMG has a bit of that pop that says, this time, it might just be different.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toast has a reported valuation over $5 billion and has raised more than $900 million since launch. The restaurant POS service has clearly been on a rapid growth trajectory, but how has the company navigated the market during the pandemic, which has pushed and pulled the restaurant industry unlike ever before?</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-bessemer-and-toast">Extra Crunch Live (May 26 at 3pm ET</a>), we&#8217;ll find out. We&#8217;re sitting down with president and co-founder of Toast, Aman Narang, and one of the company&#8217;s investors, Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; Kent Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett is a partner out of the Cambridge office, focusing on consumer products and services as well as consumer-facing software. Before venture, Bennett was a creative executive for an entertainment production company called Licht Entertainment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His portfolio includes Bevi, Blue Apron, Xtime and, of course, Toast.</p>
<p>Narang spent seven years at Oracle, then Endeca, working on the development of the company&#8217;s business intelligence platform and mobile commerce platform.</p>
<p>He co-founded Toast in 2011 and has been growing the company ever since, adding new products and features to the restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Narang and Bennett to learn about how they came together for the company&#8217;s Series B deal, which Bessemer led. We&#8217;ll also talk about why Bennett wanted to bet on Toast, how they&#8217;ve worked together since and how they overcome challenges and disagreements. If we&#8217;re lucky, we may even get a peek at Toast&#8217;s original Series B pitch deck.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I think it’s important that we explicitly discuss something that every VC instinctively knows: The hype around a given business or category has become a form of bias for investors and founders when vetting ideas to pursue. At any point in time, you can find FOMO-flavored bad business decisions based on false market signals somewhere in tech. It’s human nature for excitement to be contagious, but treating it as a leading factor when considering a new opportunity is not a good idea.</p>

	</p>
<p>Take the 17th century tulip-mania, when, at one point, Dutch speculators drove tulip futures so high that one bulb of a particularly rare species was valued at more than a fully furnished luxury house<sup>1</sup>. We can look at this and collectively lampoon <em>anyone</em> who could possibly have bought into that absurd trend.</p>
<p>But that’s the rule with mega-hyped markets. The dot-com apocalypse was inevitable in hindsight. So was the consumer lending bubble that set off the global financial crisis. But major market catastrophes aside, newly hyped sectors in tech seem to pop up, like Moore’s Law clockwork, every year or so.</p>
<p>In the last 15 years, giant bonfires of cash have turned to ash financing companies in hyped up sectors like SoLoMo (I bet many people reading this have never even heard of this trend), clean tech, VR gaming, daily deals, crypto (which spawned flashy undercard entries like <a href="https://www.potcoin.com/">PotCoin</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16219468/burger-king-russia-cryptocurrency-whoppercoin-blockchain-trading-waves">BurgerKing’s WhopperCoin</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.trumpcoin.com/">TrumpCoin</a>), the sharing economy, scooters (in which Bird, Lime, Lyft and Uber competed around little more than the color scheme of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-12-05/almost-every-electric-scooter-comes-from-this-chinese-company">otherwise identical Segway Ninebots</a>), and SPACs (through which the aforementioned white-colored <a href="https://www.axios.com/bird-scooters-spac-379ba912-0195-47c4-a2b1-a3e063e333bd.html">scooter company</a> is going public).</p>
<p>Usually, these bubbles start when a breakout company creates a discontinuity in the market — a technology that changes how we live (Apple’s iPhone), or delivers an exceptional solution to a ubiquitous pain point better and more cost effectively than before (Uber’s ride-sharing). Rational speculators look to apply lessons from these breakouts to identify other massive winners. If a few seem to take off, irrational FOMO takes over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://workrise.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workrise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built a workforce management platform for the skilled trades, announced today that it has raised $300 million in a Series E round led by U.K.-based Baillie Gifford that values the company at $2.9 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investor Franklin Templeton joined existing backers &#8212; including Founders Fund, Bedrock Capital, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Moore Strategic Ventures, 137 Ventures and Brookfield Growth Partners &#8212; in putting money in the round. With this latest financing, Workrise has now raised more than $750 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may know Austin-based Workrise better by its former name, RigUp. The company </span><a href="https://www.workrise.com/hub/introducing-workrise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changed its name earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect a new emphasis on industries other than just oil and gas after the industry took a beating in recent years.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2020, Workrise laid off one-quarter of its corporate employees as the industry took an even bigger hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. It currently has more than 600 employees in 25 offices.</p>
<p>Despite the rocky start to the year, Workrise apparently ended up rebounding. Its gross revenue has tripled since 2018, going from just under $300 million to about $900 million to close out 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workrise was founded in 2014 as a marketplace for on-demand services and skilled labor in the energy industry. In October 2019, it raised a $300 million Series D round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ndreessen Horowitz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a16z) that valued the company at $1.9 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Workrise has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broadened its reach to include wind, solar, commercial construction and defense industries. In a nutshell, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">connects skilled laborers with infrastructure and energy companies looking to staff and manage projects efficiently. Workrise&#8217;s online platform matches workers with over 500 companies in its network, manages payroll and benefits and provides access to training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The shift to clean energy and a redoubling of investment in infrastructure are opening up jobs that are desperately in need of filling,” said Workrise co-founder and CEO (and former energy investor) Xuan Yong in a statement. “Our platform makes it easier for skilled workers to find work and for companies to hire in-demand workers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Bujnowski, investment manager at Baillie Gifford, points out that Workrise’s online management platform is “disrupting a sector that’s so far been slow to adopt new technologies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workrise now serves more than 70 metro areas in the U.S., including Atlanta, where the company is matching trade workers with commercial construction companies, and in Broomfield, Colordao, where the company trains and matches workers to jobs across the U.S. wind industry. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also offers trade workers access to training that equips them for energy and infrastructure jobs that are on the rise. Last year, Workrise placed more than 4,500 workers, or nearly a third of all its workers placed in 2020, in renewable-energy jobs. </span></p>
<p>Specifically, the company says in total, it placed 8,000 unique workers in jobs in 2019, with 13% in renewables. That number jumped to 15,000 in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trees, those deciduous entities you can occasionally see outdoors when not locked down or strapped down at a desktop ruminating on a video call, have long been the inspiration for fresh new ideas. Stories abound of how founders built companies while walking the foothills in Silicon Valley or around parks in San Francisco, and yet, we’ve managed over the past year to take movement mostly out of our remote work lives.</p>
<p>Chicago-based <a href="https://www.meetwithspot.com">Spot Meetings</a> wants to reinvigorate our meetings — and displace Zoom as the default meeting medium at the same time.</p>
<p>The product and company are just a few months old and remain in closed beta (albeit opening up a bit shortly here), and today the company is announcing $5 million in seed funding led by Ilya Fushman at Kleiner Perkins. That follows a <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/inno/stories/profiles/2021/03/17/spot-audio-walking-meetings.html">$1.9 million pre-seed round led by Chapter One</a> earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and co-founder Greg Caplan said that the team is looking to rebuild the meeting from the ground up for an audio-only environment. “On mobile, it needs to be abundantly simple to be very functional and understood for users so that they can actually use it on the go,” he described. In practice, that requires product development across a wide range of layers.</p>
<p>The product’s most notable feature today is that it has an assistant, aptly named Spot, which listens in on the call and which participants can direct commands to while speaking. For instance, saying “Spot Fetch” will pull the last 40 seconds of conversation, transcribe it, create a note in the meeting and save it for follow-up. That prevents the multi-hand tapping required to save a note or to-do list for follow-up with our current meeting products. You “don’t even need to take your phone out,” Caplan points out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="87o1pcIa0n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/is-zoom-the-next-android-or-the-next-blackberry/">Is Zoom the next Android or the next BlackBerry?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is Zoom the next Android or the next BlackBerry?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/is-zoom-the-next-android-or-the-next-blackberry/embed/#?secret=87o1pcIa0n" data-secret="87o1pcIa0n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What gets more interesting is the collaboration layer the company has built into the product. Every audio meeting has a text-based scratch pad shared with all participants, allowing users to copy and paste snippets into the meeting as needed. Those notes and any information that Spot pulls in are saved into workspaces that can be referenced later. Spot also sends out emails to participants with follow-ups from these notes. If the same participants join another audio meeting later, Spot will pull in the notes from their last meeting so there is a running timeline of what’s been happening.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155355" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155355" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2155355" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?w=615" alt="" width="615" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg 2133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=136,150 136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=271,300 271w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=768,849 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=615,680 615w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=1389,1536 1389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=1853,2048 1853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/spot-in-progress.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155355" class="wp-caption-text">Spot&#8217;s product design emphasizes collaboration within an audio-focused experience. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spot Meetings</p></div></p>
<p>Obviously, transcription features are built-in, but Spot sees opportunities in offering edited transcripts of long calls where only a few minutes of snippets might be worth specifically following up on. So the product is a bit more deliberate in encouraging users to select the parts of a conversation that are relevant for their needs, rather than delivering a whole bolus of text that no one is ever actually going to read.</p>
<p>“Collaboration from now and the future is going to be primarily digital … in-person is forever going to be the exception and not the rule,” Caplan explained. Longer term, the company wants to add additional voice commands to the product and continue building an audio-first (and really, an audio-only) environment. Audio “very uniquely helps people focus on the conversation at hand,” he said, noting that video fatigue is a very real phenomenon today for workers. To that end, more audio features like smarter muting are coming. When a participant isn’t talking, their background noise will automatically melt away.</p>

<p>Before Spot Meetings, Caplan was the CEO and co-founder of Remote Year, a startup that was designing a service for company employees to take working trips overseas. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/18/oh-the-places-you-will-go-with-hackers/">I first covered it back in 2015</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/remote-year-series-a/">it went on to raise some serious venture dollars</a> before the pandemic hit last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/remote-year-which-helps-you-work-while-traveling-the-world-lays-off-50-of-staff/">the company laid off 50% of its workforce</a>. Caplan left as CEO in April last year, and <a href="https://skift.com/2020/10/05/selina-nabs-remote-year-in-bet-on-subscription-travel-for-digital-nomads/">the company was ultimately sold to Selina</a>, which offers co-working spaces to travelers, in October.</p>
<p>Caplan’s co-founder who leads product and engineering at Spot Meetings is Hans Petter “HP” Eikemo. The duo met during the very first Remote Year cohort. “He has been a software engineer for two decades [and was] literally the first person I called,” Caplan said. The team will grow further with the new funding, and the company hopes to start opening its beta to its 6,000 waitlist users over the next 3-4 weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company and Seoul, South Korea-based SK Innovation signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture to domestically manufacture batteries for electric vehicles, the two companies said Thursday. The new venture, dubbed BlueOvalSK, will produce around 60 GWh annually starting mid-decade. The MOU is the latest sign that Ford intends to vertically develop its battery capabilities.</p>
<p>“Initially with just a Mustang Mach-E, we felt like it was most efficient for us to purchase the batteries from the supply base, but as we start to move up that adoption curve, and move from just the early adopters to the early majority [. . .] we now have sufficient volume to justify this level of investment and this is why we&#8217;re pursuing this partnership,” Ford’s chief product platform and operations officer Hau Thai-Tang said Thursday.</p>
<p>Ownership structures will be worked out in the future, Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer, told reporters Thursday. The 60 GWh production capacity would likely span two manufacturing sites but the companies are still determining those plans, including locations of the plants across North America, Drake added. Sixty GWh roughly translates to enough battery capacity to build 600,000 vehicles, Thai-Tang said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford has taken strides in recent months to build a vertically integrated capability to manufacture battery cells at scale. In April the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/">it would open</a> a battery technology development center in Michigan. It also led, with BMW, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">$130 million investment</a> into solid-state battery developer Solid Power’s Series B round.</p>

<p>But Ford has not always been so bullish on making batteries in-house. “Our product plans changed dramatically,” Thai-Tang said.</p>
<p>The news comes less than 24 hours after Ford debuted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lighting</a>, the electric version of its iconic nameplate vehicle and the best-selling truck in America. The Lighting is one of three EVs that Ford has debuted in the past year and will be a cornerstone of the company’s plans to invest $22 billion in EVs through 2025.</p>
<p>SK Innovation already has two separate EV battery plants under construction in Georgia under a collective investment of $2.6 billion. One of the plants is already producing batteries and the other is set to become operational in 2023. The company is also building a separate factory in Tennessee, with Volkswagen AG as its customer. Ford and SK Innovation’s relationship spans many years, with the automaker selecting SK as its battery supplier for the Lightning in 2018.</p>
<p>The company recently completed a $1.8 billion settlement in April over trade secret disputes with rival LG Energy Solutions. The resolution came after a two-year dispute that nearly led to SK Innovation shutting down its Georgia plans.</p>
<p>The two Korean conglomerates have invested billions in American battery manufacturing alongside their automaker partners. LG Energy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/gm-lg-chem-studying-the-feasibility-of-a-second-battery-cell-plant-in-the-u-s/">building manufacturing facilities</a> in Ohio and Tennessee under its joint venture with General Motors, Ultium Cells LLC.</p>
<p>“The scale just makes sense now,” Drake said. “It&#8217;s the perfect time to start to do this.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PowerPoint may still dominate the landscape for presentations in many people&#8217;s minds, but some might say that legacy status also makes Microsoft&#8217;s software ripe for disruption. Now, a startup out of Berlin called <a href="https://pitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitch</a> has just picked up a substantial Series B of $85 million to take it on with what it believes is a more dynamic approach.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Lakestar and Tiger Global, with previous backers Index Ventures and Thrive Capital also participating. We understand from sources close to the company that the valuation is now at $600 million for the Berlin-based startup.</p>
<p>In the words of CEO and co-founder Christian Reber, the ambition is to create the &#8220;YouTube for presentations,&#8221; with the ability for people to create, collaborate on and share presentations with each other through an online-based interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His interest, meanwhile, in taking on Microsoft has a deeper story to it. As we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered before</a>, Reber&#8217;s previous startup, the planning startup Wunderlist, was acquired by Microsoft and folded into its productivity suite, only to eventually be killed off, much to Reber&#8217;s disbelief and disappointment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WtNQDNp6jJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/">Pitch, a presentation startup from Wunderlist&#8217;s founders, raises $30M more to take on PowerPoint</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pitch, a presentation startup from Wunderlist&#8217;s founders, raises $30M more to take on PowerPoint&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/embed/#?secret=WtNQDNp6jJ" data-secret="WtNQDNp6jJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not to dwell too much in the past, the funding Pitch has now raised will be used in several areas, including hiring more people and reach. The startup has already seen good progress on the latter front. Pitch is already being used by tens of thousands of teams, it says, who have created some 125,000 workspaces on the platform. Customers include (ironically) a number of other trailblazers in the world of business productivity: Intercom, Superhuman and Notion are among the list.</p>
<p>The plan will be to work on bringing on more users into its freemium universe, while converting more to its Pitch Pro $10/user/month paid tier, which includes more extensions like unlimited storage, video uploads, version history and advanced permissioning. Pro already has a &#8220;couple of thousand&#8221; subscribers, Reber said, enough to prove out that &#8220;we definitely see our business model working.&#8221; Pitch is also working on rolling out an enterprise version so that it can sell Pitch into the bigger businesses and deployments that dominate usage of PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And the other way that Pitch plans to bring more people into the fold will be with more functionality. Along with the funding, Pitch is rolling out some new features that will include the beginnings of an ecosystem, where presentation designers and creators will be able to upload presentation templates, as well as presentations themselves, to help other people get started in creating their own presentations.</p>
<p>The idea here is to celebrate creators, Reber said, but it&#8217;s (at least for now) stopping short of paying them, seeing this more as a way of sharing designs and ideas in a more collaborative exchange with each other. Both, however, seem to me to be ripe opportunities down the line for building a marketplace. Creating a great pitch deck for a startup is great to share as a resource, but if you are also, say, a leadership coach who makes a living out of giving people inspiring direction on how to handle something, a pitch deck with that IP in it perhaps might not be something you&#8217;d always be willing to part with for free. (Reber says his inspiration here was the world of design forums like Dribble, where an exchange of ideas has thrived.)</p>
<p>Initially, the user-generated content will be selected by Pitch itself, although the plan over time will be to make it something that will be open to everyone, Reber said.</p>
<p>Another new feature will be presentation analytics. This will not be unlike the kind of data that people currently can apply to, say, email or web traffic to measure what people are clicking on, how long they are spending looking at content and where they are dropping off. Pitch will apply the same to its presentations &#8212; which are HTML-coded &#8212; so that those who are making them and sending them around can get a better idea of how they are performing, and even begin the process of A-B testing to try out different approaches.</p>
<p>Reber points out that analytics will be opt-in only: If users choose not to share that tracking, it won&#8217;t be shared, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a German business, we have a special relationship with data privacy in the greatest sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We care deeply about making sure we approach features in a privacy-first way.&#8221; The idea is to make it less like spyware, and more like the kind of analytics one might have on YouTube for videos there.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s adding in more video features to bring in narrative recording and playback. These first will be &#8220;recorded&#8221; around the presentations themselves, but longer term, it&#8217;s likely that the feature will also have a live element, which makes a lot of sense since a lot of presentations have had their most highly trafficked exposure by way of webinars or live presentations (say, around an earnings call), where you might not only have multiple presenters talking along a slide deck, but also people feeding back, asking questions in relation to the presentation and so on.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a little WordPress-like, that&#8217;s not a coincidence. Reber noted that website building is something else that Pitch wants to bring into the platform. &#8220;We are experimenting with that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In my opinion, presentations are collections of information and we want to publish them in various ways. Slides just happens to be one format. But if it&#8217;s all already written in HTML, why not build it also into a site? That will be another feature coming, and something that we will be also using the funding for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, that may not work for deeper content efforts (such as publications like the one you are reading right now), but would be perfectly adequate for, say, basic sites along the kind that are built on sites like Squarespace to lay out some online real estate for a small business. The scope of what you can already do, and what Pitch wants you to do, is precisely what makes this all so interesting to investors, they say.</p>
<p>“The exciting vision that Christian and the team at Pitch have is beyond just being a superior alternative to legacy presentation software,&#8221; said Stephen Nundy, partner at Lakestar, in a statement. &#8220;A reimagining of the entire workflow surrounding presentations is very much overdue, and when coupled with the ability to harness new data and media integrations, Pitch will lead the way in changing how stories are told. I’m very proud to be joining the board of a European company with its sights set on a truly global opportunity.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly impressed by the quality of Pitch’s offering today and Christian’s vision for the future. Pitch will be a true productivity platform, and we are excited to become investors in this special company,” John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://maven.com/">Maven</a>, a startup that helps professionals teach cohort-based classes, has raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The round places A16z general partner Andrew Chen on Maven’s board &#8211; and is his latest lead check in a creator-focused company, similarly pouring millions into recent rounds for Clubhouse and Substack.</p>
<p>The investment comes seven months after Maven, then nameless, left stealth alongside a $4.3 million round led by First Round Capital, and three months after it raised a $750,000 <a href="https://republic.co/maven">equity crowdfunding round</a>. While the company declined to disclose valuation, we do know that it’s a lot of fast cash earmarked toward fueling the same bet: that the future of cohort-based learning is the future of education.</p>

<p>And if you’re wondering why, I’d tell you it&#8217;s two-fold. First, the startup has an impressive founding team: Udemy co-founder Gagan Biyani, altMBA co-founder Wes Kao, and early Venmo employee and Socratic co-founder Shreyans Bhansali.</p>
<p>Second, Maven has some impressive growth to tout, showing its potential. Maven’s core product right now is a suite of services that makes it easier to run a cohort-based course, while taking a 10% fee &#8211; similar to Substack &#8211; from a professional’s revenue. In three months after its January launch, four Maven courses earned over $100,000. To date, over $1 million worth of courses has been sold on Maven.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dear Startups: Don’t repaint, reinvent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/startups-dont-repaint-reinvent/embed/#?secret=GfUCXhxILk" data-secret="GfUCXhxILk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the new capital, Kao tells me that her team is focused on getting instructors to see the value of CBCs. The startup has had over 2,000 people apply to become instructors, and expects to grow from 7 to 100 instructors by end of the year. Some of Maven’s investors, including Sahil Lavingia and Li Jin, are instructors on its platform. Long-term, the startup sees its competitive differentiation as helping experts who aren’t “conventional instructors” start sharing their knowledge.</p>
<p>The co-founder teaches a course to all incoming Maven instructors &#8211; meta, I know &#8211; from deciding to put in a curriculum to understanding course-market fit and building buzz for the course.</p>
<p>While Kao explained that instructors like the idea of turning free advice in modular, revenue-generating classes, she said “monetizing that expertise is often really hard.”</p>
<p>“Traditional platforms—Instagram, TikTok, Twitter—create a division between activities intended to monetize and those meant for community building,” she said. “Meaning, creators give away valuable content, and then monetize via brand partnerships or low-margin merchandise—activities that often detract from community-building.”</p>
<p>The biggest challenge ahead, she thinks, is expanding the mindshare about CBCs for creators. It needs to show the importance of signal in the cacophony of air horns that want creator’s attention.</p>
<p>It’s a problem that Maven is all too familiar with it.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest things we had to untangle early on was the difference between “content” and the Maven offering,” Kao explained. “There’s no shortage of content in our world.” The startup had to spend a good chunk of time figuring out how to create a cohort-based class experience that pairs community and accountability with that content. And it still has ways to go.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it ended up being quite simple. In our view, we’ve reached the Post Content Age,” she said. “In other words: Content is no longer scarce in education. It’s either free or low cost, and it’s abundant.”</p>
