					<description><![CDATA[Selling an asset at a loss is a bad idea in most areas of business, but it is a particularly bad idea in a market where sales cycles are slow, unpredictable and largely out of your control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After 3.5 years, Zillow announced this week that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/business/zillow-q3-earnings-home-flipping-ibuying.html">shutting down Zillow Offers</a> and exiting the iBuying business. The news was not entirely unexpected, as the company had previously admitted to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-says-it-cant-buy-any-more-homes-this-year-11634574144?mod=article_inline">pausing home buying</a> through the end of the year and was reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt">seeking investors to purchase 7,000 homes</a> it had in its inventory.</p>
<p>Still, the retreat shocked the market: Zillow’s stock fell more than 20% on the news and fears around the iBuying market drove shares of competitors Opendoor down by about 15% and Offerpad about 6%. Those stocks have recovered a bit since, but there still seems to be some trepidation around iBuying as a business model.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Zillow basically confessed that its pricing model is at best a lagging indicator and really no good in a market that isn’t aggressively moving up and to the right.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We’ll know more about the impact of slowing housing sales and price appreciation on the broader market when <a href="https://investor.opendoor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opendoor-report-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-november-10">Opendoor</a> and <a href="https://investor.offerpad.com/news-releases/news-details/2021/Offerpad-to-Report-Third-Quarter-2021-Results-on-November-10th/default.aspx">Offerpad</a> announce their third-quarter earnings next week. In the meantime, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Zillow’s big loss wasn’t necessarily a business model problem with iBuying as a whole as much as it was a problem with Zillow’s algorithm.</p>
<p>At their most basic level, iBuyers seek to purchase homes at a slight discount to their market value, offering the convenience of a cash offer to sellers in exchange. They then make any necessary repairs or renovations necessary, list the property and attempt to sell it for more than their initial purchase price, making money on the spread.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem Zillow ran into, and the reason it decided to exit the business, was that in the third quarter the company was <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/inside-zillows-misadventures-in-ibuying/">paying above market value</a> for homes and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-offers-pause-ibuyers-homes-atlanta-phoenix-dallas-houston-minneapolis-2021-10">selling them for less</a> than their initial market price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a> announced a major deal today with <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CME Group</a> to move CME&#8217;s futures and options markets to the cloud over a 10-year period. The deal has several components, including a $1 billion investment from Google into CME. Google would not say how much the total deal is worth, however.</p>
<p>Philip Moyer, VP of strategic industries at Google Cloud, says this isn&#8217;t your standard deal where Google simply helps the customer move workloads to the cloud. &#8220;Instead, this is really a demonstration by Google and CME, that we&#8217;re really committed to the long-term journey necessary to take the hardest elements of the financial services industry to the cloud,&#8221; Moyer told me.</p>
<p>He says that what makes the deal so complex is that a company like CME has among the most demanding security, latency and redundancy and recovery requirements. The companies are not saying how the deal is structured in terms of costs, but the plan is to implement it across several phases, starting with the easiest workloads with the lowest latency requirements, followed by data analysis tooling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229656" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the second phase we&#8217;re really focused on trying to innovate by doing more real-time data and analytics, and creating new products and making the markets more efficient,&#8221; he said. And finally, in the last phase, the companies plan to move the most latency-sensitive parts of the workloads to the cloud.</p>
<p>As Moyer sees it, this is a huge deal and if it goes all the way through over a decade, it could transform how financial services companies like CME function. &#8220;So it&#8217;s really a phased approach, taking one of the largest and most diverse exchanges in the world up into the cloud. And along the way, Google intends to use its global network, its resiliency, its AI/ML, its data technologies, its global accessibility to enhance CMEs resiliency and accessibility on a worldwide basis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The big question aside from the overall scope of the deal is where the $1 billion investment fits in, and Moyer says it&#8217;s about showing CME that it too has skin in the game. The investment involves non-voting stock. There is no board seat and CME&#8217;s board is free to spend the money as it wishes. But Moyer says that the investment is about showing that Google is invested in the long-term success of the relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things that I would tell you that&#8217;s different about this relationship than maybe other kinds of traditional vendor relationships, where you just kind of get awarded an RFP or RFI, is that we&#8217;re committing to the engineering necessary to get to the finish line. And we&#8217;re not potentially starting years from now. We&#8217;re starting day one, on the journey together across all three phases,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are a lot of unknowns here, this is potentially a huge deal, which if successful, could open the wider financial services market to Google Cloud. Google has always had the advantage of running large cloud services at scale as part of its business. If it can start to capture other large-scale cloud businesses that can take advantage of that expertise, perhaps it can begin to move the market share needle in a more significant way.</p>
<p>Google was in third place in Q3 in the cloud infrastructure market with $4.5 billion in revenue, good for 10% market share. For some perspective, market leader AWS had more than $16 billion in revenue, good for 33% market share, according to numbers by <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synergy Research</a>. The overall market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">reached $45 billion in Q3</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric automaker that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">filed for an IPO</a>, has been sued by a former sales and marketing vice president for alleged gender discrimination.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Laura Schwab, a former sales and marketing executive who had a long employment history with Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin before joining Rivian in November 2020, was fired after reporting gender discrimination to the company&#8217;s human resources department. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in California Superior Court in Orange County.</p>
<p>A Rivian spokeswoman told TechCrunch that due to a quiet period ahead of its public offering, the company can&#8217;t offer comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Schwab also filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association and laid out her allegations in a <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post published on Medium</a>. The AAA statement, viewed by TechCrunch, describes a &#8220;toxic bro culture&#8221; at the company&#8217;s highest levels. The lawsuit alleges that Schwab was regularly ignored by her superior when trying to point out problems. She was regularly excluded from meetings attended by her male peers and decisions regarding her team were made without her input, the statement says. The AAA statement also says<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that her concerns regarding &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rivian&#8217;s misleading public statements and flawed business practices,&#8221; were dismissed. </span></p>
<p>When she spoke up to human resources about &#8220;the boys&#8217; club culture and gender discrimination she was experiencing from a C-level executive, Rivian abruptly fired her,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>
<p>In one excerpt on the blog, Schwab wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rivian publicly boasts about its culture, so it was a crushing blow when I joined the company and almost immediately experienced a toxic bro culture that marginalizes women and contributes to the company making mistakes. I raised concerns to HR about the gender discrimination from my manager, the &#8220;boys club&#8221; culture, and the impact it was having on me, my team, and the company. Two days later, my boss fired me.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The complaint comes as Amazon-backed Rivian prepares to become a publicly traded company in one of the most anticipated debuts of the year. A recent regulatory filing showed Rivian hoped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/">raise up $8.4 billion</a> in its initial public offering. The company plans to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also have an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise that option, Rivian would raise as much as $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Based on the number of outstanding shares, that would put its market valuation at about $53 billion. If employee stock options and other restricted shares are considered, Rivian&#8217;s valuation could be as high as $60 billion. Rivian filed October 1 to become a publicly traded company in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell American ride-hailing giant Uber <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2021/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> its third-quarter financial results. Critically, the long-unprofitable company managed to squeak $8 million worth of adjusted EBITDA &#8212; a very modified profit metric &#8212; while still posting net losses of more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>The adjusted-profit result comes days after Lyft, Uber&#8217;s domestic rival, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lyft-reports-adjusted-profitability-as-revenue-per-rider-rises/">recently managed the financial feat</a>.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Uber&#8217;s gross bookings (or the value of all goods and services that flowed through its platform) totaled $23.1 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. That figure translated to revenues of $4.8 billion, up 72% compared to the year-ago quarter. From that revenue figure Uber turned in a net loss of $2.4 billion, a figure inclusive of &#8220;a $2.0 billion net headwind&#8221; from the company revaluing its equity holdings in other companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s unadjusted per-share net losses came to $1.28, or a bit more than double the $0.62 it lost on a per-share basis in the year-ago third-quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the ride-hailing company to report a $0.33 per-share loss against revenues of $4.42 billion. Shares of the company are off around 5% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Before we get into segment performance, Uber indicated that it expects gross bookings of between $25 billion and $26 billion in the fourth quarter, leading to adjusted EBITDA of $25 to $75 million. Normally we&#8217;d mock a company of Uber&#8217;s scale and age for still forecasting with kids-table metrics like adjusted EBITDA instead of grown-up stats like GAAP net income. But as Uber has long promised investors that it would claw its way to the modified profit threshold this year, the guidance is worth noting.</p>
<h2>Segment performance</h2>
<p>Thinking broadly, Uber&#8217;s food delivery business drives far more of its total gross bookings than its ride-hailing business these days. In fact, it may be time to consider Uber more a food-delivery company than a taxi app.</p>
<p>Regardless, here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s segment breakdown in terms of gross spend:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229649" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229649" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229649 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=300,101 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=680,228 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>It is notable that ride-hailing is growing more quickly lately than food delivery at the company, but the swap makes some sense. Uber Eats grew like a weed during the pandemic, while moving people about lost its luster while folks stayed home. Now, with COVID abating in some markets, things are flipping back around.</p>
<p>Recall that Uber generates more revenue from rides than food, leading to the following top-line results from the above gross bookings:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229651" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229651" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229651 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="255" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>Near revenue-parity from taxi service and on-demand noshing feels notable, as does Uber&#8217;s Freight business generating enough top line for us to begin considering it a material piece of the company&#8217;s larger operational outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, to profitability, or, really, <em>adjusted EBITDA</em> results for each group:</p>

<p>As you can see, Uber has managed to drive its food business to nigh-adjusted breakeven status. That&#8217;s material progress compared to where the product was last year. And Uber&#8217;s ride business mostly canceled out its adjusted corporate losses. In sum, the company stuck a toe into adjusted-profitability land, posting $8 million worth of adjusted EBITDA, as we noted up top.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> impressive, frankly, is how far Uber managed to improve its adjusted EBITDA metric in just one year.</p>
<p>Taking into account all costs and expenses, Uber&#8217;s GAAP operating profit, however, came to -$572 million. And once interest costs and other expenses were taken into account, the former startup lost $2.44 billion in the period, or around $800 million per month. What drove the massive gap at Uber between its operating losses and its GAAP losses? Falling value of its investments. Per the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net, primarily represents a $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion net unrealized loss, respectively on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $994 million unrealized gain on our Zomato investment recognized during the third quarter of 2021, a $102 million and $573 million unrealized gain, respectively on our Aurora Investments, as well as a $73 million and $56 million net unrealized gain, respectively on our other investments in securities accounted for under the fair value option.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or more simply, the Chinese government&#8217;s annoyance with Didi led to Uber&#8217;s net income winding up in the shitter.</p>
<p>Summing, Uber remains unprofitable, but it is recovering from the pandemic and has managed, at last, to post adjusted incomes. Now let&#8217;s see it get to real breakeven.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A16z Crypto has been minting plenty of NFT unicorns this year. In July, they backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a> at a $1.5 billion valuation. They participated in a September raise for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs</a>, which valued the company at a whopping $7.6 billion. Just last month, they backed the team behind play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity with a $3 billion valuation.</p>
<p>While the NFT space in general is quite young, a16z&#8217;s latest unicorn NFT bet is a bit earlier than usual. <a href="https://mythicalgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mythical Games</a> is raising a $150 million Series C from the firm at a $1.25 billion valuation just a few months after it closed a whopping $75 million Series B. Mythical Games&#8217; sole title Blankos Block Party is an NFT-based game that&#8217;s only been in &#8220;early access&#8221; for a few months and has a player base of monthly active users just in the &#8220;high tens of thousands,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t planning on raising for quite a few more months,&#8221; CEO John Linden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And [a16z crypto] came to us early and they kind of preempted everybody else. They knew we weren&#8217;t raising but they said, &#8216;Hey, let&#8217;s do this now&#8230;&#8217; And we&#8217;re sitting in such a great position now where we have many years of capital at this point.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228855" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>There actually aren&#8217;t too many crypto gaming startups out there, but a good chunk of them are built by crypto founders with crypto economics at the center of every part of the titles. As a result, most blockchain games have pretty advanced economies and pretty rudimentary gameplay.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Mythical Games has struck a nerve with investors is that they&#8217;re a team of gaming industry veterans who are building a platform that is gameplay first, blockchain-based investment-platform second. The studio&#8217;s main title Blankos Block Party feels much less crypto-centric than other NFT titles. It&#8217;s a polished game that looks pretty similar to the title Fall Guys, but boasts a revenue model that combines a BattlePass-style subscription with a non-crypto in-game currency that users can buy NFTs with and then sell for real cash on a secondary marketplace.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of NFTs of user avatars or accessories have already been minted on the platform, where users can also sell the goods they&#8217;ve purchased with in-game currency for actual cash, part of a broader &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; mechanic which rewards users for investing time in the platform. Users can choose to navigate all of this without ever touching cryptocurrencies. Linden says that Mythical Games will continue to get &#8220;deeper and deeper&#8221; into crypto mechanics, but notes that they&#8217;re looking to tread carefully as they gauge where to stick to conventions and where to push the limits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mythical Games&#8217; unicorn status is a bet from a16z Crypto that game developers are potentially going to be interested in as a more subtle embrace of blockchain-based in-game economies. The studio has been <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/02/mythical-games-announces-partners-for-blockchain-game-economy-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with a handful of smaller studios</a> to integrate some of their infrastructure, including marketplace services, compliance tech, token management and access to their custom blockchain. They&#8217;re generally looking to build a path forward for the gaming industry adopting more complex in-game economies based around NFTs while also ensuring users aren&#8217;t left navigating a web of crypto confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;To us, this is the future of gaming,&#8221; a16z Crypto general partner Arianna Simpson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;This is the future of how people will expect to play games and participate and be rewarded for the time and the investments that they make on these platforms. And this is a multitrillion-dollar market, without question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blockchain-based mechanics can be a tough sell for game studios today largely because it&#8217;s still a pretty hostile platform environment for NFT-based titles at the moment. Apple and Google haven&#8217;t showcased much of an interest in building a path for crypto payments or NFT sales inside their mobile app stores while Steam has outright banned NFT titles from their PC game store, a move which directly impacted Blankos. Part of this has undoubtedly been the desire of platforms not to upend the in-game payment systems that have made them rich, but there are also legal uncertainties around how deeply some titles are wading into securities territory.</p>
<p>For now, Blankos is only available as a desktop PC client directly downloadable from their own website. They don&#8217;t have mobile apps and they aren&#8217;t available on any PC game stores. Even without accessibility on mobile today, a16z Crypto sees a big opportunity for Blankos and crypto gaming in general. &#8220;I think mobile is definitely going to be an important part of the story going forward. There&#8217;s no doubt about that, but desktop is still huge,&#8221; Simpson says. &#8220;If you look at it even today, the majority of the highest value transactions are happening on desktop.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goodlyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodly</a>, a three-year-old, San Francisco-based startup, has been steadily building its business with a five-person team and not much funding &#8212; $1.5 million secured in 2019 and, more recently, an undisclosed amount of funding from Beth Axelrod, a longtime HR exec and the global head of employee experience at Airbnb.</p>
<p>The startup, which aims to make it dead simple for companies to offer tax-free student loan repayment as an employee benefit, is profitable. It has exclusive relationships with numerous brokers, including insurer NFP and the much larger Willis Towers Watson. Still, its product wasn&#8217;t exactly top of mind during the pandemic, when enterprises became consumed with their focus on remote work and trying to ensure their employees&#8217; mental well-being.</p>
<p>Sailing into 2022, that could be changing  for two reasons. One ties to a provision within the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 that allows employers to contribute up to an annual maximum of $5,250 per employee to repay student debt. Those contributions from the company are tax deductible for employers but also are excluded from taxable income for employees, which will seemingly give companies a much larger financial incentive to provide them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Second, after more than 20 months of temporary student loan forbearance for millions of student loan borrowers, student loan relief is ending on January 31, which means that beginning in February, federal loan payments will resume with their normal (and normally onerous) interest rates. That means an issue that has been shelved for some time will suddenly jump to the forefront, and in a competitive job market, companies would probably be wise to take note.</p>
<p>Certainly, Goodly CEO Gregory Poulin &#8212; who was among the earliest employees at Parker Conrad&#8217;s Rippling, along with co-founder and CTO Hemant Verma &#8212; has a compelling pitch should they decide to investigate further. As Poulin told us earlier this week, while $5,250 may not seem like much, it can add up in surprising ways over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the average company that we work with, we usually see around $100 per participant per month being the most common contribution,&#8221; he says, comparing the cost to a cup of coffee per day. But taking that employer contribution and applying it as a payment directly to the principal of student loan also helps address the issue of compounding interest over the lifetime of the loan, which is where people really get into trouble.</p>
<p>Poulin says the typical repayment period is about 10 years and that Goodly can reduce that repayment period by three to four years depending on the outstanding balance of an employee&#8217;s loan. That doesn&#8217;t square exactly with the data that we&#8217;re seeing and which shows that repayment periods actually average closer to 20 years, but obviously if Goodly can help someone save even a year of loan payments, that&#8217;s something employers can use as a sweetener.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the startup&#8217;s tech is fairly straightforward. Each user of Goodly is given their own account, where they can manage and track their student loans from its dashboard. From there, employees can also access content like financial wellness counseling, or the best strategies for optimizing repayments.</p>
<p>Poulin adds that one especially popular feature is the ability for employees to invite their friends or family to make a contribution toward their student loans that functions in a similar way to crowdfunding, wherein a parent or grandparent can make a one-time or a recurring contribution. &#8220;And of course, that contributor has peace of mind in knowing that payment is being directed to that student loan and not spent on anything else,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Goodly passed through Y Combinator shortly after its launch in 2018. Poulin says he was inspired to launch the business after the sudden death of his own father while he was a student at Dartmouth, after which he found himself having to borrow $80,000 in student loans.</p>
<p>Years later, he says his payment is still more than $900 a month.</p>
<p>He has a lot of company, unfortunately. As of last year, there were 45 million borrowers who collectively owed nearly $1.6 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S., and for too many of them, it can become crushing. &#8220;It really creates a two-tiered workplace where those with student loans are in a lot of ways, second-class citizens,&#8221; says Poulin, &#8220;because by the age of 30, people with student debt hold about half the retirement savings of their peers without student loans,&#8221; causing them to delay homeownership, getting married and having children.</p>
<p>If Goodly has its way, when student debt regains mindshare in 2022, more employers will begin to recognize the issue &#8212; and do more to help their employees mitigate the cycle.</p>

		<a href="linkedin.com/in/jonathan-yoni-frenkel-7a189562"> Jonathan "Yoni" Frenkel</a> is a content strategist and founder of <a href="https://www.ykc.today/">YKC Media</a>, a digital marketing agency that works with the global tech/venture/startup community. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">On the surface, it’s impressive that Israel has nearly as many unicorns as the European Union with a population almost 50 times smaller. It may seem odd to suggest that the gap can grow still larger. And yet, it is so.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem is like a flywheel. When founders sell or go public, money floods into the ecosystem in three ways. The first, obviously, is the injection of liquidity from investors.</p>
<p>The second effect is the creation of new investors. There is truth to the idea that the newly wealthy founders (and employees) first buy a house &#8212; and then start investing in startups themselves. And third, venture capital flows to those who have shown successful innovation in the past &#8212; a halo effect that is as evident in Israel as it is in San Francisco.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225837" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These things happened with early employees of companies like Google, Uber and Twitter, who became investors or founders. And a version of it is happening in Israel, where it is not uncommon for employees to manifest total conviction that they can do better than the founders who brought them riches.</p>
<p>Being employee No. 10 at an Israeli success story like Monday.com or SentinelOne is somewhat akin to being employee No. 15 at Uber or Instagram: The companies may offer somewhat less of a halo &#8212; but not <em>that</em> much less. These employees-turned-founders have skills and backgrounds sought by investors. And Israeli <em>chutzpah</em> can sometimes do the rest.</p>
<p>That’s why Israel is pushing 100 unicorns — privately held companies (essentially all in tech) valued at a billion dollars or more. Compare that with Europe, which has a much larger population and just <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/europe-fintech-unicorn-startups/#:~:text=All%20told%2C%20there%20are%20now,in%20the%20financial%20services%20sector.">125 unicorns</a>. It is a success so profound that it begs for explanation.</p>
<p>For starters, Europe’s business culture is far more risk-averse than Israel’s, for reasons grounded in its past success. There are easier ways to make a good living in much of the EU, while in Israel, with its less established legacy economy, tech entrepreneurship was long a more appealing path.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That paradigm was right for a scrappy society that has never known true peace and is composed mostly of immigrants or their children. It’s an origin story that begets a spirit of adventure — and also its cousins, innovation and entrepreneurship. Add to that the technology driven by the security industry and military, which are a result of the wars, and throw in mass emigration from the post-arms-race Soviet Union, and you have a story.</p>
<p>In a new wrinkle, add to that the COVID factor. Israel was able to come out of the pandemic somehow stronger due to an early bet on vaccines and the fact that its outside tech sector (accounting for perhaps a tenth of the workforce) was well suited for remote work. Furthermore, Israel pulled in significant VC funds during the period.</p>
<p>This is happening at the right time. Israeli companies, already punching above their weight in areas like cyber, fintech and SaaS, are showing tremendous promise in verticals like food tech, agritech, space tech and, of course, vaccines.</p>
<p>But this is where the picture grows gloomier: A major roadblock may prevent Israel from realizing this potential.</p>
<p>On the surface, it would <em>appear</em> that Israel is well equipped for supplying workers to its industry. Indeed, this <a href="https://utahisrael.com/why-israel/">data</a> shows Israel with 135 scientists and engineers for every 10,000 citizens, “more than any other developed country.” But it is not enough for the demands created by the burgeoning tech sector.</p>
<p>The 2020 High-Tech Human Capital Report from the Israel Innovation Authority and Start-Up Nation Central found that <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3905770,00.html">60% of tech firms were having trouble finding workers</a> and that there were currently 13,000 unfilled tech job openings in the country. Various recent studies found <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3905770,00.html">chronic shortages</a> of engineers; September reportedly saw <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-job-vacancies-in-israel-hit-record-as-joblessness-rises-1001387595">14,000 engineer vacancies.</a></p>
<p>This shortfall in supply is pushing up the cost of labor, making <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1000616569">Israeli engineers much more expensive</a> than their counterparts in most countries. In an era of remote work, this drives employers to outsource work to countries like Ukraine and Romania, a trend that does not bode well for continuing to bottle the special sauce of “Startup Nation.”</p>
<p>Other things are moving in the wrong direction. Israeli students’ international test scores in math, science and reading are <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-student-scores-fall-in-international-test-while-arabs-scores-drop-the-most-1.8221701">plummeting</a> compared to those of other countries, largely because of massive political dysfunction: Successive governments have allowed the unimpeded growth of ultra-religious schools that often do not teach math at all.</p>
<p>This relates to the wider issue of the amazing expansion of the ultra-Orthodox sector, where half the men study religion full time (and most of the other half toil in a vast religious services bureaucracy) and women are dedicated to raising more than seven children each on average. Another sector that does not participate proportionately in the tech economy is the Israeli Arab one, a <a href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/33553">historically underprivileged and underfunded</a> community that lives with high crime rates.</p>
<p>One obvious approach would be to encourage ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli Arabs to integrate into wider Israel and be given every tool. Underfunding of the Israeli Arab towns and schools must end (a process that is <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-mansour-abbas-doubles-budget-for-arab-sector-1001374021">beginning with baby steps this year</a>, with an Arab party joining the new coalition), and the government must order the police to crack down on <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/man-gunned-down-in-deir-al-asad-marking-100th-arab-israeli-homicide-in-2021/">rampant criminality in the sector</a>. Funding should be denied to any schools that do not teach math or science (one of <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/the-real-threat-to-modern-israel/">many steps</a> needed to integrate the ultra-Orthodox).</p>
<p>The Israeli government should seize the initiative through public-private partnerships — the very approach that in the past helped incubate and fund promising startups — that would target ways to improve the education system. The goals are the same: accelerating the economy. Israel needs to tackle education with the same gusto it directed at the Iron Dome or dealing with its adversaries.</p>
<p>Possibilities include improving STEM education (science, technology, engineering and math), particularly in the periphery; improving teachers’ pay; limiting how aggressively parents can intervene; incentivizing outside programs like Fullstack Academy and other coding academies to open schools in Israel; and working with tech giants like Wix to further develop Silicon Valley-style campuses nurturing local talent.</p>
<p>Starting students earlier by teaching coding and programming could help units of the military focused on R&amp;D and cognitive areas, broadening recruitment to new population groups and, in turn, creating new employees for the tech sector.</p>
<p>None of this will be easy, but the cost of complacency is high. To do nothing and hope for the best is worse than nothing. It would fritter away a monumental gift that the inscrutable fates have somehow bestowed upon the Jewish state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/gwoop-academy-wants-to-help-you-get-better-at-video-games/">Earlier this year</a> I wrote about <a href="https://gwoop.com/">Gwoop</a>, a team out of Minnesota building a collection of browser-based games meant to help you get better at video games overall. Their games measure things like how quickly you react, how accurately you move the mouse or how quickly you can aim at a randomly placed target, then provides all those stats in a dashboard to show how you&#8217;re improving (hopefully) over time.</p>
<p>Last time I talked with Gwoop co-founder Gavin Lee, he was already hinting at dreams of being the go-to analytics/training tool for the increasing number of high school esports teams. More and more schools are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/24/798172352/as-esports-take-off-high-school-leagues-get-in-the-game">starting to take esports seriously</a> — and just like any other kind of coach, esports coaches need some way to see who&#8217;s good at what, track player improvements over time and run their players through warmup drills.</p>
<p>It seems Gwoop is already making solid progress there; Lee tells me that Gwoop is now working with &#8220;about 1,000 school programs across 40 states.&#8221; Now they&#8217;ve raised a $1.85 million seed round to keep that ball rolling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gwoop&#8217;s platform is, and will continue to be, free for individual players — something that Lee tells me he sees as crucial. So how will they make money?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229561" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229561" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2229561" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="565" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg 1916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=1536,847 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gwoop-analytics.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gwoop</p></div></p>
<p>Over the last few months the company has been building out &#8220;Gwoop Teams,&#8221; which, as the name implies, is built for groups training together. Through Teams, coaches are able to assign training regimens, check in to see if players are practicing and see how each player is improving over time.</p>
<p>The base version of Teams is free, supporting a roster of up to 30 players and two &#8220;parties&#8221; — one &#8220;party&#8221; for grouping your Rocket League players, another for your League of Legends players, your Fortnite players, etc. For coaches that need more than that, Gwoops &#8220;Team Plus&#8221; offering bumps the roster up to 150 players and increases the number of parties a coach can oversee. Lee tells me that Teams Plus costs about $350 a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Another area that Lee tells me they&#8217;re exploring, though its early days: using machine learning to help players (and their coaches) identify the games they&#8217;d already be good at based on their existing skills and ranks in other competitive games.</p>
<p>Lee tells me that this round was backed by Montreal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.angelsofmany.com">Angels of Many</a>, Klein Investments and a number of angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The field of drug discovery has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/quris-combines-ai-with-patient-on-a-chip-to-speed-drug-development-and-reduce-animal-testing/">supercharged by the capabilities of AI</a>, which several companies have applied in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/genesis-therapeutics-raises-52m-a-round-for-its-ai-focused-drug-discovery-mission/">various ways</a> to turn an enormous practical problem into a tractable information problem. The latest to do so is Google parent company Alphabet, which has established <a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isomorphic Labs</a>, under DeepMind head Demis Hassabis, to take its shot at the promising new field.</p>
<p>Very little was revealed about the company in <a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut blog post</a> and a very general accompanying FAQ. The aim of the company is to &#8220;build a computational platform to understand biological systems from first principles to discover new ways to treat disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are, of course, a few assumptions baked into that founding statement, most prominently that it&#8217;s possible to computationally simulate biological systems in a matter conducive to drug discovery.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Several large companies have been formed and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/">funded with hundreds of millions</a> of dollars to pursue very similar goals over the last five years or so, and there has been no visible revolution or famous AI-discovered wonder drug for a previously untreatable disease. The reasons why are beyond the scope of this article (and will no doubt be engaged with by Isomorphic Labs in the near future) but it is clear these AI systems are not miracle factories, just parts in a long and complex process that still involves a great deal of time, money and test tubes.</p>
<p>Hassabis is no fool, and although he describes biology rather optimistically as &#8220;an information processing system, albeit an extraordinarily complex and dynamic one,&#8221; (I can sense the readers in this field scrolling down to the comments now) he tempers that shortly afterwards:</p>
<blockquote><p>Biology is likely far too complex and messy to ever be encapsulated as a simple set of neat mathematical equations. But just as mathematics turned out to be the right description language for physics, biology may turn out to be the perfect type of regime for the application of AI.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea that information systems and biological systems may have a common structure is the inspiration for the name, Isomorphic Systems; <em>isomorphic</em> means alike in shape but having a different origin.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Sdv9SteLfQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">DeepMind puts the entire human proteome online, as folded by AlphaFold</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeepMind puts the entire human proteome online, as folded by AlphaFold&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/embed/#?secret=Sdv9SteLfQ" data-secret="Sdv9SteLfQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>His reasoning for this is no doubt partly from the effectiveness of DeepMind&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">AlphaFold</a>, an AI-powered protein folding system that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">blew biologists&#8217; socks off last year</a> and helped create a new normal in a very complex field.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s learning systems have shown <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/no-rules-no-problem-deepminds-muzero-masters-games-while-learning-how-to-play-them/">a particular affinity</a> for generality or knowledge transfer — that is, having a structure that is capable of being repurposed for very different tasks. And if, as AlphaFold&#8217;s success suggests, biological systems are a good match for this kind of simulation and analysis, Hassabis&#8217;s assessment of the company&#8217;s wider capabilities may prove true.</p>
<p>If so, it won&#8217;t be for a while. Even with the running start provided by DeepMind&#8217;s AI research (which will remain separate but may be shared), Isomorphic is essentially starting from scratch on this problem. It&#8217;s hiring up a &#8220;world-class multidisciplinary team&#8221; and perhaps in a year or two we may see the first inklings of results issuing from the company&#8217;s ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K.&#8217;s recently appointed secretary of state for digital, Nadine Dorries, has signalled she wants to take a tougher line on social media platforms than her predecessor &#8212; telling a parliamentary committee she&#8217;s looking at speeding up the application of criminal sanctions for breaches of incoming U.K. online safety legislation.</p>
<p>A provision to hold named individuals criminally accountable for failing to tackle illegal or harmful content spreading on their platforms was included in the draft Online Safety bill &#8212; but deferred for two years.</p>
<p>In an evidence session earlier <a href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/6cc46469-1a1f-4ac0-bd12-d0a308b90a97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today</a>, Dorries told the joint committee examining the bill that she wants to accelerate that time frame &#8212; potentially cutting the deferral of criminal liability powers down to as little as three to six months after the bill becomes law.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The bill was published in draft form <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">back in May</a>, and last month Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested it will be presented to parliament before Christmas &#8212; although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/20/boris-johnson-promises-online-harms-bill-debate-before-christmas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports have suggested</a> that time frame may slip. Nonetheless, given Johnson&#8217;s whacking Commons majority, it seems likely the bill will make it onto the statute books in 2022.</p>
<p>So, if Dorries gets her way, criminal liability for tech CEOs could be coming to the U.K. as soon as next year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/embed/#?secret=69FXzkcYBH" data-secret="69FXzkcYBH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dorries argued that tech giants already know the changes they need to make to remove illegal content (like terrorism) and legal but harmful content (like pro-anorexia or self-harm content) from their platforms &#8212; implying they are holding off for financial reasons. Hence the tacit suggestion is that a pressing threat of criminal sanctions is needed to concentrate tech giants&#8217; minds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;To platforms, take note now,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;It will not be two years &#8212; we are looking at truncating it to a very much shorter time frame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the areas as the secretary of state that I want to go further with this bill,&#8221; she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a nonsense that platforms have been given two years to get themselves ready for what would be criminal action. They know what they are doing now. They actually have the ability to put right what they&#8217;re doing wrong now. They have the ability now to abide by their own terms and conditions. They could remove harmful algorithms tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The need for Facebook to make changes to its algorithm to reduce virality and prevent the amplification of misinformation has been a key call of the Facebook whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Frances Haugen</a>, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">came forward last month</a> as the source of a trove of leaked internal documents and has accused the tech giant of prioritizing profit over safety.</p>
<p>The notion of harmful algorithms and a systematic lack of attention to safety appears to have resonated with U.K. lawmakers who have spent years drafting legislation that&#8217;s intended to reboot platforms&#8217; attitudes around content by enforcing a duty of care.</p>
<p>Pointing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">Facebook&#8217;s recent rebranding to &#8220;Meta&#8221;</a> &#8212; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">self-trumpeted pivot toward directly massive resource into building &#8220;the metaverse&#8221;</a> &#8212; Dorries said the tech giant should instead apply the labour of the circa 10,000-20,000 engineers it wants to use to develop metaverse technology toward online safety and protecting children from internet content horrors.</p>
<p>Here she was directly echoing a point made by Haugen in her own earlier evidence to the U.K. committee &#8212; when she described herself as &#8220;shocked&#8221; that Facebook wants to &#8220;double down on the metaverse&#8221; &#8212; and suggested that the under-resourced safety teams inside the company, such as the civic integrity team where she worked, could have done many things to improve safety and reduce algorithmic amplification of toxic content if they had been given 10,000 engineers.</p>
<p>Instead, Haugen said, Facebook&#8217;s safety teams struggled with chronic under-resourcing because the tech giant simply views safety &#8220;as a cost&#8221;, emphasizing that it is up to regulators to force platforms to prioritize safety.</p>
<p>Firing her own rocket at Facebook&#8217;s founder Mark Zuckerberg and his chief spin doctor, Nick Clegg &#8212; who happens to be a former liberal democrat MP (and deputy U.K. PM) &#8212; Dorries warned: &#8220;Rebranding does not work.</p>
<p>&#8220;When harm is caused we are coming after it. Put those 10K or 20K engineers now onto abiding by your terms and conditions and to removing your harmful algorithms because if you don&#8217;t this bill will be watertight.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Platforms know now, they know today, they know what they&#8217;re doing wrong. They have a chance to put that right absolutely right now &#8212; why would we give them two years?&#8221; she added, hammering her point into rhetoric by reiterating the question. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;People like Mark Zuckerberg and Nick Clegg who are wanting to take off into the metaverse,&#8221; Dorries went on. &#8220;My advice would be: &#8216;Stay in the real world&#8217;. Because this bill is going to be an act very, very soon and it&#8217;s the algorithms that do the harm, and this act will be there and you will be accountable to this act.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caveated that her preferred truncated time frame for criminal liability still requires sign-off through standard parliamentary and legislative procedures. But she told the committee she&#8217;s pressing hard for three to six months for criminal liability &#8212; which opens up a path for senior tech executives to be prosecuted for safety failures in the near future.</p>
<p>(Although it&#8217;s fair to say that the risk of criminal liability would most likely shrink down to zero the chance of Zuckerberg or Clegg ever personally setting foot back on U.K. soil. After all, the Facebook founder has already shown he&#8217;s willing to avoid the U.K. entirely in order to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/zuckerberg-again-snubs-uk-parliament-over-call-to-testify/">evade parliamentary scrutiny</a>. Enforced exile for Clegg, who is British, may sting rather more though&#8230; )</p>
<p>During her testimony to the committee, Dorries also predicted that the Online Safety Bill will change internet culture for good.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that there will be huge, huge [change]. This will set off a culture change in terms of our online environments and landscape,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There will be huge kickback. Because you have to follow the money &#8212; people are making a huge amount of money from these platforms and sites. And of course there will be kickback. But we must not forget the world is watching what we are doing in terms of legislating to hold those platforms to account. That is why it has to be watertight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee questioned Dorries closely on whether the bill gives enough powers to the independent regulator, Ofcom, which will be responsible for overseeing and enforcing the online safety rules &#8212; to ensure platforms can&#8217;t just wiggle through gaps and loopholes. Notably they were concerned about risk assessments, an area which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">Haugen had given detailed suggestions on</a>.</p>
<p>The secretary of state said she was &#8220;assured&#8221; that the bill does give Ofcom adequate powers, including around transparency issues. She also emphasized the &#8220;substantial&#8221; fines it can issue, noting that the bill&#8217;s regime of financial penalties scales to up to 10% of global turnover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ofcom, I believe, with the regulatory framework we have set, has the powers to request full transparency of how those algorithms are used and promoted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We think that Ofcom have the powers to lift the lid on the algorithms &#8212; and they have the powers to set huge fines.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dorries also said she&#8217;s keen to see the committee recommendations for beefing up the bill &#8212; and would be &#8220;open&#8221; to relevant suggestions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can reassure you that if you have recommendations and they can pass parliamentary council and they will not dilute the scope of the bill and that they are in line with the three core principles and they will help to make this bill watertight and groundbreaking and assist with the novel nature of this bill &#8212; if there is something that we can see helps deliver we will be very much open to your recommendations,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Given what she described as the &#8220;novel&#8221; nature of the online safety legislation, Dorries said it&#8217;s her view that ongoing monitoring will be vital &#8212; suggesting a joint parliamentary committee format may be required to &#8220;keep a watching brief&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the bill goes far enough in terms of scrutiny,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For example there is a clause in the bill which says that in two to five years we have to re-examine &#8212; that is not good enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why it&#8217;s not good enough is because when this bill, the idea of this bill, the genesis, TikTok had not even been heard of. It&#8217;s a rapidly changing landscape and therefore I think it&#8217;s exceptional in terms of the parliamentary scrutiny required.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know what is doing to happen the day after this bill receives royal assent&#8230;. I think there is a role for a committee like yours to continue to work in the same way that the human rights joint committee does to continue to work to scrutinise this bill moving forward,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">TechCrunch ran my TC-1 about Bowery Farming</a>. What began as a piece about a heartily financed New York startup ballooned into an exploration about an emerging field with a rich and fascinating history. I sought to answer some big questions about the efficacy, profitability and sustainability of vertical farming. I would be lying if I told you that I emerged from the other side with satisfactory answers &#8212; no doubt all of the above will be clear over time.</p>
<p>I did, however, get the opportunity to talk to several fascinating folks with myriad views on all of the above. One of the folks I kept coming back to was Dickson Despommier &#8212; widely regarded as the godfather of vertical farming. It was in his Columbia University courses that many of the fundamental concepts around vertical farming were developed over a number of years.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/8ab2d909-1682-49ab-91ca-c624d0573899?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>His 2010 book, &#8220;The Vertical Farm,&#8221; has also proven a foundational text for many. Last year, he marked the book’s 10th anniversary with a new edition that offers an afterword reflecting on much of what has transpired in the intervening decade. “In 2010, when this book was first published, there were no vertical farms,” Despommier writes in a new chapter. “As of this writing, there are so many vertical farms, I don’t know exactly how many exist.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223046" style="width: 562px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223046" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2223046 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg?w=552" alt="" width="552" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg 730w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg?resize=243,300 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg?resize=552,680 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DDD.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223046" class="wp-caption-text">Dickson Despommier of Columbia University and author of &#8220;The Vertical Farm.&#8221; <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dickson Despommier</p></div></p>
<p>The author certainly has much to celebrate. Vertical farms now number in the hundreds across the world. Startups and governments alike are exploring the technology amid concerns around climate change, overpopulation and overfarming. As I noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/on-ten-years-of-the-vertical-farm/">in my recent review</a>, the book is not an instruction manual, so much as a piece of utopian text exploring what could be with sufficient funding, technologies and follow-through. This is the story Despommier wants to tell, and frankly, it’s hard to blame him. In a world bogged down by streams of relentlessly depressing news, it’s nice to have the occasional bit of utopian idealism, however realistic it may or may not ultimately be.</p>
<p>It seemed appropriate to bookend the review by talking to Despommier and revisiting some of the book’s ideas and idealism. While the book got much right in the abstract, &#8220;The Vertical Farm&#8221; missed some of the finer details on precisely how these farms would look and act.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I had a good picture of me, sort of kneeling down on the road with my I had my camera and I took a picture of the Apple Store on 59th Street and Central Park West,” explains Despommier. “I thought this is the way the vertical farm is gonna look. It just has to look this way. And it&#8217;s just the opposite. It&#8217;s just what you want to do is to keep out sunlight, because it contains wavelengths of light that actually inhibit plant furrows. And who knew that until you started to use LED lights, and you could tune and then you could see the red and the blue, little bit of green. And you throw that together and you leave out all the other visible spectra. And you&#8217;ve now made it much more efficient and the plants grow twice as fast.”</p>
<p>The model that we’ve seen thus far is more akin to a factory than a greenhouse. Large, windowless buildings that once served as fulfillment centers now house farms, powered by LED technologies, rather than the sun &#8212; the world’s largest renewable power source. Energy consumption remains one of the biggest question marks around this technology. Proponents insist that it’s a net positive for the environment over more traditional agricultural methods. For my part, I feel pretty strongly that the jury is still out &#8212; though it seems plausible that emerging technologies could move the needle. For his part, Despommier points to technologies like photovoltaics, water harvesting and cross-laminated timber construction as keys to achieving those ends.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223047" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223047" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2223047 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?w=443" alt="" width="443" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg 1611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=768,1180 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=443,680 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=1000,1536 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=1333,2048 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Vertical-Farm-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223047" class="wp-caption-text">Cover of The Vertical Farm, 10th anniversary edition. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Picador</p></div></p>
<p>“We want the city to become a mutualistic symbiont,” says Despommier. “That’s a fancy term for it helps the countryside survive by not taking advantage of it. Today, for instance, where I am, it&#8217;s raining. Every building out there should have a rain harvesting system built into the roof system. And they should have a storage system. And they should use that water for heating and cooling as well as for bathing and drinking and even part of the vertical farm.”</p>
<p>For his vision to truly be achieved, however, innovation will need to go on a capitalist-driven startup model. Governments will have to take a more aggressive role in realizing these technologies in an effort to minimize the inevitable impact of human-made climate change.</p>
<p>“The United States Department of Agriculture&#8217;s had five or six regional meetings already on [vertical farming],” he says. “I was a participant in two of those in Washington, DC, and very high-level people were at that meeting. You were allowed to speak your mind, you could say whatever you wanted, you could pooh-pooh the idea, or you could tout it way beyond its potential. And we had both of those sides of the story being spoken at the same time. You can now find on the website for the USDA a section devoted to indoor farming.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let’s explore just how much more money fintech startups in Latin America are raising this year before turning to discuss the logic behind the influx. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of all the startup markets in the world, fintech in Latin America is one of the hottest. Capital is flowing into the region’s financial technology companies at a slicing pace, leading to a wave of startups that are building private-market value at a simply astounding rate.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of capital flowing into LatAm fintech startups may appear overheated, but several reasons explain why the flood makes sense. This isn’t to say that every deal and every resulting valuation markup is logical. But there are several factors in play that make the booming venture capital totals these companies are raising more reasonable than they might initially appear.</p>

<p>And finally, the Latin American fintech market is seeing exit volume pick up, not only implying that capital can be returned to investors who bid up the region’s startups, but also that funds previously preserved in private-market amber and recently made liquid can be reinvested in startups, creating a virtuous circle.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly chew on just how much more money fintech startups in Latin America are raising this year before turning to discuss the logic behind the influx.</p>
<h2>A rising tide of capital</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q3-2021/">CB Insights data</a> indicates that despite rapid growth from 2015 to 2020, when Latin American fintechs raised $138 million and $3.14 billion, respectively, 2021 stands apart from other years in terms of growth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229109" style="width: 1194px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229109" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2229109 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png" alt="" width="1184" height="461" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png 1184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png?resize=768,299 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png?resize=680,265 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-11.12.14-AM.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1184px) 100vw, 1184px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229109" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CB Insights</p></div></p>
<p>It’s proved somewhat common to see rising dollar volume for any particular venture capital market or startup category reach new highs in recent quarters. But we’ve seen such records come often with flat, or perhaps even lower, deal volume. That is not the case with LatAm fintech; both dollars and deals in the region are going to smash through 2020 and 2019’s superlatives, and indeed have already done so.</p>
<p>The dollar result will wind up more impressive than the deal figure, but both are set to crush prior totals.</p>
<p>Narrowing our vision to quarter tallies over yearly and year-to-date results, Latin American fintech startups just had the second best quarter on record. The startup cohort’s Q3 2021 period was only beaten by Q2 2021; if we excise the second quarter, for reference, Q3 2021 itself is more than a double of any prior quarterly record.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space is back!</a></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Happening this December 14 and 15 — our second dedicated space event. This is a live, virtual two-day event featuring the most important people in the space industry, across public, private and defense.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to be hosting Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck, Accion Systems CEO and founder Natalya Bailey, Lockheed Martin VP and head of civil space programs Lisa Callahan and many more. In addition to the firesides and panel discussions on the virtual stage, the event will also include networking, startup exhibits and the chance to connect with attendees from around the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228551" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Below, you’ll find an early sneak peek of the agenda. It’s a packed two days already, but we’ve got some extra surprises in store, so keep an eye on the agenda over the coming weeks for more great speakers and sessions we’re adding.</p>
<p>If you want to be a part of this event, you can grab a ticket to get exclusive access to watch these sessions live (with access to video on demand), network with the innovators changing the space industry, discover the hottest early-stage companies, learn how to score grants for your space company, recruit talent or even find a job. General admission tickets are just $115. And we have discounts available for groups, students, active military/government employees and for early-stage space startup founders who want to give their startup some extra visibility.</p>
<p>Our agenda showcases some of the powerhouses in space, but also plenty of smaller teams that are building and debunking fundamental technologies in the industry. Check it out!</p>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>The Full Service Space Company<br />
</strong></span>with Peter Beck (Rocket Lab)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rocket Lab&#8217;s 2021 saw it enter the public markets, announce brand new spacecraft, acquire companies and more. We&#8217;ll talk to Peter Beck about what the one-time dedicated launch company is turning into through all this growth and change.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>New Kids on the Launch Block<br />
</strong></span>with Max Haot (Launcher), Benjamin Lyon (Astra) and Lauren Lyons (Firefly Aerospace)</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Being There When Stars Form<br />
</strong></span>with Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars) and Jessica Robinson (Assembly Ventures)</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the earliest stages, space companies are at their riskiest. But these investors are willing to wade in and write checks to help those companies gain their footing. Hear from Space Capital, Techstars and Assembly Ventures about how they pick their winners.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Backing the Brightest<br />
</strong></span>with Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners), Shaun Maguire (Sequoia) and Lisa Rich (Hemisphere Ventures)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s an art to later-stage space company funding, especially as the exit picture for the sector is still only just starting to take shape. We’ll talk to Bessemer Venture Partners, Sequoia and Hemisphere Ventures how they evaluate which companies are looking primed for growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Maneuvering Towards Better In-space Propulsion<br />
</strong></span>with Natalya Bailey (Accion Systems), István Lőrincz (Morpheus Space) and speaker to be announced</h3>
<ul>
<li>What goes up must come down, but we can delay that second part a bit with better propulsion on our satellites and spacecraft. Accion, Morpheus and other companies pushing the boundaries of in-space propulsion will discuss the challenges and opportunities in changing how in-space assets move about.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Empowering and Protecting In-space Operations<br />

</strong></span>with Richard Cooke (Esri) and James Slifierz (SkyWatch)</h3>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re not short of eyes in the sky, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy to collect and use the data that Earth observation networks create. Find out how mapping veteran Esri and startup SkyWatch are building out data infrastructure that makes orbital imagery accessible and profitable.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Robots, Meet Regolith: A New Generation of Lunar Landers and Rovers<br />
</strong></span>with Lisa Callahan (Lockheed Martin Space), Sean Mahoney (Masten Space Systems) and Takahiro Nakamura (ispace)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The moon is back on the menu with Artemis and a dozen other missions, and companies like Lockheed Martin, Masten Space Systems and ispace are building a new generation of robotic explorers and surveyors to roam around its surface. Hear how they design for the moon&#8217;s unforgiving surface and what robots can do to help prepare for human arrival.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric truck developer Nikola Corp. is in talks with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission to pay a $125 million civil penalty, part of an ongoing probe by the regulator into whether the company mislead investors, the company reported in its third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Nikola would pay the settlement in installments, and had earmarked the funds in anticipation of a resolution, the company said in its third-quarter earnings results.</p>
<p>Based on the advancement of discussions with the SEC in October 2021, Nikola &#8220;reserved a $125 million loss as its best estimate of the contingency in accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2021,&#8221; the company&#8217;s earnings report said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229145" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nikola’s beleaguered founder, Trevor Milton, has been busy with his own criminal defense. He faces two separate charges: one from the SEC, for alleged violations of securities law, and a criminal indictment from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-indicted-on-three-counts-of-fraud/">two counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud</a>.</p>
<p>The company continues to pay for his attorney’s fees, which came in at a cost of around $12.6 million for the first nine months of this year. Nikola said that it would seek reimbursement from Milton, “for costs and damages in connection with the government and regulatory investigations.” As of the end of September, he owned around 16% of Nikola stock.</p>
<p>To say that the past financial year has been a struggle for the company would be an understatement. Nikola was flying high last September, when it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/general-motors-takes-2-billion-stake-electric-truck-startup-nikola/">$2 billion strategic partnership</a> with General Motors that included the automaker taking an 11% stake in the then-startup and production terms for Nikola’s fuel cell pickup (that pickup has since been squashed). But just a month later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/nikla-shares-drop-as-gm-pulls-plug-on-investment-deal/">GM backed out of the deal</a>, after the SEC opened the investigation following a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research.</p>
<p>The resolution to pay $125 million to the SEC must first be approved by the regulator, Nikola told investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re fans of the Backbone One iPhone controller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/with-backing-from-mr-beast-and-nadeshot-backbone-one-could-finally-crack-competitive-mobile-gaming/">around here</a>. A lovely mixture of rock-solid hardware and way-better-than-it-should-be software, it has quickly become my favorite way to game on the go. Expand the controller, drop iPhone in, resume zombie killing/guarding the galaxy/etc.</p>
<p>This morning the company is announcing a bunch of new features for that aforementioned software, with one catch: while the companion app/service will continue to be free for existing users, it&#8217;ll cost new users a few bucks a month.</p>
<p>Backbone&#8217;s companion software serves as an all-encompassing hub for the controller. It gives you a quick and pretty way to access all of your Backbone-friendly games, but also gives you cross-game voice chat and parties, a system for grabbing and sharing clips, and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;ll soon learn a few new tricks, as well. The company has a big blog post announcing the new feature set <a href="https://playbackbone.com/blog/announcing-backbone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but if you&#8217;re just looking for the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users will now be able to hardwire the Backbone One to other devices — iPads, Macs and PCs — to control them</li>
<li>Video recording quality has been bumped from 1080p 30 FPS to 1080p 60 FPS for any device running iOS 15</li>
<li>A toggle-able &#8220;Smart Recording&#8221; feature will let you record the last 15 seconds of gameplay, retroactively</li>
<li>Built-in Twitch streaming support, allowing you to broadcast your mobile gaming skillzzz to the world with just a few clicks</li>
<li>On iOS 15, you can configure it so that connecting the Backbone One will automatically put iOS into gaming focus mode, which will silence notifications except for those you&#8217;ve deemed most important</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll now be able to share your screen directly to friends in parties, for when you want to go live but maybe not to everyone on Twitch</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve improved game search, and improved load times and stability overall</li>
</ul>
<p>With these new additions, Backbone will start charging a monthly fee for access to the companion app — but only for new users. If you&#8217;ve already got a Backbone One, access to the app and related service — now dubbed &#8220;Backbone+&#8221; — will remain free for life. If you&#8217;re a new user, you&#8217;ll get one free year of Backbone+ access, after which it&#8217;ll cost about $50 a year. Don&#8217;t want to pay for the companion app? Backbone CEO Maneet Khaira tells me it&#8217;ll continue working just fine as a controller, and you&#8217;ll still be able to update the controller&#8217;s software via the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/975327499681780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Communities Summit</a> today, the social networking giant announced a series of updates and new tools for managing Facebook Groups, including tools designed to help admins better develop the group&#8217;s culture, as well as several other new additions like subgroups and subscription-based paid subgroups, real-time chat for moderators, support for community fundraisers and more.</p>
<p>Among the new features is a suite of tools for Facebook Group admins that will help those who run online communities customize their group in various ways &#8212; from the look-and-feel to greeting messages and more. These features can help to better differentiate one group from another and help to set the tone for the group and its culture, Facebook believes.</p>
<p>With the new tools, admins will be able to change the group&#8217;s colors, post backgrounds and fonts that appear in the group, and the emoji that members use to react to its content. They&#8217;ll also be able to use feature sets to select from preset collections of posts, formats, badges, admin tools and more that they can then enable for their group with a click to customize the group further. Admins could add multiple feature sets designed around what their group is about (e.g. &#8220;parenting&#8221;) or what sort of functionality it may offer (e.g. &#8220;questions and advice,&#8221; &#8220;real-time connections,&#8221; &#8220;learning,&#8221; etc.).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229117" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229126" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229126" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2229126 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png?w=319" alt="" width="319" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png?resize=319,680 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/feature-sets-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another addition will be a new greeting message where admins can share the group rules with new members. Typically, larger groups ask members to agree to a set of rules that some new members simply click &#8220;yes&#8221; to, but never really read. The greeting message could help to address this problem, as it will automatically appear when a member joins the group for the first time, introducing members to the rules and other group norms &#8212; like a suggestion for the members to introduce themselves with a post, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229128" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229128" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229128" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png?w=320" alt="" width="320" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png?resize=320,680 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/new-member-greeting-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229128" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook today also teased an upcoming feature called &#8220;community awards&#8221; that it plans to broadly roll out soon. This will allow admins to encourage and reward members for their positive participation in the group by anointing select posts with accolades like &#8220;Insightful,&#8221; &#8220;Uplifting,&#8221; &#8220;Fun,&#8221; &#8220;Informative&#8221; or &#8220;Relevant,&#8221; for example. (Some groups have already been testing this feature.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of group functionality, admins will now be able to pin announcements to a new Featured section at the top of their groups, and take advantage of an update to the moderation aid, Admin Assist. The tool will now give personalized suggestions of criteria to add and better inform admins when certain content is declined. Admin Assist will roll out to Facebook Lite, Facebook&#8217;s app for emerging markets, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229138" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229138" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?w=319" alt="" width="319" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=768,1637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=319,680 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=721,1536 721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/featured.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another set of newly announced tools are designed to help group members better connect with one another and, in some cases, generate revenue.</p>
<p>This includes the launch of Community Chats, a chat interface in both Facebook and Messenger that allows the admins and the moderation team to talk to each other in real time. The feature could come in handy for larger communities that involve a team of people who all need to be on the same page about community management decisions, including those that have to be made quickly in reaction to content that may need their input, oversight or removal.</p>
<p>Groups will also be able to create recurring events if the group regularly meets virtually or in-person.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229132" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229132" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229132" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png?w=319" alt="" width="319" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png?resize=319,680 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-chats.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229132" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook says it will also begin testing a new &#8220;subgroups&#8221; feature that will allow members to split off for specific topics, regions or occasions. These subgroups can be managed in one place and give people a way to have side discussions without cluttering up the main group&#8217;s feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229135" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229135" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229135" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png?w=319" alt="" width="319" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png?resize=319,680 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/subgroups-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229135" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another interesting aspect to this test is that Facebook will permit groups to create paid subgroups that group members can subscribe to for a fee in order to access exclusive content or experiences. Facebook suggests the feature could be used for things like coaching, networking or other &#8220;deeper conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229141" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229141" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png?w=320" alt="" width="320" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png?resize=320,680 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/paid-subgroups.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>During the tests, admins will receive the earnings from the subscriptions minus the app store fees and applicable taxes, but Facebook says it won&#8217;t take a cut of the revenue at this time. (Of course, that could change in the future.) This differs from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/facebook-apple-subscription-fees-custom-links/">yesterday&#8217;s news</a> that Facebook will offer individual creators a way to offer custom subscription links that route around Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase fees.</p>
<p>Facebook Groups will be able to host community fundraisers as well, to raise money for group projects, to pay hosts for their time managing the group or anything else admins and members want to support financially.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229140" style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229140" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229140" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png?w=319" alt="" width="319" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png?resize=319,680 319w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/community-fundraisers-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229140" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>And groups will be able to sell merchandise through a shop attached to their group, which would be another way for members to support the group. Here, admins can sell products they&#8217;ve specifically created for their group &#8212; like custom tees or bags, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229142" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229142" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png?w=320" alt="" width="320" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png?resize=141,300 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png?resize=320,680 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shops.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229142" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the rollout of all the new tools and features, Facebook says it&#8217;s introducing a new consumer experience that&#8217;s in early testing, but will later become more broadly available. The company didn&#8217;t offer as much detail on this but noted it would allow Groups admins to &#8220;use an official voice&#8221; when interacting with their community (i.e. post as their Page) and would help Page admins &#8220;build communities in a single place&#8221; and give them access to the same moderation tools that Facebook Groups today have access to.</p>
<p>The company said these changes were in anticipation of how groups would play a role in parent company Meta&#8217;s upcoming plans for the &#8220;metaverse&#8221; it&#8217;s building.</p>
<p>In introducing the new features, Meta (Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said &#8220;building community&#8221; is going to be a key part of the metaverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Groups and communities on Facebook are going to be an important part of this vision. Nothing beats being together. But when we can&#8217;t be together in person, the metaverse will help get us even closer to feeling that sense of an in-person connection,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re focused on building bridges from our apps on 2D screens into more immersive virtual experiences. Facebook, and your groups, are going to be central to this. That’s why I’m glad to be here to help kick off this celebration of communities,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin against NASA over the agency’s decision to award a lunar lander contract to Elon Musk’s SpaceX earlier this year.</p>
<p>The dismissal of the complaint brings to a close a months-long saga over the Human Landing System program, a NASA initiative to facilitate the design of a lunar landing system that could return humans to the moon in 2024.</p>
<p>When NASA announced that it had chosen SpaceX &#8212; and only SpaceX &#8212; to develop the lander at a cost of $2.9 billion, Blue Origin began its protest. Blue, along with defense contractor Dynetics, filed a complaint with the government watchdog the Government Accountability Office over the decision, on the grounds that awarding a single company was anti-competitive and that the selection process was biased.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While it’s true that NASA did veer from historical precedent in only selecting one provider for the contract, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">GAO ultimately dismissed the companies’ complaint</a>. The simple fact, according to GAO, was that NASA ended up with less funds than anticipated for the contract; hence, it was only able to give out a single award.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Bezos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/bezos-offers-billions-in-incentives-for-nasas-lunar-lander-contract/">penned an open letter</a> to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, offering to solve the budget issue by knocking $2 billion off the cost to develop a lander and self-funding a pathfinder mission in exchange for a contract.</p>
<p>That approach didn’t work either, so in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">Blue filed its lawsuit</a>. According to its complaint, NASA’s evaluation of proposals under the HLS program was “unlawful and improper.”</p>
<p>Federal judge Richard Hertling’s dismissal of the suit is currently sealed, so the exact reasoning behind the decision isn’t yet clear, but he ordered the parties to prepare proposed redactions near the end of the month so the document could be released to the public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In response to the news, Musk tweeted out a meme from the from the 1995 movie “Judge Dredd”:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="und"><a href="https://t.co/deqktTvS3U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/deqktTvS3U</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The number of DevOps tools has increased exponentially over the last few years and, with that, the amount of data these tools can produce to help businesses improve their software development processes. But most of the time, this data simply ends up in a dashboard for some scattershot analysis. <a href="https://www.propelo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Propelo</a> (previously known as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/levelops-inc-announces-company-name-change-to-propelo-inc-301364953.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LevelOps</a>) wants to bring order to this chaos and aims to build an &#8220;AI-driven engineering excellence platform&#8221; that brings together a set of machine learning-powered analytics services and no-code robotic process automation (RPA) tools to help users turn these data points into something actionable.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $12 million Series A funding round led by Decibel Partners. Fike Ventures, Eniac Ventures and Fathom Capital also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Propelo founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishantdoshi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nishant Doshi</a> previously co-founded SaaS security service CirroSecure, which Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-release-details/2015/Palo-Alto-Networks-Acquires-CirroSecure/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> in 2015. After that, he spent a few years at Palo Alto, where he experienced the explosion of DevOps tools firsthand as a senior director and VP of engineering. To get a better view of the development process, the team had to stitch together data from sources like Jira, GitHub, Salesforce and elsewhere.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229092" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229092" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229092 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/product-screenshot.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2229092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Propelo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very manual, very resource-intensive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not focusing on the core of your businesses but you start hacking together a solution &#8212; and there&#8217;s always one more tool. And even if you get these tools, you don&#8217;t know what to measure. You won&#8217;t have access to the advances that a purpose-built solution like ours brings to the table, and more importantly, you don&#8217;t have actionability.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229107" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229107" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2229107" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="258" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png 1088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?resize=768,661 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?resize=680,585 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/outdo_image_2-648w.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2229107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Propelo</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s this last part, Doshi stressed, that closes the circle. It&#8217;s one thing to have good data and analytical insights, after all, but that&#8217;s not going to help your development processes if there is a disconnect between this information and actually taking actions based on it. Using Propelo&#8217;s RPA tools, users &#8212; and the company notes that it mostly caters to users in the engineering leadership stack &#8212; can easily automate a lot of tasks and workflows to improve DevOps processes within a business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service currently integrates with about <a href="https://www.propelo.ai/product/data-sources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 DevOps tools</a> like Jira, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Gerrit and TestRails. Using its AI smarts, Propelo can then help its users discover hidden bottlenecks or predict when a sprint will likely slip &#8212; which is difficult, because developers have a tendency to never move a task from &#8220;in progress&#8221; to &#8220;done.&#8221; Indeed, data hygiene &#8212; and updating Jira tickets &#8212; isn&#8217;t something most developers really want to think about, so Propelo can regularly nudge them to do so.</p>
<p>Current Propelo users include the likes of Broadcom and CDK Global. &#8220;Propelo provides us the data-driven insights on how to reduce DevOps friction and reduce wasted motions at a very granular per scrum team level. This helps us with maximizing the efficiency of additional engineering investments and removing pain points for engineers,&#8221; said Joe Chen, a VP of Engineering at Broadcom in charge of security technologies and endpoint solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K.’s Labour Party has confirmed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattack/">cyberattack</a> on a third-party company has led to the compromise of members&#8217; data.</p>
<p>In an email sent to all party members and <a href="https://labour.org.uk/about-your-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted to its website</a>, Labour said it was informed of a &#8220;cyber incident” by an unnamed third-party data processor on October 29.</p>
<p>Details remain thin, but Labour said the incident led to “a significant quantity of party data being rendered inaccessible on their systems.” A person responding to the incident told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/labour-party-supporters-details-affected-by-cyber-security-breach-12458935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky News</a> that the incident was a ransomware attack on Labour&#8217;s third-party supplier. Labour has yet to confirm this, and TechCrunch has asked for more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229077" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The scale of the breach is also unclear and it’s not yet known what data has been compromised. Labour, which holds financial information on paying members, said that the affected data “includes information provided to the party by its members, registered and affiliated supporters, and other individuals who have provided their information.”</p>
<p>However, it appears a number of former and non-members were also impacted by the incident. One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/PoppyCocktails/status/1456218546682449924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> they received the data breach notification despite having left the party in 2009, while others <a href="https://twitter.com/buddy_hell/status/1456217907940118529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they also received the email despite having never been a party member. Some say they are affected by the data breach, even though they aren&#8217;t Labour Party members, but paid the political fee as a member of a Labour-affiliated union.</p>
<p>Labour has about 430,000 members. The party&#8217;s statement said its investigation is underway. It&#8217;s also informed the National Crime Agency (NCA), the National Cyber Security Centre, and has informed the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the NCA said: “The NCA is leading the criminal investigation into a cyber incident impacting on the Labour Party. We are working closely with partners to mitigate any potential risk and assess the nature of this incident.” The ICO — <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2020/11/uk-political-parties-must-improve-data-protection-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which recently urged U.K. political parties to improve data protection practices</a> — has also confirmed that it is actively making inquiries into the incident.</p>
<p>The Labour Party said it was also working closely with the unnamed third-party supplier to &#8220;urgently investigate&#8221; the full nature, circumstance and impact of the incident. It stressed that its own data systems were unaffected in the attack.</p>
<p>The incident isn&#8217;t the first time that the Labour Party has been impacted by ransomware. Last year the party alerted members that data stored by company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/blackbaud/">Blackbaud</a> had been compromised in a ransomware attack. At the time, the party said it believed that information about donors over a period of several years had been compromised.</p>
