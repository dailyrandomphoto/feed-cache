					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>The Q2 earnings cycle is powering along, which means that your humble Exchange crew have been on the phone with a number of public-company CEOs working to bring you the trends and notes that matter. To that end, today we’re going to check in on Appian, Paycom and BigCommerce.</p>
<p>After that we’ll peek at fresh material that will bolster our recent dives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">into the BNPL world</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns/">startup competition</a>. So, a grab bag today, and hopefully one full of goodies!</p>
<p>Let’s start with <strong>Appian</strong>. I got to know the company midpandemic when a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/covid-19-is-driving-demand-for-low-code-apps/">host of companies were hammering away</a>, building apps using its low-code tech. At the time Appian was worth about half of what it is today. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.appian.com/index.php/static-files/e2b1dbd4-a4c7-4987-af1d-20b97cef253f">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then the company has continued its cloud push, slowing shedding services revenues in favor of high-margin SaaS incomes. It’s not the only company executing a related transformation. But for our purposes today I want to talk about what comes after the basic low-code work that we spent much of 2020 digging into.</p>
<p>Appian announced that it is buying process mining firm <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lana-labs">Lana Labs</a> in conjunction with its second-quarter earnings. What’s process mining? Thanks for asking. Process mining is a software technique for finding processes inside of companies that <em>can</em> be automated. It’s all well and good to buy an RPA service for your company, but if you don’t know what you can automate, you might not wind up getting full value.</p>
<p>All this matters in the case of Appian as the company now has process mining, RPA and low-code tooling to help companies create applications under a single roof. In practice the parts work together with process mining identifying things to automate, a workflow that is then taken up by RPA and other forms of automation &#8212; AI, human &#8212; to allow companies to better get their operations in efficient order.</p>
<p>I asked Appian CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcalkins/">Matt Calkins</a> about the difference between workflows and apps. He said that they are pretty much the same thing. This makes the low-code world a bit more grokable. How many apps could corporations really need, I’ve always wondered. The same question regarding how many workflows that companies may need to automate feels different. It feels like there’s many, many more possibilities. So, a bigger TAM.</p>
<p>Updating my thinking about low-code, this dynamic makes me more bullish on the software method if it’s more in service of helping companies digitize their operations and automate rote tasks than simply building more apps.</p>
<p>Turning the page to <strong>BigCommerce</strong>, the open-SaaS e-commerce platform has had a good few quarters, posting generally accelerating revenue growth despite Shopify’s rising global profile. It also just marked its first anniversary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/after-shopifys-huge-quarter-bigcommerce-raises-its-ipo-price-range/">since going public</a>, so I spent a few minutes with CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brent-bellm-3b305214/">Brent Bellm</a> to chat about what he’s learned in that year, and if going public was worth it. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.bigcommerce.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bigcommerce-announces-second-quarter-financial-results-0">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It was, he said. He made two cases for taking companies public that I wanted to share. They add up to faster growth at BigCommerce, though Bellm cautioned that it was impossible to disaggregate growth stemming from the following factors from other elements that contributed to his company’s recent performance.</p>
<p>Regardless, a few reasons to go public:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility: </strong>Being a public company with open finances can breed in-market confidence. Startups have an awkward habit of dying somewhat often. Public companies far less so. This means that customers are more likely to trust a company, perhaps boosting its chances of securing deals. Even more, partners are more confident in BigCommerce now that it is public, per Bellm, helping drive more partnerships and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Increased attention:</strong> I thought that I understood this element of going public, but Bellm expanded my perspective. Of <em>course</em> going public is a branding event. But that’s where I thought this particular edge wrapped up. Instead, the CEO explained that now when his company does <em>a thing</em> the analyst community has to pay attention, for example. So it’s easier for BigCommerce to stay in the public eye as a public company than when it was a startup. Call it boosted ambient market noise, in a good sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bellm told The Exchange that going public was “overwhelmingly positive” for his company. Unicorns, take note.</p>
<p>Then there was <strong>Paycom</strong>. This chat was mostly about talent in two ways. First, Paycom is dealing with the same competitive tech talent market as every other company. But notably it’s seeing a tight supply of the talent it needs despite being far from traditional technology hubs. Paycom is based in Oklahoma, notably. (You can read the company’s Q2 report <a href="https://investors.paycom.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Paycom-Software-Inc.-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But the talent market and its general tightness today is impacting Paycom in another way: The HR-tech company sells software that helps companies secure and retain talent. Those businesses, per the company’s CEO Chad Richison, are benefiting from companies’ putting more focus on not letting talent go after they went through all the work of getting them aboard.</p>
<p>Also the labor market has become very similar to the venture capital market, it turns out. Richison said that today you have to make a choice on whether to hire someone after you interview them within a few days. Before you had more time. Just like VCs today are forced to cut checks in days instead of weeks and months.</p>
<p>Hot economy summer, or something.</p>
<h2>The startup BNPL market</h2>
<p>Hope remains for the startup BNPL market, per <a href="https://twitter.com/ozdane">Brad Paterson</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.splitit.com/">Splitit</a>. Splitit allows customers to use their current credit cards to make installment payments. So it’s a mix of traditional credit and BNPL. (SplitIt’s Crunchbase page is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/payitsimple">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Paterson volunteered to provide comment on the current market for BNPL startups, and after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/what-squares-acquisition-of-afterpay-means-for-startups/">chatting much about the Square-Afterpay deal</a>, I wanted to get his take on why smaller companies are going to be able to survive behemoths charging into their market.</p>
<p>In an email, Paterson argued that a wealth of factors, what he described as “average purchase price, length of installment plan, industry vertical serviced, etc.” will protect margins in the space. And that as BNPL solutions can “extend beyond smaller purchases,” there will be room for startups in the space.</p>
<p>Perhaps the better question is how much more work there is to do with consumer credit and checkout. That sounds much more like an infinite problem space than just BNPL tooling itself.</p>
<h2>Startup competition</h2>
<p>Returning to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/do-bronze-medals-ever-make-sense-for-unicorns/">earlier work regarding startup competition</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33">Elizabeth Yin</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/HustleFundVC">Hustle Fund</a> sent in a list of notes that I want to share. When we were discussing the importance of being a leading player in markets for startups, we were mostly discussing the marketplace space, areas where young companies are trying to connect different parties.</p>
<p>In ride-hailing, that’s drivers and riders. Food delivery is even more complex, with delivery drivers, consumers and food-generative business establishments. You get the idea. Per Yin, being content with lower-tier market share is “generally really tough.” She continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The value of a marketplace usually increases as both the supply and demand sides increase. E.g., more listings + customers on Airbnb. More drivers and riders on Uber. Etc. In fact, in many cases, that is the <em>sole</em> value.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re No. 3 or No. 4 in the market, retention is a big potential concern, because you have to ask yourself what will enable you to keep your supply and demand sides from defecting to the No. 1 or No. 2 player that has a larger network? This is why you tend to see consolidation of marketplaces.</p>
<p>For early backers, they may still end up doing fine via an acquisition to No. 1 or No. 2, but it may end up being a magnitude or two off from the outcome of backing the No. 1 or No. 2 marketplace. For this reason, if there are already a couple of marketplaces that have a strong head start, early-stage investors tend to shy away from backing a new player.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yin also answered our question ​​startup marketplace competition generally yielding markets with a small number of leading players, and a dearth of other competitors as smaller entrants are chased out due to low market share. She added an interesting perspective regarding the impact of capital:</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, yes, but investors also play a role in this phenomenon. Once a couple of companies get going, investors tend to pour more into those initial leaders AND others tend to shy away from backing competitors. And once money floods a space, it&#8217;s really customer acquisition costs that become an issue &#8212; CAC gets driven up by the top companies. (We saw this with the rise in food delivery companies). This is why you can&#8217;t really bootstrap a marketplace company very easily &#8212; you can&#8217;t afford to acquire customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, in a sense, an answer to the question about kingmaking in the startup world. VCs are not deciding who wins in many cases, but the impact of capital really can skew results in the marketplace world. Now, let’s stop before we start endorsing how the first Vision Fund disbursed capital! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Hugs, and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The question for the tech news cycle in China these days has become: Who is Beijing&#8217;s next target? Regulatory clampdowns are common in China&#8217;s tech industry but the breadth of the recent moves has been unprecedented. No major tech giant is exempted and everyone is being attacked from a slightly different angle, but Beijing&#8217;s message is clear: Tech businesses are to align themselves with the interests and objectives of Beijing.</p>
<h2>Education curbs hit tech giants</h2>
<p>The government&#8217;s motivation isn&#8217;t always ideological. It could lead to policies that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/31/china-roundup-keep-down-internet-upstarts-cultivate-hard-tech/"> rein in the unruly private tutoring sector</a> in the hope of easing pressure on students and parents. Recent orders from Beijing have strictly limited after-school tutoring, though they also sparked a wave of sympathy for public school teachers who work at lucrative tutoring centers to compensate for their meager salaries.</p>
<p>The effects of the education crackdown are also trickling down to internet companies. For the past few years, ByteDance had been aggressively<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/bytedance-announces-its-first-gadget-in-a-big-education-push/"> building an online education business</a> through a hiring and acquisition spree in part to diversify an ad-based video business. Its plan seems to be in shambles as it reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/bytedance-lay-off-staff-close-businesses-over-china-tutoring-clampdown-sources-2021-08-05/">lay off staff in its education department</a> following recent the clampdown.</p>
<p>The restraints are also hitting American companies. Duolingo, the language learning app, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/china-removes-duolingo-from-app-stores-targeting-u-s-edtech">was removed from several app stores in China</a>. While it&#8217;s not immediately clear whether the action was the result of any policy change, the government recently, along with its restraints on extra-curriculum, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-bars-foreign-curriculum-ownership-some-private-schools-2021-05-17/">barred foreign curricula in schools from K-9</a>.</p>
<h2>Games are opium</h2>
<p>It could be tricky to read the top leaders&#8217; minds because their messages could come through various government departments or state-affiliated media outlets, carrying different weights.</p>
<p>This week, Tencent is in the authorities&#8217; crosshairs. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-falls-after-china-media-calls-online-gaming-spiritual-opium-2021-08-03/">About $60 billion of its market cap</a> was wiped after the Economic Information Daily, an economic paper supervised by China&#8217;s major state news agency Xinhua, published an article (which was taken down shortly) describing video games as &#8220;spiritual opium&#8221; and cited the major role Tencent plays in the industry. Shares of Tencent&#8217;s smaller rival NetEase were also battered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This certainly isn&#8217;t the first time Tencent and the gaming industry overall were slammed by the government for their impact on underage players. Tencent has been working to appease the authorities by introducing protections for young players, for instance, by tightening age checks several times.</p>
<p>Tencent, which has a sprawling online empire of social networks, payments and music on top of games, has also promised to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/tencent-motto-tech-for-good/">&#8220;do [more social] good&#8221; through its products</a>. And following the recent op-ed from the state paper, Tencent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-media-b48e08c16d0c299a970fda6acd7bcc79">further restricted</a> the amount of time and money children can spend inside games. But after all, the company still depends largely on addictive game mechanics that lure players to open loot boxes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186395" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186395" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2186395 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="632" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png 1286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-05-at-2.08.45-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186395" class="wp-caption-text">Tencent share prices over the past six months. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google Finance</p></div></p>
<h2>Fix the algorithms</h2>
<p>The other camp of tech companies feeling the heat is those dependent on machine learning algorithms to distribute content. The Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, the country&#8217;s watchdog of public expressions, along with several other government organs, issued an <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-08/02/c_1127722893.htm">advisory</a> to &#8220;strengthen the study and guidance of online algorithms and carry out oversight over algorithmic recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s goal is to assert more control over how algorithmic black boxes affect what information people receive. Shares of Kuaishou, TikTok&#8217;s archrival in China, tanked on the news. Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/kuaishou-ipo/">blockbuster initial public offering</a> in February, Kuaishou&#8217;s stock price has tumbled<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-rivals-stock-slides-amid-removal-of-u-s-app-criticism-of-video-platforms-11628166283"> as much as 70%</a>. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based short video firm is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/bytedance-rival-kuaishou-shuts-down-controversial-short-video-app-zynn-in-us/">shuttering</a> one of its overseas apps called Zynn, which has caused controversy over plagiarism. But its overseas user base is also rapidly growing, crystalizing in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/tiktoks-chinese-nemesis-kuaishou-hits-1-billion-monthly-users-worldwide/"> one billion monthly users worldwide</a> recently.</p>
<h2>End of &#8220;two-choose-one&#8221;</h2>
<p>The week hasn&#8217;t ended. On Friday morning, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-antitrust-regulator-planning-to-fine-meituan-about-1-billion-11628238951">reported</a> that the country&#8217;s antitrust regulator is preparing to fine Meituan, China&#8217;s major food delivery platform, $1 billion for allegedly abusing its market dominance. In 2020, Meituan <a href="http://meituan.todayir.com/html/index.php">earned 114.8 billion yuan</a> or $17.7 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Until recently, forcing suppliers to pick sides had been a common practice in China&#8217;s e-commerce world. Alibaba did so by forbidding sellers to list on rivaling platforms, a practice that resulted in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/china-gets-serious-about-antitrust-fines-alibaba-2-75b/">$2.75 billion antitrust penalty in April</a>. We will see where the government will act next as it continues to curb the power of its tech darlings.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimrod-golan-yanay-8196a4/">Nimrod Golan-Yanay</a> is the CEO of <a href="https://www.urbanaero.com/">Urban Aeronautics</a>, the Israel-based aerospace company behind the world’s first wingless, eco-friendly and compact aircraft fleet designed specifically for dense urban environments.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nearly everyone knows the pain of sitting in traffic watching valuable minutes tick by. Just as bad is the maddening search for a parking spot, or even just a safe place to hop out of the backseat of an Uber on a dense, buzzing city street.</p>
<p>For emergency medical providers, these headaches can literally mean life or death. Who among us hasn’t stared up at the sky behind a sea of red taillights, wishing we could rise above the gridlock and get to whatever corner of the city in a fraction of the time?</p>
<p>The truth is, flying cars are a reality. The aviation technology exists and early-stage regulatory review is underway in both the <a href="https://evtol.com/news/legislation-secure-leadership-advanced-air-mobility-introduced-us-congress/">U.S. House and the Senate</a> to bring eVTOLs — electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles — to market.</p>
<p>What doesn’t exist is a place to land them. The promise of urban air mobility is the promise of superlative convenience — a trip to the airport that would regularly take 90 minutes door-to-door whittled down to 10. For this promise to be realized, eVTOL landing points must be as accessible as taxi lines — think a five-minute walk (or one-minute elevator ride) from your office.</p>
<p>And sure, we’ve seen office buildings and hospitals on the outer edges of cities build heliports on their roofs. But the truth is, helicopters’ external rotors make them too noisy and too dangerous to land in tight spaces. Heliports have to be on the outer borders of cities — they need the extra space for safety (and noise) concerns.</p>
<h2>Urban flight today</h2>
<p>I have over 25 years of experience as a helicopter pilot. I know that urban air travel is nothing new. However, noise ordinances, space constraints and safety measures needed to make commercial helicopter flights viable have largely limited their use.</p>
<p>Existing VTOLs are much better designed for repeated commercial use, but they still don’t solve for noise. Most importantly, they do not eliminate the risks associated with external moving mechanical components and large wingspans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Instead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These VTOLs also require far more space for takeoff and landing — which means intracity travel won&#8217;t be feasible without massive infrastructure investments, a fact pointed out by countless urban air mobility analysts and even folks at NASA. For it to work, cities would have to turn a huge percentage of their rooftops into miniairports, which would require years of disruption.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R4GJUiHn9R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/">The air taxi market prepares to take flight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The air taxi market prepares to take flight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-air-taxi-market-prepares-to-take-flight/embed/#?secret=R4GJUiHn9R" data-secret="R4GJUiHn9R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That isn’t the only option, though. Engineers are developing compact VTOLs with the agility of a helicopter and the size and relative safety (and interior machinery) of a car. These vehicles have the best chance to prove the viability of VTOLs. Imagine an ambulance arriving at the scene of an accident via air — landing in a parking-spot-sized space directly next to the accident — and swiftly moving the injured to a hospital in another part of the city.</p>
<p>Instead of looking to airports as the model for advanced air mobility, we should look to metro hubs that are accessible to everyone, with multiple departures and arrivals per day. However, this kind of passenger turnover only works at scale if there are numerous eVTOLs coming and going — just like a train station. This just isn’t feasible unless most of those eVTOLS are smaller than a passenger van.</p>
<h2>Consider the ground, not just the skyline</h2>
<p>Decades from now, city infrastructure will look very different. Vertiports within the city that can accommodate VTOLs of all sizes and distance capabilities will be commonplace in the modern metropolis. But these train stations for the sky require enormous vision and forward thinking on the part of city planners, civil engineers, policymakers and politicians, as well as citizens demanding alternative forms of transportation.</p>
<p>Current prototypes require dramatic resurfacing of the city’s skyline for safe takeoff and landing at scale, but it does not have to be this way. The street infrastructure required to bring VTOLs to city dwellers is too often overlooked.</p>
<p>Cities need to consider the spaces and cases for VTOLs. We need to think about the city as we know it now — how can we design a vehicle that fits naturally within the environment that already exists? Is there space to create a vehicle that coexists with the city’s people as well as its birds? One quiet enough that anyone would welcome on their apartment rooftop?</p>
<h2>Big vision, small footprint</h2>
<p>A smaller eVTOL isn’t just more agile and safer in dense spaces, it also allows for more vehicles per square foot, more flights per hour, and more people moved across town per day in a more affordable way.</p>
<p>Before we can build the vertiport of the future, we must first use what already exists today to prove the case for urban air mobility. We need to be deliberate in matching the technology to the infrastructure that city dwellers know and expect, not vice versa. This means an eco-friendly VTOL that can land not just on helipads, piers and parking lots, but literally anywhere an SUV might fit.</p>
<p>Size alone is not enough. We must think about alternative fuel sources. Batteries are one, but they’re also inefficient, and the ecological impact of battery production, storage and disposal make them far from perfect. Some VTOL developers have proposed hydrogen as a fuel source; I welcome this and encourage more investment toward innovation in hydrogen-powered aviation. The larger commercial aviation market is already taking big steps toward hydrogen-fueled airliners, and VTOL developers have no excuse not to do the same.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to start with a truly efficient VTOL that can have the biggest impact in the shortest time frame, and where time is of the essence: Emergency services. The promise of flying cars to improve people’s lives must be made apparent and available in the most essential of use cases first.</p>
<p>This will not only make an immediate, positive impact, it will also help pave the way for acceptance, infrastructure and large-scale commercialization for VTOLs of every size and use case. Indeed, it will realize the dream of the flying car.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XixQLSFgU6Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Writing our way out of the place we&#8217;re in is tricky. The words come easily enough, each measured for its emotional weight in the stream of issues we face. It&#8217;s possible this paragraph will disappear as I find my ground. Mandates, Cuomo, Olympic mental gymnastics, where we were two weeks ago and how it relates to right now. Let&#8217;s triangulate: forget Trump. Forget the Republicans and progressive Democrats who together slow down passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Forget the evasions and half truths, the talking points to fill up the airtime until the actual rubber meets the road.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the brave athletes who dare to fail for the greater safety of their colleagues. Celebrate the public servants and the difficult personal choices that lead us to honesty, empathy, resolute choices that will draw distinctions between malignant fraud and real outcomes at the ballot box. If politicians refuse to answer questions, draft laws to weed them out of the process itself. Hold the media to the fire they pretend to examine in their choices of coverage, debate, and commercial breaks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been having an argument about the time delay between recording a show and releasing it here on Techcrunch in a post-produced fashion with music added, Sneak Peeks produced to promote the show, and a post somehow related to the context of the show two or so weeks ago. In generating the text, I&#8217;ve noticed the time delay serves a useful purpose of diluting the realtime urgency of the conversation with what ends up being a healthy dose of context derived from what actually happened. The news is always rendered as the first draft of history, but the constant need for ratings creates this underlying pressure to convert stories from insight to controversial clickbait.</p>
<p>Marshalled through this take-the-foot-off-the-gas filter, the black and white becomes more shades of gray, less subject to the attitudes of the individual Gang members and more attuned to the sense of the group as a whole. Take the perennial struggle between social media giants and antitrust pressure to regulate the worst aspects of the social storm. One side decries attempts to rein in the success of these companies in building audiences and unparalleled power in the marketplace — a version of &#8220;If it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221; The other side says it is indeed broke, and needs to be fixed by breaking up these new monopolies born of user satisfaction with the stream of commentary, sarcasm, and family news. Or perhaps the battle lines are drawn around individual rights versus the collective good, as with the struggle to get COVID under control via vaccination mandates. In the middle between these hard-coded partisan stances is potentially something gentler than being right and more powerful in its sense of compromise.</p>
<p>In the case of mandates, the subject comes up every show. The immediate news may be New York City&#8217;s new rules governing vaccinated access to indoor restaurants, gyms, and entertainment events, but the larger abstraction is the divide between the federal government&#8217;s lack of power to effect a countrywide mandate and the politics of governors in the Red states pushing back on any mandates, most egregiously outlawing local governments from protecting their citizens from the impact of the unvaccinated. Two weeks ago, nothing seemed possible to alleviate any aspect of the crisis. Today, the New York move may encourage more people to act now to protect themselves; the data shows a doubling of new vaccinations in the most impacted states. In turn, the media includes this promising data in their stories, pushing the more partisan memes to the edges of the coverage. The net result is a more flexible narrative that speaks to the old fashioned idea that government can actually get some things done, which in turn helps promote less of the distrust that fuels many of the vaccine hesitant.</p>
<p>Getting back to the new normal drives most of the mandate discussion. The pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of digital transformation seems to reflect a growing understanding that we&#8217;re not going back to post pandemic anytime soon. Instead, there&#8217;s the realization that what we&#8217;re thinking of as survival is a foreshadowing of how we&#8217;ll live both at work and at home. We talk about our creative heroes on the show, many of whom became household names streaming through the stages of public performance and media networks. Streaming has roiled both Hollywood and the news networks, whose business models and value propositions are under attack from the tech social networks. Facebook talks of video now consuming more than 50 percent of time on its network. Amazon&#8217;s advertising revenue is growing rapidly as a counter to Google and Facebook&#8217;s control of the advertising markets. Digital advertising is consuming the linear broadcast Upfronts marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talk often about the creator economy, a self-important waving of the media red flag in the face of the mainstream media&#8217;s bull. The Information, a subscription-fueled tech journal, looks like what the newsletter startups Substack and Twitter Revue will look like when or if they grow up. The social audio Clubhouse clones offer a similar promise of escaping the long tail into viable competition for the Fox, CNN, and MSNBCs of the realigning media companies. On each end of the spectrum, the promise of success runs into the overblown reality of too many hours in search of useful differentiation or unrealistic odds of escaping the noisy underbelly of unprofessional media.</p>
<p>If the numbers don&#8217;t seem to add up for the creators, neither do they for the social networks. Once the feature wars settle down, you&#8217;ll see a fragmented array of star writers on Substack and Facebook and very little outlet for influencers and talent to bubble up. Corporate adoption of these tools might prove a growth opportunity for enterprise versions. Is that enough to keep tech in the game? Maybe two weeks from now we&#8217;ll know.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 6, 2021. We made it to Friday. High-fives all around. If you own stocks or cryptos, you are wrapping up the week on a high. Crypto prices are rising while some indices are hitting records.</p>
<p>Before we get into the news, don’t forget that TechCrunch is launching another newsletter! The first edition of This Week in Apps by our own Sarah Perez launches Saturday morning and is the place to go for all of your app news goodness. Be sure to sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/spacex-stacks-the-full-starship-launch-system-for-the-first-time-standing-nearly-400-feet-tall/">SpaceX builds 400-foot rocket:</a> </strong>If you were concerned that childish jokes regarding billionaire rocketry were about to die down, fear not: SpaceX has stacked its Starship vehicle on top of a Super Heavy booster. That means a very tall rocket with much oomph. This is the first time that Starship and Super Heavy have come together.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/"><strong>The changing value of insurtech startups:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A few weeks back, TechCrunch asked if the market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">should be concerned</a> about insurtech valuations. Then they took another hit. We tackled the topic in the wake of Hippo’s public listing, deciding that most public insurtech companies are wealthy enough in cash terms to not sweat the declines. Too much.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/what-to-expect-from-samsungs-next-unpacked/">What to expect from Samsung’s next hardware event:</a></strong> Samsung’s impending Unpacked event may be, well, packed. We could see a new Galaxy Fold phone, new watches, wearables from a Google partnership and more. TechCrunch will be covering the event this August 11, so stick close to the site for more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/zeroheight-raises-10m-round-led-by-tribe-capital-to-scale-designops-for-ux-teams/"><strong>DesignOps is the new DevOps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our take on zeroheight and its new $10 million Series A round. The startup “does for UX what DevOps platforms like GitHub do for building and shipping code, providing a central place to document and manage UX components,” CEO Jerome de Lafargue told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/raise-a-startup-building-africas-carta-gets-backing-from-500-startups/"><strong>500 Startups backs the Carta for Africa:</strong></a> Carta is an important part of the U.S. startup technology stack, helping keep cap tables and shares in proper order. As Africa’s startup scene expands, it will need something similar. And Raise is building it. Per the startup, most startup equity on the continent is still tracked with paper. It’s time for that to change.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/verifiable-secures-17m-for-its-api-that-manages-healthcare-provider-information/"><strong>Healthcare provider API raises $17M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>APIs to help companies manage their providers are not new. AgentSync is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/13/should-there-be-some-law-against-raising-three-times-in-one-year/">building something in the space for insurance brokers</a>. Verifiable is pursuing a similar model, but focused on healthcare workers. As with Rapid, what is being replaced are manual processes. Software is good at many things, but alleviating humans from certain types of bullshit work is one of them.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/the-first-zambian-startup-to-get-into-yc-is-developing-africas-first-card-issuing-api/"><strong>Card-issuing APIs are coming to Africa:</strong></a> Thanks to the first Zambian company to get into Y Combinator, I hasten to add. The startup in question, Union54, was first launched in 2015 as Zazu, a neobank. But it found the card-issuing space so punitive to work with that it took on that problem, rebranding along the way. Card issuing is a big market in the U.S. and Latin America. Let’s see how it performs in the startup space on a new continent.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage today, TechCrunch has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/dutch-startup-hub-utrecht-emerges-from-amsterdams-shadow/">good and long look at the burgeoning startup hub of Utrecht</a>, that bit of the Netherlands that always looks super gorgeous when you see a photo of it. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Craft your pitch deck around ‘that one thing that can really hook an investor’</h2>
<p>We frequently run articles with advice for founders who are working on pitch decks. It&#8217;s a fundamental step in every startup&#8217;s journey, and there are myriad ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>Michelle Davey of telehealth staffing and services company Wheel and Jordan Nof of Tusk Venture Partners appeared on Extra Crunch Live recently to analyze Wheel&#8217;s Series A pitch.</p>
<p>Nof said entrepreneurs should candidly explain to potential investors what they&#8217;ll need to believe to back their startup.</p>
<p>&#8221; … It takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for the investor and it reorients them to focus on the right problem set that you’re solving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get this one shot to kind of influence what they think they need to believe to get an investment here … if you don’t do that … we could get pretty off base.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“The growth industry is definitely maturing. Less hacks, more teams, more focus on velocity,” Ward van Gasteren, founder of Grow with Ward told us in an interview this week. “Everybody within the field is getting to know the best practices very quickly and implementing them even quicker.

<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/demand-curve-tested-tactics-for-growing-newsletters/">Demand Curve: Tested tactics for growing newsletters:</a></strong> Stewart Hillhouse, senior content lead at Demand Curve, talks through tactics for email newsletters. Hillhouse tells us that newsletters have nearly 40x ROI, but you have to work in order to achieve that. This article discusses the 60% rule for pop-ups, the strategy behind email timing and the importance of quality over quantity. Hillhouse mentions, “We’ve seen very little correlation between volume of emails and the resulting conversion rate.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/demand-curve-questions-you-need-to-answer-in-your-paid-search-ads/">(Extra Crunch) Demand Curve: Questions you need to answer in your paid search ads:</a></strong> Hillhouse also wrote an Extra Crunch article this week about the 14 questions you should be answering with your paid search ads. One question he mentions revolves around acceptance and how “Going shopping in real life is a social activity. Shoppers will peer into the carts of others, compare their tastes and ask those with them for input.” Let’s be honest — we’ve all done it. Hillhouse answers how this behavior can be replicated for online shopping.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/how-to-hire-and-structure-a-growth-team/">(Extra Crunch) How to hire and structure a growth team:</a></strong> Sam Richard, senior director of growth at OpenView, provides insights on what questions you should be asking when you&#8217;re hiring a growth leader. Richard says, &#8220;A strong growth-minded hire will already have a feel for benchmarks and should be able to identify which growth lever in your customer journey needs the most help.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/which-person-should-you-hire-a-growth-hacker-or-a-digital-marketer/">How Ward van Gasteren thinks about growth hacking today:</a></strong> In this interview, Ward van Gasteren spoke about common misconceptions regarding growth hacking, like how it’s assumed to be a perfect approach. But, we were told, “The hard data that you see in your analytics tools can only tell you what is slowing down your growth … not why your growth slows down there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Assembling a startup team is harder than assembling 10 IKEA dressers, and the stakes are much, much higher.</p>
<p>Starting with the assumption that 90% of startups will fail and the most successful ones take an average of six years to IPO, founders must make careful decisions about whom they invite to join the core team.</p>
<p>Will that stellar engineer become a great CTO? Should your product person be opinionated or a team player? Are you even the best choice for CEO?</p>
<p>ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair shared some of his thoughts about building a sturdy leadership team and drafted a thorough checklist for entrepreneurs who are putting a crew together. His initial advice?</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors love founder-CEOs, and founders are often fantastic candidates for this role. But not everyone can do it well, and more importantly, not everyone wants to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a related article, Gregg Adkin, VP and managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, shared<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/whats-the-boards-role-in-an-early-stage-startup/"> the framework he&#8217;s developed for helping founders set up their board</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the right mix of people can impact everything from fundraising to hiring: “Investors often ask founders about their board [because] it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged,” he writes.</p>

<p>Miranda Halpern spoke to Amsterdam-based coach Ward van Gasteren for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/which-person-should-you-hire-a-growth-hacker-or-a-digital-marketer/"> our latest growth marketing interview</a>, which is free to read.</p>
<p>In their discussion, van Gasteren addressed misconceptions about growth hacking, the mistakes most startups are likely to make, and the distinctions he draws between growth hacking and growth marketing:</p>
<p>“Growth hacking is great to kickstart growth, test new opportunities and see what tactics work,” he tells us.</p>
<p>“Marketers should be there to continue where the growth hackers left off: Build out those strategies, maintain customer engagement, and keep tactics fresh and relevant.”</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week; I hope you have a great weekend.</p>

<p>In his first column since returning to TechCrunch, reporter Ryan Lawler considered the potential ripples Square&#8217;s purchase of Afterpay may send across the pond of buy now, pay later startups.</p>
<p>For commentary and perspective, he interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Rosen, founder and general partner, Commerce Ventures</li>
<li>Jake Gibson, founding partner, Better Tomorrow Ventures</li>
<li>TX Zhuo, partner, Fika Ventures</li>
<li>Matthew Harris, partner, Bain Capital Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>The investors he spoke to agreed that deferring payments helps drive e-commerce, &#8220;but scale matters and long-term margins look slim for BNPL startups,&#8221; reports Ryan.</p>

<p>Over the next 18 months, one technologist says the increased adoption of embodied artificial intelligence will open a path to superintelligence — incredibly powerful software that dwarfs anything the human mind could produce.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the crazy Boston Dynamics videos of robots jumping, dancing, balancing and running are examples of embodied AI,&#8221; says Chris Nicholson, founder and CEO of Pathmind, which uses deep reinforcement learning to optimize industrial operations and supply chains.</p>
<p>“The field is moving fast and, in this revolution, you can dance.”</p>

<p>The Exchange looks at the valuations of public insurtech companies and considers what that means for startups &#8212; but from a slightly different perspective.</p>
<p>“We’d typically riff on the new values of public neoinsurance companies and use that data to work our way into a guess concerning what the price declines might mean for related startups,” Alex Wilhelm writes. “Taking public-market data and using it to better understand private markets is pretty much the national pastime of this column.</p>
<p>“Not today.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm checks in on results from Starling Bank and Monzo to see what the neobanks’ most recent financial figures say about the state of neobanks overall.</p>
<p>“Although some neobanks are managing to clean up their ledgers and work toward profits — or reach profitability — not all are in the black,” he notes.</p>
<p>But among those that are?</p>
<p>“At least a portion of the neobanking world is financially stable enough to consider public offerings.”</p>

<p>The red-hot venture capital market may give founders lots of investors to choose from, but the most important thing (if you can be choosy) is being able to trust and rely on your investors, Ripple Ventures’ Matt Cohen and True’s Tony Conrad write in a guest column.</p>
<p>“This &#8230; new dynamic is forcing founders to be extremely selective about exactly who is sitting around their mentorship table,” they write.</p>
<p>“It’s simply not possible to have numerous deep and meaningful relationships to extract maximum value at the early stage from seasoned investors.”</p>

<p>Assembling a board of directors is not merely about finding individuals who can aid your early-stage journey, Gregg Adkin, the vice president and managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>The composition of the board can also impact your fundraising.</p>
<p>“Investors often ask founders about their board [because] it says a lot about their character, their judgment and their willingness to be challenged,” he writes.</p>
<p>Adkins offers a framework he calls “SPIFS” &#8212; for strategy, people, image, finance and systems for compliance &#8212; to aid founders in setting up a board.</p>

<p>“Is this the common reality for startups battling for market position, no matter if those markets are cities or countries?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biden’s major bipartisan infrastructure plan struck a rare chord of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, but changes it proposes to cryptocurrency regulation are tripping up the bill.</p>
<p>The administration intends to pay for $28 billion of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/dealbook/infrastructure-bill-details.html">planned infrastructure spending</a> by tightening tax compliance within the historically under-regulated arena of digital currency. That&#8217;s why cryptocurrency is popping up in a bill that’s mostly about rebuilding bridges and roads.</p>
<p>The legislation&#8217;s vocal critics argue that the bill’s effort to do so is slapdash, particularly a bit that would declare anyone “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” to be a broker, subject to tax reporting requirements.</p>
<p>While that definition might be more straightforward in a traditional corner of finance, it could force cryptocurrency developers, companies and even anyone mining digital currencies to somehow collect and report information on users, something that by design isn’t even possible in a decentralized financial system.</p>
<p>Now, a new amendment to the critical spending package is<a href="https://twitter.com/SenToomey/status/1423731811096670215"> threatening to make matters even worse</a>.</p>
<h2>Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>In a joint letter about the bill&#8217;s text, Square, Coinbase, Ribbit Capital and other stakeholders warned of “financial surveillance” and unintended impacts for cryptocurrency miners and developers. The <a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1422337127556157444">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/stop-the-senate-from-sneaking-through-total-surveillance-of-the-crypto-economy/">Fight for the Future</a>, two privacy-minded digital rights organizations, also slammed the bill.</p>

<p>Following the outcry from the cryptocurrency community, a pair of influential senators proposed an amendment to clarify the new reporting rules. Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) pushed back against the bill, proposing an amendment with fellow finance committee member Pat Toomey (R-PA) that would modify the bill’s language.</p>
<p>The amendment would establish that the new reporting &#8220;does not apply to individuals developing block chain technology and wallets,&#8221; removing some of the bill&#8217;s ambiguity on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;By clarifying the definition of broker, our amendment will ensure non-financial intermediaries like miners, network validators, and other service providers — many of whom don’t even have the personal-identifying information needed to file a 1099 with the IRS — are not subject to the reporting requirements specified in the bipartisan infrastructure package,&#8221; Toomey said.</p>
<p>Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also threw her support behind the Toomey and Wyden amendment, as did Colorado Governor Jared Polis.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Picking winners and losers&#8221;</h2>
<p>The drama doesn&#8217;t stop there. With negotiations around the bill ongoing — the text could be finalized over the weekend — a pair of senators proposed a competing amendment that isn’t winning any fans in the crypto community.</p>
<p>That amendment, from Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Mark Warner (D-VA), would exempt traditional cryptocurrency miners who participate in energy-intensive “proof of work&#8221; systems from new financial reporting requirements, while keeping those rules in place for those using a <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1423113906529177601">&#8220;proof of stake&#8221; system</a>. Portman worked with the Treasury Department to author the cryptocurrency portion of the original infrastructure bill.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow. Sen. Warner and Portman are proposing a last minute amendment competing with the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment. It is a disastrous. It only excludes proof-of-work mining. And it does nothing for software devs. Ridiculous!</p>
<p>Here is all it excludes: <a href="https://t.co/FA7K6NU2s0">pic.twitter.com/FA7K6NU2s0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jerry Brito (@jerrybrito) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Rather than requiring an investment in computing hardware (and energy bills) capable of solving increasingly complex math problems, proof of stake systems rely on participants taking a financial stake in a given project, locking away some of the cryptocurrency to generate new coins.</p>
<p>Proof of stake is emerging as an attractive, climate-friendlier alternative that could reduce the need for heavy computing and huge amounts of energy required for proof of work mining. That makes it all the more puzzling that the latest amendment would specifically let proof of work mining off the hook.</p>
<p>Some popular digital currencies like Cardano are already built on proof of stake. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030"> in the process of migrating</a> from a proof of work system to proof of stake to help scale its system and reduce fees. Bitcoin is the most notable digital currency that relies on proof of work.</p>
<p>The Warner-Portman amendment is being touted as a “compromise” but it’s not really halfway between the Wyden-Toomey amendment and the existing bill — it just introduces new problems that many crypto advocates view as a fresh existential threat to their work.</p>
<p>Prominent members of the crypto community, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1422667000950706187">Square founder and Bitcoin booster Jack Dorsey</a>, have thrown their support behind the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment while slamming the second proposal as misguided and damaging.</p>
<p>The executive director of Coincenter, a crypto think tank, called the Warner-Portman amendment &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577">disastrous</a>.&#8221; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed that language. &#8220;At the 11th hour @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto,&#8221; he tweeted. &#8220;&#8230; We could find ourselves with the Senate deciding which types of crypto will survive government regulation.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA['If you take the leap that the pandemic happened because there's just a lot of things happening in the environment, it means we have to build the future that we want.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andy Yang joined Indiegogo at a turbulent time. As the crowdfunding platform’s then-CEO stepped aside for personal reasons, the service also reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635644/indiegogo-layoffs-ceo-david-mandelbrot-andy-yang">grappled with layoffs</a>. Coming on board after a stretch with Reddit, the new CEO would have less than a year at the helm before COVID-19 turned the globe upside down.</p>
<p>Now 13 years old, the San Francisco-based site matured alongside the world of online crowdfunding. And, certainly, Indiegogo had a front-row seat for all of the ups and downs. Indiegogo introduced several million-dollar campaigns, but the platform has often suffered from comparisons to Kickstarter, a service that has become synonymous with the category for many.</p>
<p>Yang sat down to discuss how Indiegogo has changed under his tenure, how crowdfunding has evolved and what both will look like in a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>What was your primary objective coming on as CEO?</strong></p>
<p>I was at Reddit doing core product, and when Indiegogo’s board and founders reached out, it was really around, “Hey, we would love somebody with product experience, a background in community.” What was going on in Indiegogo was really an evaluation of, “What&#8217;s our core values?” When I took the saddle and the reigns, it was really focusing on that core of who we are, what segments do we want to go after, and where do we want to focus. Where do we want to focus our product?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We’ve had our number of failures on our site, of campaigns that haven&#8217;t fulfilled or just, the campaigns have ghosted their backers, and we own up to that.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>From that perspective, we&#8217;ve been really heads-down for the last two years, just working on ourselves, internally, and focusing on the core &#8212; what we&#8217;re terming “bringing the crowd back in crowdfunding.” I think a lot of the platforms have been very transactional in nature, and so I think backers and consumers and users have been trained by Amazon to click a button and get things two hours later. The premise of crowdfunding is very different.</p>
<p>You may or may not get this perk delivered in the time frame that you&#8217;re expecting, and to help educate backers and the community around that is really core to who we are. We&#8217;ve been through the last two years with COVID, but we&#8217;ve been profitable since I&#8217;ve joined, which is huge. We can control our own destiny and really take the time to do things right and invest in areas like trust and safety, like community, that we really wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>The company wasn’t profitable when you joined?</strong></p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t profitable. I enjoyed and then we cut to profitability, or at least kind of a neutral state, and with any kind of change in leadership, some tenured folks opted out, and we basically became a new team overnight to kind of re-found the company, and we&#8217;ve been slowly adding people over the last couple years, but always with that eye on profitability and controlling our own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond people changing roles, what had to happen in order for the company to become profitable?</strong></p>
<p>Really doubling down on making sure that we understood our sales pipeline and making sure that, from a supply perspective, that we had a number of campaigns from across a number of categories. Obviously, our bread and butter is what we call tech and innovation, consumer electronics hardware, but also seeing what other categories that we can lean into. We&#8217;re definitely strong in comics, travel, outdoors, and what can we do from expanding our wedge and our categories in different areas that we&#8217;re seeing growth. I think a trend that we&#8217;re currently seeing is a lot of green tech. Just trying to understand what categories are growing, where our brand resonates with entrepreneurs and backers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what needed to happen &#8212; just making sure that we had adequate supply on the platform, and also just from the backer side, we had not traditionally focused on the backer side. We had heavily focused on the supply side, but really starting to, again, return back to the crowd in crowdfunding, leaning on my Reddit experience, just making sure that we can engage the community in new and interesting ways.</p>

					<description><![CDATA['What we find is the backers have a deep desire and an interest to be a part of what's happening on the journey. To feel deeply connected is part of what you get as a backer of a creative project.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kickstarter announced on Wednesday that backers have pledged <a href="https://twitter.com/kickstarter/status/1422942324049555460">$6 billion</a> to more than 200,000 projects over the course of the crowdfunding site’s history. The milestone comes a little over a year after the platform hit the $5 billion mark.</p>
<p>A matter of weeks before the company hit that last massive round number, however, it revealed starker news. Kickstarter reduced its staff by 39%, through a combination of layoffs and buyouts, as newly minted CEO Aziz Hasan <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257585/kickstarter-layoffs-employees-union-negotiations-severance">noted a 35% drop in new projects.</a> The company wasn’t alone, certainly, in suffering major setbacks in the face of a pandemic, but that likely didn’t cushion the blow of a downturn with “no clear sign of rebound,” according to the executive.</p>
<p>With another $1 billion pledge in the intervening 15 months, however, it’s probably safe to say that predictions of crowdfunding’s demise were somewhat premature. Like most of the rest of us, the pandemic has spurred a reprioritization and recentering, and the service that has long been synonymous with the category looked to new methods of engagement.</p>
<p>After a dozen years of being the face of crowdfunding, plenty of question marks still remain. The past decade has seen something of a hype bubble for the process, and for some, the shine has worn off a bit, courtesy of undelivered gifts and unfinished campaigns. What will the next decade hold for crowdfunding&#8217;s biggest name? And will the pandemic fundamentally transform how people back projects on the internet?</p>
<p>We sat down with Hasan to discuss the past year, the company&#8217;s big milestone and the future of crowdfunding.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>When you took the role of CEO in 2019, what changes did you feel like you needed to implement?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to touch on the connection that I&#8217;ve always felt with Kickstarter. It, for me personally, is a place where I feel like both my personal passion and what we do on a day-to-day basis came together really well. At one of the first all-hands when I got hired, I said what&#8217;s beautiful about the job that I get to do is that every evening I go home and <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/aziz-hasan-on-finding-harmony-in-your-daily-life-and-creative-work/">I illustrate</a>. And so I get to feel the hard pain, a lot of the insecurity and the uncertainty that comes with being a creator.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;I see crowdfunding as probably one of the best mechanisms to go independently and create the thing that you want and to find the support that you need and the resources that you need.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I come in every morning and I say, &#8220;OK, how am I going to fix that? What can I do to make that process better, make that easier?&#8221; And so that for me was just this underlying motivation. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning. The thought to me was, “What are the ways in which we have the greatest strength in helping creators find the funding that they need?”</p>
<p>I think one of the greatest opportunities that I really see is that the backers are such an incredible part of this puzzle, and for us, for the longest time we really focused on the creator tools and really making sure that the creators have a way to share their project. What we&#8217;ve seen is that backers are such a tremendous part of this process and their ability to discover the joy, the fun, the curiosity that they feel through that process is such an important part of the experience as well. And so here&#8217;s a place where we can actually put some focus and some time and attention on what the backer experience looks like. And so that really has been a big mantra for me as we&#8217;ve been moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to impact the backer experience? In the past two years, how has the backer experience changed?</strong></p>
<p>One is just making it simpler and easier for backers to find projects that they would care about. And I think us being just a space where this stuff exists, I think just putting it out there as it is on a home page or through the creator that you know isn&#8217;t enough. And so there are a lot of channels that we&#8217;ve been using, particularly thinking about our emails and newsletters and these points of connection that we have with the backer over the course of their journey and actually introducing projects that they might like through that process. So we have a recommendation engine that we&#8217;ve been developing over the last few years that&#8217;s meant to help connect, make better connections based on either affinity, which you might like, or the way that you backed in the past or projects that you might&#8217;ve watched.</p>
<p><strong>Early last year, Kickstarter went through a fairly large round of layoffs — 40%, according to reports. How did the company navigate the earliest days of the pandemic and what do you feel you’ve done to help right that ship?</strong></p>
<p>What we saw in our platform was that creators just kind of off the bat had the same level of uncertainty everybody else was feeling. We saw a slowdown of projects and what we saw was about 40% of our pledge volume dipping. And as a result, there&#8217;s a lot of projects that fell off as a result of that. There were some very, very concerning times. The big thing that we thought about was, we need to make sure that our business is resilient for the future, make sure that we&#8217;re actually just set up operationally in a way that we can withstand uncertainty as it comes. Through that really tough time and then, kind of peeking out toward the end of 2020, the backers didn&#8217;t change their pattern of behavior. Even though creators were launching fewer projects during that really difficult time, what we saw was that the backers remained extremely eager to keep pushing forward and supporting creative work.</p>
<p>So things like our pledge rates and success rates remained quite high and that&#8217;s especially if you think about the games community, comics, publishing a number of these spaces where we&#8217;ve always seen strong engagement. That engagement actually continued through. About four or five months after that initial dip, we slowly started to see some of the creators come back online, because I think they also started to recognize that the backers are there. They haven&#8217;t changed their backing patterns. And so what that did for us is that started to give us a bit of understanding here that we should start to connect back to the creators and let them know that the backers are here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It sounds like a plan concocted by a supervillain, if that villain&#8217;s dastardly end was to provide cheap, clean power all over the world: launch a set of three-kilometer-wide solar arrays that beam the sun&#8217;s energy to the surface of the Earth. Even the price tag seems gleaned from pop fiction: one hundred million dollars. But this is a real project at Caltech, funded for a nearly a decade largely by a single donor.</p>
<p>The Space-based Solar Power Project has been underway since at least 2013, when the first donation from Donald and Brigitte Bren came through. Donald Bren is the chairman of Irvine Company and on the Caltech board of trustees, and after hearing about the idea of space-based solar in Popular Science, he proposed to fund a research project at the university — and since then has given more than $100 million for the purpose. The source of the funds has been kept anonymous until this week, <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-announces-breakthrough-100-million-gift-to-fund-space-based-solar-power-project">when Caltech made it public</a>.</p>
<p>The idea emerges naturally from the current limitations of renewable energy. Solar power is ubiquitous on the surface, but of course highly dependent on the weather, season and time of day. No solar panel, even in ideal circumstances, can work at full capacity all the time, and so the problem becomes one of transferring and storing energy in a smart grid. No solar panel <em>on Earth</em>, that is.</p>
<p>A solar panel in orbit, however, may be exposed to the full light of the sun nearly all the time, and with none of the reduction in its power that comes from that light passing through the planet&#8217;s protective atmosphere and magnetosphere.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ambitious project is a transformative approach to large-scale solar energy harvesting for the Earth that overcomes this intermittency and the need for energy storage,&#8221; said SSPP researcher Harry Atwater in the Caltech release.</p>
<p>Of course, you would need to collect enough energy that it&#8217;s worth doing in the first place, and you need a way to beam that energy down to the surface in a way that doesn&#8217;t lose most of it to the aforementioned protective layers but also doesn&#8217;t fry anything passing through its path.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These fundamental questions have been looked at systematically for the last decade, and the team is clear that without Bren&#8217;s support, this project wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Attempting to do the work while scrounging for grants and rotating through grad students might have prevented its being done at all, but the steady funding meant they could hire long-term researchers and overcome early obstacles that might have stymied them otherwise.</p>
<p>The group has produced dozens of published studies and prototypes (which you can peruse <a href="https://www.spacesolar.caltech.edu/publications">here</a>), including the lightest solar collector-transmitter made by an order of magnitude, and is now on the verge of launching its first space-based test satellite.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Launch] is currently expected to be Q1 2023,&#8221; co-director of the project Ali Hajimiri told TechCrunch. &#8220;It involves several demonstrators for space verification of key technologies involved in the effort, namely, wireless power transfer at distance, lightweight flexible photovoltaics and flexible deployable space structures.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186966" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186966" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186966" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png" alt="" width="1024" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png 1110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=768,547 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-diagram.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186966" class="wp-caption-text">Diagram showing how tiles like the one above could be joined together to form strips, then spacecraft, then arrays of spacecraft. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>These will be small-scale tests (about six feet across), but the vision is for something rather larger. Bigger than anything currently in space, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;The final system is envisioned to consist of multiple deployable modules in close formation flight and operating in synchronization with one another,&#8221; Hajimiri said. &#8220;Each module is several tens of meters on the side and the system can be built up by adding more modules over time.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186967" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186967" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186967" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png" alt="Image of how the final space solar installation could look, a kilometers-wide set of cells in orbit." width="637" height="491" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sspp-vision.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186967" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>Eventually the concept calls for a structure perhaps as large as 5-6 kilometers across. Don&#8217;t worry — it would be far enough out from Earth that you wouldn&#8217;t see a giant hexagon blocking out the stars. Power would be sent to receivers on the surface using directed, steerable microwave transmission. A few of these in orbit could beam power to any location on the planet full time.</p>
<p>Of course that is the vision, which is many, many years out if it is to take place at all. But don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking of this as having that single ambitious, one might even say grandiose, goal. The pursuit of this idea has produced advances in<a href="https://daedalus.caltech.edu/"> solar cells</a>, flexible space-based structures and <a href="https://chic.caltech.edu/publication/">wireless power transfer</a>, each of which can be applied in other areas. The vision may be the stuff of science fiction, but the science is progressing in a very grounded way.</p>
<p>For his part, Bren seems to be happy just to advance the ball on what he considers an important task that might not otherwise have been attempted at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a student researching the possible applications of space-based solar energy for many years,&#8221; he told Caltech. &#8220;My interest in supporting the world-class scientists at Caltech is driven by my belief in harnessing the natural power of the sun for the benefit of everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back with the SSPP ahead of launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With most popular online video games, there&#8217;s a <em>huge</em> gap between being a good player and a great one. A casual player might be able to hold their own against other casual players, only for a random pro to wander by and chew through everyone like they&#8217;re somehow playing with a different set of rules.</p>
<p>Could an AI-driven voice in your ear help close that gap, if only a bit? <a href="https://senpai.gg">SenpAI.GG</a>, a company out of Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch, thinks so.</p>
<p>Much of that aforementioned gap boils down to practice, muscle memory and — let&#8217;s face it — natural ability. But as a game gets older/bigger/more complex, the best players tend to have a wealth of one resource that&#8217;s oh-so-crucial, if not oh-so-fun to gather: information.</p>
<p>Which guns do the most damage at this range? Which character is best suited to counter that character on this map? Hell, what changed in that &#8220;minor update&#8221; that flashed across your screen as you were booting up the game? Wait, why is my favorite weapon suddenly so much harder to control?</p>
<p>Staying on top of all this information as players discover new tactics and updates shift the &#8220;meta&#8221; is a challenge in its own right. It usually involves lots of Twitch streams, lots of digging around Reddit threads and lots of poring over patch notes.</p>
<p>SenpAI.GG is looking to surface more of that information automatically and help new players get good, faster. Their desktop client presents you with information it thinks can help, post-game analysis on your strategies, plus in-game audio cues for the things you might not be great at tracking yet.</p>
<p>It currently supports a handful of games — League of Legends, Valorant and Teamfight Tactics — with the info it provides varying from game to game. In LoL, for example, it&#8217;ll look at both teams&#8217; selected champions and try to recommend the one you could pick to help most; in Valorant, meanwhile, it can give you an audio heads-up that one of your teammates is running low on health (<em>before</em> said teammate starts yelling at you to heal them), when you&#8217;ve forgotten to reload or how long you&#8217;ve got before the Spike (read: game-ending bomb) explodes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2186932" style="width: 1842px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186932" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2186932 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg" alt="" width="1832" height="1009" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg 1832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=1536,846 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/LoL.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1832px) 100vw, 1832px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186932" class="wp-caption-text">SenpAI.GG&#8217;s in-game overlay providing League of Legends insights. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SenpAI.GG</p></div></p>
<p>Just as important as the information it provides is the information it <em>won&#8217;t</em> provide. In my chat with him, SenpAI.GG founder Olcay Yilmazcoban seemed very aware that there&#8217;s a hard-to-define line here where &#8220;assistant&#8221; blurs into &#8220;cheating tool&#8221; — but the company follows certain rules to stay on the right side of things and prevent their players from getting banned.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t, for example, ever take action on a player&#8217;s behalf — they might fire an audio cue to say &#8220;hey, you should heal that teammate,&#8221; but they won&#8217;t press the button for you. They&#8217;ll only generate their real-time insights from what&#8217;s on <em>your</em> screen — not anything hidden within the running process. They also won&#8217;t do things like reveal an enemy&#8217;s location just because your teammate is also running the app and can see them. Think &#8220;good player standing over your shoulder,&#8221; not &#8220;wall hack.&#8221; The company says that they&#8217;re always within each game developer&#8217;s competitive fairness guidelines, and only work with approved/provided APIs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea because it&#8217;s one that, arguably, never gets old. With each new game they support, they&#8217;ve got a new potential audience to serve. Meanwhile, it&#8217;s not as if the old games/insights will expire — a game&#8217;s big ol&#8217; book-of-stuff-you-need-to-know tends to only get bigger and more complex as a game ages and the patches pile up. There are games I&#8217;ve been playing for <em>years</em> where I&#8217;d still love a voice assistant that says &#8220;Oh hey, the recoil on the gun you just picked up has gotten way more intense since the last time you played.&#8221; SenpAI.GG isn&#8217;t there yet, but there&#8217;s a ton of natural room for growth.</p>
<p>Yilmazcoban tells me that they currently have over 400,000 active users, with a team of 11 people working on it. The base app is free, with plans to offer advanced features for a couple bucks a month.</p>

<p>Growth teams are twice as likely to appear among businesses growing their ARR by 100% or more annually. What&#8217;s more, they also seem to be more common after product-market fit has been achieved — usually after a company has reached about $5 million to $10 million in revenue.</p>

<h2>How do you hire an early growth leader?</h2>
<p>According to responses from <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">product benchmarks surveys</a>, growth teams have transitioned dramatically from reporting to marketing and sales to reporting directly to the CEO.</p>
<p>Some of the early writing on growth teams says that they can be structured individually as their own standalone team or as a SWAT model, where experts from various other departments in the organization converge on a regular cadence to solve for growth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186835" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186835" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2186835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png" alt="Graph showing more growth teams now report to CEOs than marketing, sales or product" width="977" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png 977w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OVPicture3.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2186835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenView Partners</p></div></p>
<p>My experience, and the <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-product-benchmarks/">data I’ve collected</a> from business-user focused software companies, has led me to the conclusion that growth teams in business software should not be structured as “SWAT” teams, with cross-functional leadership coming together to think critically about growth problems facing the business. I find that if problems don’t have a real owner, they’re not going to get solved. Growth issues are no different and are often deprioritized unless it’s someone’s job to think about them.</p>

<p>I put early growth hires into a few simple buckets. You’ve got:</p>
<p><strong>Product-minded growth experts:</strong> These folks are all about optimizing the user experience, reducing friction and expanding usage. They’re usually pretty analytical and might have product, data or MarketingOps backgrounds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Brick-and-mortar stores forced to close due to pandemic lockdowns had to quickly pivot to an online-only model. Understandably, newcomers to the digital retail scene found themselves behind the curve in attracting online buyers, particularly in the face of popular established events like Amazon Prime Day. This year’s Prime Day, held June 21-22, was reportedly the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amazon-says-prime-day-delivered-two-biggest-days-ever-for-small-medium-sized-businesses-1030547652?op=1">biggest ever on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Online retailers that have opted to forge their own path to generate sales often wonder how they can compete with Amazon.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network. Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point. Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The reality is that Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network. Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point because Amazon’s distribution network is so fast. Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel &#8212; without having to become a third-party seller on Amazon’s platform.</p>
<p>The following are seven key tips that are relevant for online retailers that want to attract and retain customers without having to partner with Amazon or to try to beat it at its own game.</p>
<h2>Gain a 360-degree view of the customer</h2>
<p>An online retailer needs to consider what kind of experience it wants to create; customers expect smooth processes on every step of their online shopping journey.</p>
<p>One idea is to implement a consumer data platform that will help the retailer gain the best insights into their customers: who they are and what they like, which websites they frequent and other relevant information. Retailers can use this data to then target customers with ads for products they’ll actually want to buy. Consumer data platforms can even help online retailers target consumers across platforms as well as in the store.</p>
<h2>Ensure smooth and glitch-free pre-sale transactions</h2>
<p>One of the biggest frustrations with online retailers is the performance of a website, from getting on the site through the closing of the sale. If something fails or glitches at any point in the process of searching for a product and paying for it, the customer will leave and not come back.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem involves a lot of testing of the user interface to ensure a good user experience. Tests should be done on all e-commerce segments on a site, including the basket and ad banners. By inserting tags along the customer journey, a retailer can track lost sales and see where problems happen on their website.</p>
<h2>Offer a broad variety of payment options</h2>
<p>As a payment option, PayPal recently experienced a record <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-posted-record-payment-volume-growth-q3-2020-2020-11?op=1">36% year-on-year growth in payment volume</a> between the third quarter of 2019 and Q3 2020. Despite PayPal’s popularity, Amazon does not accept it as a form of payment.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists are chatting this week about a recent piece from The Information titled “<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-end-of-venture-capital-as-we-know-it">The End of Venture Capital as We Know It</a>.” As with nearly everything you read, the article in question is a bit more nuanced than its headline. Its author, <a href="https://twitter.com/lessin">Sam Lessin</a>, makes some pretty good points. But I don’t fully agree with his conclusions, and want to talk about why.</p>
<p>This will be fun, and, because it’s Friday, both relaxed and cordial. (For fun, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIk2cw-VSOQ">long-ass podcast</a> I participated in with Lessin last year.)</p>
<h2>A capital explosion</h2>
<p>Lessin notes that venture capitalists once made risky wagers on companies that often withered away. Higher-than-average investment risk meant that returns from winning bets had to be very lucrative, or else the venture model would have failed.</p>
<p>Thus, venture capitalists sold their capital dearly to founders. The prices that venture capitalists have historically paid for startup equity in high-growth tech upstarts make IPO pops appear de minimis; it’s the VCs who make out like bandits when a tech company floats, not the bankers. The Wall Street crew just gets a final lap at the milk saucer.</p>
<p>Over time, however, things changed. Founders could lean on AWS instead of having to spend equity capital on server racks and colocation. The process of building software and taking it to market became better understood by more people.</p>
<p>Even more, recurring fees overtook the traditional method of selling software for a one-time price. This made the revenues of software companies less like those of video game companies, driven by episodic releases and dependent on the market’s reception of the next version of any particular product.</p>
<p>As SaaS took over, software revenues kept their lucrative gross margin profile but became both longer-lasting and more dependable. They got better. And easier to forecast to boot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, prices went up for software companies &#8212; public and private.</p>
<p>Another result of the revolution in both software construction and distribution &#8212; higher-level programming languages, smartphones, app stores, SaaS and, today, on-demand pricing coupled to API delivery &#8212; was that more money could pile into the companies busy writing code. Lower risk meant that other forms of capital found startup investing &#8212; super-late stage to begin with, but increasingly earlier in the startup lifecycle &#8212; not just possible, but rather attractive.</p>
<p>With more capital varieties taking interest in private tech companies thanks in part to reduced risk, pricing changed. Or, as Lessin puts it, thanks to better market ability to metricize startup opportunity and risk, “investors across the board [now] price [startups] more or less the same way.”</p>
<p>You can see where this is going: If that’s the case, then the model of selling expensive capital for huge upside becomes a bit soggy. If there is less risk, then venture capitalists can’t charge as much for their capital. Their return profile might change, with cheaper and more plentiful money chasing deals, leading to higher prices and lower returns.</p>
<p>The result of all of the above is Lessin’s lede: “All signs seem to indicate that by 2022, for the first time, nontraditional tech investors — including hedge funds, mutual funds and the like — will invest more in private tech companies than traditional Silicon Valley-style venture capitalists will.”</p>
<p>Capital crowding into the parts of finance once reserved for the high priests of venture means that the VCs of the world are finding themselves often fighting for deals with all sorts of new, and wealthier, players.</p>
<p>The result of this, per Lessin, is that venture “firms that grew up around software and internet investing and consider themselves venture capitalists&#8221; must &#8220;enter the bigger pond as a fairly small fish, or go find another small pond.”</p>
<h2>Yeah, but</h2>
<p>The obvious critique of Lessin’s argument is one that he makes himself, namely that what he is discussing is not as relevant to seed investing. As Lessin puts it, his argument’s impact on seed investing is “far less clear.”</p>
<p>Agreed. Sure, it&#8217;s the end of venture capital as we know it. But it&#8217;s not the end of venture capital, because if capitalism is going to continue, there&#8217;s always going to need to be risky-ass shit for VCs to bet on at the bottom.</p>
<p>The factors that made later-stage SaaS investing something that even idiots can make a few dollars doing become scarce the earlier one looks in the startup world. Investing in areas other than software compounds this effect; if you try to treat biotech startups as less risky than before simply because public clouds exist, you are going to fuck up.</p>
<p>So the Lessin argument matters less in seed-stage and earlier investing than it does in the later stages of startup backing, and doubly less when it comes to earlier investing in non-software companies.</p>
<p>While it’s a little-known fact, some venture capitalists still invest in startups that are not software-focused. Sure, nearly every startup involves code, but you can make a lot of money in a lot of ways by building startups, especially tech startups. The figuring-out of SaaS investing does not mean that investing in marketplaces, for example, has enjoyed a similar decline in risk.</p>
<p>So, the VCs-are-dead concept is less true for seed and non-software startups.</p>
<p>Is Lessin correct, then, that the game really has changed for middle- and late-stage software investing? Of course it has, but I think that he takes the concept of less risky, private-market software investing in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>First, even if private-market investing in software has a lower risk profile than before, it’s not zero. Many software startups will fail or stall out and sell for a modest sum at best. As many in today’s market as before? Probably not, but still some.</p>
<p>This means that the act of picking still matters; we can vamp as long as we’d like about how venture capitalists are going to have to pay more competitive prices for deals, but VCs could retain an edge in startup selection. This can limit downside, but may also do quite a lot more.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">Anshu Sharma</a> of <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/">Skyflow</a> &#8212; and formerly of Salesforce and Storm Ventures, where I first met him &#8212; made an argument about this particular point earlier this week with which I am sympathetic.</p>
<p>Sharma thinks, and I agree, that venture winners are getting bigger. Recall that a billion-dollar private company was once a rare thing. Now they are built daily. And the biggest software companies aren’t worth the few hundred billion dollars that Microsoft was largely valued at between 1998 and 2019. Today they are worth several trillion dollars.</p>
<p>More simply, a more attractive software market in terms of risk and value creation means that outliers are even more outlier-y than before. This means that venture capitalists that pick well, and, yes, go earlier than they once did, can still generate bonkers returns. Perhaps even more so than before.</p>
<p>This is what I am hearing about certain funds regarding their present-day performance. If Lessin’s point held up as strongly as he states it, I reckon that we’d see declining rates of return at top VCs. We’re not, at least based on what I am hearing. (Feel free to tell me if I am wrong.)</p>

<p>So yes, venture capital is changing, and the larger funds really are looking more and more like entirely different sorts of capital managers than the VCs of yore. Capitalism is happening to venture capital, changing it as the world of money itself evolves. Services were one way that VCs tried to differentiate from one another, and probably from non-venture capital sources, though that was discussed less when The Services Wars were taking off.</p>
<p>But even the rapid-fire Tiger can’t invest in every company, and not all its bets will pay out. You might decide that you’d be better off putting capital into a slightly smaller fund with a slightly more measured cadence of dealmaking, allowing selection at the hand of fund managers that you trust to allocate your funds among other pooled capital to bet for you. So that you might earn better-than-average returns.</p>
<p>You know, the venture model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">V2Food is one of many new contenders in the alternative protein space, founded in Australia but now setting its sights on Europe, Asia and beyond. It has a few key advantages over the competition, and with €45 million in new funding it may be finding its way to plates in the Eurozone soon.</p>
<p>The company has seen strong uptake in its home market, and the first goal is to be No. 1 in Australia, said CEO and founder Nick Hazell, formerly of MasterFoods and PepsiCo R&amp;D. But in the meantime they&#8217;ll be expanding their presence in Asia, where partner Burger King has launched a Whopper with their patty, and in Europe, where the product&#8217;s minimal suspicious elements come into play.</p>
<p>Currently v2Food makes plant-based ground beef and patties, sausages and a ready-made Bolognese sauce. Obviously they have strong competition in those categories, which are sort of the opening play of most alternative protein companies. But v2Food has a leg up on many of them in two ways.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2186886" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2186886" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2186886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg" alt="A package of v2Food's ground meat and someone cooking it in a kitchen." width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg 2072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=2048,1307 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/v2food-ground1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2186886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> v2Food</p></div></p>
<p>First, v2Food products are made, or at least can be made, using &#8220;any standard meat production facility.&#8221; That&#8217;s a big plus for scaling and a minus for cost, since economies of scale are already in play. The processes for creating and mixing the plant-derived and other artificial substances that make up alternative proteins in general aren&#8217;t always amenable to existing infrastructure. This also opens the door to partnerships with existing meat companies that might have balked at having to switch processes. (Incidentally, Hazell noted that what they&#8217;re aiming for isn&#8217;t so much about replacing traditional meats so much as growing the market in a new direction, a philosophy those companies may appreciate.)</p>
<p>Second, as the press release announcing the fundraise puts it, &#8220;v2food products do not contain GMOs, preservatives, colors or flavorings. This makes it an ideal product for the European market, where the many large competitors have been unable to enter the market due to strict regulation.&#8221; It&#8217;s also a soft advantage for winning over in-store buyers vacillating between two plant-based options; who hasn&#8217;t on occasion ended up going for the one with fewer ingredients that proudly touts its lack of preservatives and such? The alt-protein buying demographic is likely especially sensitive to this consideration.</p>
<p>The €45 million round is a &#8220;B Plus,&#8221; led by European impact fund Astanor, with participation from Huaxing Growth Capitol Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">Main Sequence</a> and ABC World Asia. The money is going toward both R&amp;D and scaling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1kfQqRZs0D"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">Founded by Australia&#8217;s national science agency, Main Sequence launches $250M AUD deep tech fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founded by Australia&#8217;s national science agency, Main Sequence launches $250M AUD deep tech fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/embed/#?secret=1kfQqRZs0D" data-secret="1kfQqRZs0D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This funding is an important step towards v2food’s goal of transforming the way the world produces food,&#8221; said Hazell. &#8220;It’s imperative that we scale quickly because these global issues need immediate solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end a large portion will go toward simply creating enough product to meet demand. They&#8217;re also doubling R&amp;D spend to both accelerate new products and improve the existing ones. And rather than import the necessary ingredients to Australia, they&#8217;re exploring the possibility of building a local manufacturing facility there. With luck and a bit of plant-based elbow grease, the region could become a net exporter, propping up the local economy as well as building up v2Food&#8217;s resilience and cutting costs.</p>
<p>The Europe expansion is still a twinkle in the company&#8217;s (and Astanor&#8217;s) eye, for even with its simplicity and non-GMO origins, it&#8217;s not trivial to launch a new product in the European market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michelle Davey&#8217;s pitch to Jordan Nof of Tusk Venture Partners about Wheel, a startup focused on providing a full suite of virtual care solutions to clinicians, was front-loaded with early metrics. It may not be standard practice to start with the numbers, especially early on, but she explained to us why she chose that strategy — and Nof told us why it worked.</p>
<p>Davey and Nof joined us on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live and went into detail on why Tusk was eager to finance Wheel, walking us through the startup&#8217;s Series A pitch deck and sharing which slides and bits clinched the deal.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a weekly virtual event series meant to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We sit down with investors and the founders they finance to hear what brought them together, what they saw in each other and how they work together moving forward. We also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where founders in the audience can pitch their startups to our outstanding speakers.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone live on Wednesdays at noon PDT, but the on-demand content is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. You can check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL library here</a>.</p>
<h2>When to lead with traction</h2>
<p>Davey emphasized the importance of not sticking to a rigid format for building a pitch deck. She said it&#8217;s important to instead focus on crafting your pitch around what makes you appealing and unique. That should be on the foreground and featured prominently.</p>
<p>For Wheel, that meant leading with traction, since the company had impressive uptake even early on. That remained true for their recent Series B raise, too.</p>

Just a few weeks ago, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velodyne Lidar, the sensor company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">that went </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public a year ago when it merged with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">., reported its <a href="https://ir.velodynelidar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/velodyne-lidar-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results">second quarter earnings Thursday</a>, results that show a company spending more to find new customers for its products while grappling with an increasingly expensive internal drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">Velodyne’s CEO Anand Gopalan resigned</a>, taking $8 million in equity compensation with him, according to the company&#8217;s second-quarter report. </span>At the time of Gopalan’s resignation, the company restated its business outlook for 2021 revenue, noting that its guidance of between $77 million and $94 million remained unchanged.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Earlier in the year, founder David Hall was removed as chairman of the board and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, lost her role of chief marketing officer following an investigation by the board into the couple for “inappropriate behavior.” The legal fees involved in this debacle set the company back $1.4 million this quarter, and $3.7 million for the first half of 2021, according to Velodyne CFO Drew Hamer.</span></p>
<p>The board&#8217;s fight with the Halls has escalated. In a May letter, David Hall blamed the SPAC, specifically the SPAC-appointed members of the combined company’s board, for its poor financial performance, and called for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal">resignation of Gopalan and two board members</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Velodyne Lidar CEO resigns in latest internal drama&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/embed/#?secret=BXUpFGEygk" data-secret="BXUpFGEygk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a call with investors Thursday, Hamer also said general and administrative expenses are expected to increase by about 35% in 2021 due to increased public company and legal expenses, meaning the struggle is not over. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first quarter to the second, there was already a 21% increase, from $17 million to $20.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;general and administrative expenses&#8221; category falls under the company’s broader operating expenses, which were $84.8 million this quarter, about double last quarter’s spend. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rising legal costs at the company are only part of its accelerating cost profile. The company is also investing heavily in growth, namely in sales and marketing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large majority of operating expenses were spent on sales and marketing. Velodyne spent $47.2 million in the second quarter, which is up massively from $7.1 million in the first quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, companies spend about 11.3% of their total revenue on marketing budgets, </span><a href="https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/how-much-budget-for-online-marketing-in-2014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a 2020 CMO survey</span></a>, though that is a broad metric.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s important to note that the full impact of sales and marketing spend is never fully realized in the quarter in which that capital is put to work. In other words, we don&#8217;t know if Velodyne&#8217;s expanded Q2 sales and marketing spend has brought in more business.</span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue eased between the first and second quarters, falling from $17.7 million to $13.6 million. For a company investing so heavily in sales to see revenue decline is not encouraging, even if the bulk of results stemming from Q2 spend may not show up until the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings report.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Velodyne is betting that its efforts will lead to accelerating sales in coming quarters. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pg1iVlscZG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/">As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adapt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adapt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/as-autonomy-stalls-lidar-companies-learn-to-adapt/embed/#?secret=pg1iVlscZG" data-secret="pg1iVlscZG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it expects to make an additional $46 to $62 million revenue in the second half of the year due to an increase in demand for lidar products. While Q2’s total revenue was actually less than Q1’s, the company&#8217;s product-based revenue rose around 30%, which Hamer attributed to “renewed demand for lidar sensors from customers with delayed purchases due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pipeline continues to grow,” said Hamer. “We had 213 projects on August 1, up from 198 projects at May 1&#8230;Included in the signed and awarded pipeline are new ADAS multiyear agreements, which we expect will begin to ramp starting in 2026.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamer estimated that through 2025, Velodyne has the opportunity for more than $1 billion in revenue from signed and awarded projects, plus a pipeline of projects that are not yet signed and awarded that could bring the company to $4.5 billion in potential revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of April,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/faraday-future-signs-velodyne-exclusive-lidar-supplier-luxury-ev-2021-04-29/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Velodyne was selected by EV company Faraday Future</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an exclusive lidar supplier for its flagship luxury electric car FF 91, which is due to be launched next year. Faraday’s cars would use the Velarray H800 lidar sensors to power their autonomous driving system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Velodyne has some other existing partnerships, but it faces steep competition in the automotive space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminar, for example, has deals with major OEMs like Volvo and Toyota, and it </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/luminar-buys-one-its-chip-suppliers-bolster-self-driving-car-sensor-2021-07-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently bought one of its chip suppliers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that it wouldn’t have to be held up like everyone else in the industry, including Velodyne, by the semiconductor shortage. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/china-lidar-hesai-300-million-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hesai is also seeing some traction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with customers like Lyft, Nuro, Bosch, Navya and Chinese robotaxi operators Baidu, WeRide and AutoX. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kL76KlloVZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/">Argo&#8217;s new lidar sensor could help Ford, VW deploy self-driving vehicles at scale</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Argo&#8217;s new lidar sensor could help Ford, VW deploy self-driving vehicles at scale&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/embed/#?secret=kL76KlloVZ" data-secret="kL76KlloVZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Velodyne, which has long been the dominant supplier in the industry, has lost some customers more recently.</p>
<p>For instance, Ford, which had originally backed Velodyne, divested its stake in the company and placed its bets on Argo AI, which is supplying the automaker with its the autonomous vehicle technology. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/">Argo had upped its game by drastically improving its in-house lidar sensor</a>, meaning it would no longer need to rely on Velodyne. That had a ripple effect and impacted Veoneer, which had partnered with Velodyne to produce the lidar for Ford.</p>
