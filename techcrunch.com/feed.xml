										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm%21id%3D10439388%40fsbMessage.html">announced</a> on Friday that it has raided and shut down the operations of the notorious REvil ransomware gang.</p>
<p>The unprecedented move — which will undoubtedly send a message to other ransomware groups operating out of the country — saw the Russian authorities conduct raids at 25 addresses across the Moscow, St. Petersburg, Leningrad, and the Lipetsk regions that belonged to 14 suspected members of REvil.</p>
<p>The gang, which shut down its operations in July but before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">a failed comeback in September</a>, is believed to have orchestrated some of the most damaging attacks of the past 12 months, including those targeting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jbs-paid-11-million-to-resolve-ransomware-attack-11623280781">JBS Foods</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FSB said it seized more than 426 million rubles and €500,000 (about $6 million), as well as $600,000 in cash, and cryptocurrency wallets, computers, and 20 high-end cars.</p>
<p>In a statement, the FSB said it conducted the search operation at the request of the U.S. authorities, which were notified of their results.</p>
<p>The detained members of the ransomware gang were charged under Russian law for the alleged &#8220;illegal circulation of means of payment. Russian authorities have not released the names of any of the suspects.</p>
<p>“As a result of joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the organized criminal community ceased to exist, the information infrastructure used for criminal purposes was neutralized,” the FSB said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>News of the FSB&#8217;s surprise operation comes just two months after the U.S. Department of Justice charged a 22-year-old Ukrainian citizen linked to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">REvil ransomware</a> gang for orchestrating the July ransomware attack against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">U.S. technology firm Kaseya</a>. Seven other REvil gang members were also arrested throughout 2021 following operations coordinated by Europol. In July, President Biden urged Russia to follow suit, pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action to disrupt these criminal gangs.</p>
<p>The action taken by the FSB also comes just hours after a major cyberattack took down government websites in Ukraine on Friday, including websites for the foreign ministry, national security and defense council, and the government&#8217;s cabinet of ministers. Officials said it was too early to draw any conclusions but they pointed to a “long record” of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo Via, the autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s trucking and cargo transportation unit, is expanding its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">existing partnership with logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services</a> from a pilot into a long-term strategic alliance.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, J.B. Hunt will be Waymo Via&#8217;s first launch customer for fully autonomous, driverless freight routes, which Waymo expects to reach within the next few years.</p>
<p>Waymo and J.B. Hunt began a &#8220;test run&#8221; in 2021 along the I-45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas, one of the country&#8217;s busiest trade corridors. Waymo&#8217;s Daimler trucks, powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, delivered 862,179 pounds of freight by the end of the pilot, with no crashes or speeding events, 100% on-time pickup and delivery and 100% freight intact, <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/what-we-learned-from-our-initial-trial.html">according to the company</a>. Each of the runs were completed with a commercially licensed truck driver and a software technician onboard to monitor operations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257867" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Our pilot last year with Waymo Via really helped us get a hands-on understanding of how autonomous driving technology could be implemented within our operations,” said Craig Harper, chief sustainability officer and executive vice president at J.B. Hunt, in a statement. “This strategic alliance will continue that momentum and further explore the intricate details that would make this a value-driven solution for customers.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257901" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257901" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png" alt="" width="965" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png 965w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-13-4.30.11-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257901" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Waymo</p></div></p>
<p>In 2022 and beyond, the companies intend to launch several more pilots along the same corridor in Texas to prepare for driverless autonomous operations.</p>
<p>Waymo did not share what specific goals it hopes to achieve for its next pilot with J.B. Hunt, other than to firm up the company&#8217;s driver-as-a-service model, which involves Waymo partnering with an OEM like Daimler to build autonomous trucks equipped with the Waymo Driver. Those trucks will be purchased directly from fleets or carriers, like J.B. Hunt and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ryder-to-build-logistics-network-with-autonomous-trucking-company-embark/"> serviced by partners like Ryder</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the long-term vision,&#8221; Julianne McGoldrick, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the interim as we scale up to that vision, we have our test fleet of trucks, and the pilots that we&#8217;ll do with those and with our autonomous specialists are really to gain that operational practice so that when we do reach fully autonomous operations, we have all the foundations in place to haul freight with no human driver for J.B. Hunt and customers like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the course of the Waymo-J.B. Hunt partnership, the two companies also plan to conduct joint operational and market studies to learn more about their collective progress using self-driving trucks, as well as explore a technology integration with J.B. Hunt 360, the company&#8217;s digital freight matching platform.</p>
<p>Of course, Waymo isn&#8217;t the only self-driving truck on the roads in Texas, or elsewhere. <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One of Waymo Via&#8217;s competitors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/">TuSimple, recently completed its first driverless autonomous trucking run, </a>which effectively puts its tech at a more progressive milestone. Aurora and Kodiak Robotics are also testing and carrying freight in Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> That doesn&#8217;t worry Waymo – the Alphabet-owned strategy is linked more tightly with its partners than with ticking off autonomous boxes, McGoldrick says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I think what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of partnerships or collaborations in the industry have been primarily centered around one-off trial runs or one-off pilots, and there hasn&#8217;t been much meat to them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re entering this multi-year deal with multiple components that really cover everything and show that we&#8217;re going really deep with our partners, as opposed to just doing a pilot for pilot&#8217;s sake. We&#8217;re really crafting what our fully autonomous launch will look like together with our partners so that it&#8217;s as successful as possible when we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;  </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brands can collect customer data from dozens of touch points, analyze it and make smarter decisions about how to market their products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daasity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daasity</a>, an e-commerce analytics and data company, secured $15 million in Series A funding as it continues developing its approach to helping consumer brands better leverage their customer data to make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>VMG Catalyst led the oversubscribed round and was joined by existing investors Cove Fund, Exeter Capital, 1855 Capital, Mooring Ventures, Okapi Venture Capital and Serra Ventures. This gives the company $20.7 million in total funding to date, CEO Dan LeBlanc told TechCrunch via email.</p>
<p>The company’s technology enables brands to pull in all of their data from different places, like Shopify, Amazon, Facebook and Klaviyo, analyze it and push it to marketing channels to optimize customer experiences based on insights from a historical performance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There have never been more consumer product brands, and competition among them is at an all-time high,” LeBlanc said. “Brands win by having access to the right data, which leads to faster and more confident decision-making. Data demands have never been higher, and we are investing in the data infrastructure to get brands the access to the data they need.”</p>
<p>Daasity is working with more than 1,600 brands, including Manscaped, Vuori and Caraway Home, and in the past year grew its annual recurring revenue by 300%, while also growing its headcount by 100%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will enable further employee growth, with LeBlanc expecting to grow another 160% by the end of 2022. The company is also investing in technology development for better data accessibility, data sources and educational resources for better insight into results. It will also be working on more personalized customer data.</p>
<p>Next up, the company will be heads down in making brands’ data infrastructure modular by allowing the ability to configure components of their data infrastructure — as easily as they select food from a menu, LeBlanc said. It is also adding 35 integrations, like data sources, warehousing options, transformation capabilities and visualization tools.</p>
<p>Brooke Kiley, partner at VMG Catalyst, said in a written statement that the firm was “thrilled to continue our partnership with Dan and the Daasity team as they enter their next phase of growth. We consistently see how difficult it is for brands to act on their data, yet there is a greater need than ever. It is vital to utilize data to succeed in today’s competitive e-commerce environment. Daasity makes data accessible to all brands, empowering them with actionable insights and the ability to enrich their marketing channels with essential customer data.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous driving startups in China are in an arms race to put passengers in their machine-driven vehicles. Every few weeks, news arrives that another major player has got the greenlight to launch a new pilot program or a small-scale service.</p>
<p>These press releases, often dotted with regulatory jargon and flowery language to aggrandize the companies&#8217; progress, can be confusing. That’s why we put together this post summarizing the progress of China’s major robotaxi operators &#8212; <strong>AutoX, Baidu, Deeproute.ai, Didi, Momenta, Pony.ai and WeRide</strong> &#8212; in 2021 while trying to parse what their announcements actually mean.</p>
<p>Most of the major players have been testing drivered (autonomous vehicles with in-car safety operators) and driverless vehicles for some time in China, so this post will focus on their public-facing services that run on a regular basis. While navigating the costs, safety and regulations around robotaxis, these companies have also dabbled into areas that are quicker to scale, such as self-driving trucks, goods-hauling vans and city buses, though robotaxis remain their focus in the long run.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>A few things to note about China’s autonomous driving space</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, it&#8217;s worth highlighting a few circumstances unique to China&#8217;s autonomous vehicle sector.</p>
<ol>
<li>Road conditions in the country can vary greatly. An autonomous driving test that takes place in an industrial park in suburban Shenzhen, for instance, will encounter much simpler traffic than one that runs in a meandering urban village downtown.</li>
<li>Regulations on autonomous vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can differ across provinces</a> &#8212; and even different districts within the same city. A company that obtains approval to run a fully driverless test in one city isn&#8217;t necessarily more technologically advanced than its peers; it could simply mean it&#8217;s cozy with a local regulator with a progressive attitude toward self-driving.</li>
<li>Some regional governments are targeting smart transportation as their growth strategy. Naturally, they are keen to support autonomous vehicle startups. Authorities may give an informal nod to unmanned driving tests in their jurisdictions well before national or city-level regulations are rubberstamped.</li>
<li>Government support can also manifest in ways like tax breaks, access to favorable land use and cheap office space. That&#8217;s in part why China&#8217;s major autonomous vehicle startups are concentrated in well-resourced cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Suzhou.</li>
<li>Local governments in China often set up pilot zones to spur the development of emerging technologies, like self-driving. Such initiatives allow companies to experiment without the usual regulatory constraints that rein in the more mature industries.</li>
<li>As of today, no city in China has issued a permit for driverless robotaxis, which would allow an autonomous car to transport the public without a safety operator as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waymo and Cruise</a> can in San Francisco. A few cities have granted permits for fully driverless tests on public roads.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.autox.ai/blog/20200817.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In August 2020</a>, AutoX began offering drivered robotaxi rides to the public in Shanghai&#8217;s Jiading. Users can book trips through Alibaba&#8217;s Amap navigation map, which AutoX said was the &#8220;first time&#8221; a robotaxi service had become available on a major Chinese ride-hailing platform.</p>
<p>Jiading, a suburban district of Shanghai, has attracted<a href="https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw48088/20201127/c6a4f12a69e943ebb169a44f5e01ee4a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a clutch of major automakers and OEMs</a> like SAIC Auto, Volkswagon, NIO, Toyota, Baidu, Didi and Delphi to set up offices. AutoX <a href="https://www.autox.ai/blog/20200410.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in 2020</a> that it had struck a deal with the Shanghai government to put 100 &#8220;self-driving vehicles&#8221; on the city&#8217;s public roads.</p>
<p>In January 2021, AutoX <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/c1n91evDCjk0su1MisDgaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> a driverless robotaxis service in Shenzhen&#8217;s Pingshan, an industrial district that is refashioning itself as a &#8220;<a href="http://www.sz.gov.cn/szhlwzwfw/szhlwzwfw/cgzs/content/post_1419942.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart city</a>.&#8221; In November, AutoX <a href="http://www.szpsq.gov.cn/english/News/Photos/content/post_9377658.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the program had covered the entire 168 square kilometers of Pingshan, which is nearly three times Manhattan&#8217;s size.</p>
<p>Just a month before, AutoX <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put a fleet of 25 unmanned autonomous vehicles</a> on the public roads of Shenzhen in a &#8220;test&#8221;. A Chinese auto news blog <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_z5BfvBp5ExIqzDyoSNjPA">reported</a> that the startup went ahead without a license from the local transportation regulator, though AutoX told TechCrunch that it had obtained &#8220;government support.&#8221; We were unable to reach the relevant department at the time.</p>
<p>Altogether, AutoX said it has &#8220;several hundred&#8221; robotaxis on the road.</p>

<h2><strong>Baidu Apollo Go</strong></h2>
<p>Apollo Go is the autonomous driving front of search engine titan Baidu, the Beijing-based internet firm founded in 2000. Baidu kickstarted its autonomous driving unit in <a href="https://tech.qq.com/a/20151214/045792.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 2015</a>, around the same time most of its startup competitors were born.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In November 2021, Apollo Go was authorized to provide paid robotaxi service in China’s &#8220;<a href="http://kw.beijing.gov.cn/art/2021/11/26/art_1134_620476.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first-ever demo zone for commercial autonomous driving</a>&#8221; in Beijing.</p>
<p>The fleet of 67 vehicles, monitored by in-car safety drivers, was Apollo Go&#8217;s &#8220;first commercial deployment&#8221; on open roads. The service was available for hailing via Apollo Go&#8217;s app and ran every day from 7 am to 10 pm.</p>
<p>Apollo Go got to partake in China&#8217;s &#8220;first commercial robotaxi demo zone,&#8221; though it wasn&#8217;t the first to offer rides for compensations (spoiler: see WeRide&#8217;s section below). But the event carried much symbolic weight. The pilot area, spanning 60 square kilometers, sits inside the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone, a state-level economic project in suburban Yizhuang. It introduced a regulatory framework to stipulate how robotaxi operators could utilize passenger data and price their services. Developments in the capital city could become a model for the rest of China.</p>
<p>Yizhuang isn&#8217;t only promoting robotaxis; other types of autonomous vehicles are also welcome in its broader &#8220;<a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-04/14/c_139880097.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected vehicles demo zone</a>.&#8221; A number of tech giants, including JD.com and Meituan, started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing unmanned delivery minivans there</a> last year.</p>
<p>The free version of Apollo Go is available to the public in certain areas of Guangzhou, Changsha and Cangzhou, and is currently <a href="https://apollo.auto/robotaxi/index_cn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting early testers in Shanghai</a>.</p>

<h2>Deeproute.ai</h2>
<p>Shenzhen-based Deeproute has made considerable progress for a company that&#8217;s merely two years old. In 2019, Zhou Guang founded Deeproute after he left his last autonomous driving venture Roadstar.ai amid company infighting. The young entrepreneur quickly garnered support for his new endeavor. Last September, Deeproute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/deeproute-l4-10000-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a whopping $300 million in a Series B round</a> from investors including Alibaba and Chinese automaker Geely.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In July, Deeproute deployed 20 drivered robotaxis on the public roads in<a href="https://www.deeproute.ai/en/news/detail.php?id=4&amp;bid=41&amp;cid=273" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shenzhen&#8217;s downtown Futian district</a>, which is close to its headquarters in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/harry-shum-microsoft-digital-finance-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech collaboration zone</a> established by the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The robotaxi service, which launched after the company obtained a <a href="https://www.163.com/dy/article/G89JVPN3055004XG.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permit</a> from Shenzhen&#8217;s transport regulator in April, is still free to the public with plans to charge passengers in the future, the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4caLBGn9Jvw&amp;ab_channel=DeepRoute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last March</a>, Deeproute&#8217;s robotaxi fleets, co-developed with state-owned Dongfeng Motor, began offering free rides to the public in Wuhan. The city in central China is another contender racing to <a href="http://en.whkfq.gov.cn/2021-06/10/c_632046.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become a pioneer in China&#8217;s autonomous driving field</a>.</p>

<h2>Didi</h2>
<p>The ride-hailing giant has been quieter than expected about its robotaxi ambitions, given it carved out an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/didi-chuxings-autonomous-driving-unit-is-now-an-indepedent-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> autonomous driving subsidiary</a> in 2019 and quickly raised a $500 million round for the new entity &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the single largest funding round in the industry</a> at the time.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if Didi has been distracted by other concerns. Shortly following its U.S. public listing last year, the firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit with a data probe</a> by Chinese regulators. In December, the Chinese ride hailing giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/chinas-ride-hailing-giant-is-delisting-from-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<h2>Momenta</h2>
<p>Unlike most other robotaxi operators, which focus on Level 4 fully autonomous driving tech, five-year-old Momenta is also touting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to automakers. This approach helps rake in short-term income but is questioned by industry observers as to whether the startup is devoting enough resources to real driverless tech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257246" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257246" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2257246" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/momenta-robotaxi.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257246" class="wp-caption-text">Robotaxis co-developed by Momenta and SAIC Motor / Photo: Momenta (2021)</p></div></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Suzhou-based Momenta has become one of the most funded autonomous vehicle startups in China. It has raised $2 billion from a group of high-profile investors, from General Motors, Daimler, Bosch, Toyota, Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC to Nio Capital, a fund overseen by Nio&#8217;s founder William Li.</p>
<p>Unlike most of its peers that have set up R&amp;D forces or are testing in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/momenta-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momenta picked Germany</a> as its launch pad for international expansion. In 2021, it opened an office in Stuttgart, the backyard of its investor Daimler.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In December 2021, Momenta and SAIC <a href="https://www.saicmotor.com/chinese/xwzx/xwk/2021/56470.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a free robotaxi service in certain parts of Shanghai</a>. Users could summon these drivered vehicles via SAIC&#8217;s app from 8 am to 10 pm every day. The program was &#8220;testing and validating potential commercial applications with 20 vehicles,&#8221; said Momenta. The program had plans to roll out in Suzhou and Shenzhen in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The company has won substantial support from the government of Suzhou, an affluent city adjacent to Shanghai. It has a joint venture with the Suzhou branch of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) to &#8220;scale up&#8221; robotaxi deployment in the city. SASAC is a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/xi-jinpings-ambitious-agenda-economic-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful government body</a> in China that has <a href="https://www.thewirechina.com/2021/02/07/the-long-arm-of-sasac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oversight of 100 or so large state-owned enterprises</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8L88zlA4uinBihnTnBeCNg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last July</a>, PonyPilot+ debuted in Jiading, Shanghai&#8217;s automotive hub. In June, Pony<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G810Pk0MHI4wjB1beQEkWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> added fully driverless cars</a> to its existing robotaxi fleet in Guangzhou.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p>In November, the California Department of Motor Vehicles notified Pony that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pony-ai-suspension-driverless-pilot-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was suspending its driverless testing permit</a> following a reported collision in Fremont. The decision came six months after Pony <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained the regulatory greenlight</a>. The company&#8217;s drivered testing permit in California wasn&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pony.ai/tech?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple manufacturers</a> have supplied Pony&#8217;s robotaxis, including Toyota&#8217;s Lexus, Hyundai, as well as China&#8217;s BYD and Aion.</p>
<h2>WeRide.ai</h2>
<p>WeRide and Pony share many roots. Both have bases in Guangzhou and California, with founders who hailed from Baidu&#8217;s autonomous driving team. Founded in 2017, WeRide raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $600 million</a> just within 2021. Its investors include state-owned GAC and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>
<p>In November 2019, WeRide&#8217;s drivered robotaxis began ferrying the public in a 144 square-kilometer area of Guangzhou. The service was a<a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/robo-taxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> collaboration with the government-owned Baiyun Taxi Group</a>, the largest taxi company in South China.</p>
<p>WeRide was able to charge passengers at Guangzhou&#8217;s taxi rate from the outset, which predated the paid services of Baidu and Pony in Beijing.</p>
<p>This is a familiar scenario where competitors clamor to label their programs the &#8220;first&#8221; in China. The claims are valid in their own right but deserve closer discernment. As an industry insider said, &#8220;Beijing is more influential as a policy bellwether;&#8221; but to businesses, the difference between running a paid robotaxi service in Beijing and Guangzhou &#8220;isn&#8217;t that big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s Beijing or Guangzhou, as long as the city has friendly policies, that&#8217;s good news. After all, robotaxi companies just want to test their operations,&#8221; the person said.</p>
<p>WeRide also operates a drivered robotaxi service in Wuhan.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. tests</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of November 2021</a>, WeRide held the testing permits for both drivered and driverless testing in California.</p>
<p><strong>OEM partners</strong></p>
<p>WeRide and its strategic investor GAC <a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/gac_investment-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in December that they planned to build a fleet of &#8220;tens of thousands of&#8221; robotaxis in the coming years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This newest raise comes just three months after Bolt took in a sizable $393 million in Series D funding.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Checkout technology company <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> continues to make quick work of attracting new capital. The company announced Friday $355 million in Series E financing to give Bolt an $11 billion valuation, according to sources close to the company.</p>
<p>Bolt’s one-click checkout product aims to give businesses the same technology Amazon has been known for since 1997, and at the same time, incorporates payments and fraud services meant to ensure transactions are real and payments can be accepted. In addition, shoppers can create an account once and then use those credentials across a network of hundreds of Bolt network brands.</p>
<p>This newest raise comes just three months after Bolt took in a sizable <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-series-d/">$393 million in Series D funding</a>. Including the Series E, Bolt’s total funding to date is nearly $1 billion. The company’s valuation is nearly double what it was at the Series D, Ryan Breslow, founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257873" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In discussing Bolt’s rise to the $1 billion mark, Breslow explained that the company operates in a space with competitors that are actually worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Depending on the source, that’s companies like Stripe, Shopify and Checkout.com.</p>
<p>“It may seem like a lot of money raised, but actually no, this is capital for us to be competitive,” he added. “We don’t just want to be on par with competitors, but be better. The capital will enable us to bring in the best talent, make strategic acquisitions and expand into Europe, which is important to us.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the international front, the company got a head start there in November after <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securing agreements with both Benefit Cosmetics and PrestaShop</a>, and when Bolt made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/bolt-acquisition-tipser-remote-checkout/">first-ever acquisition of Tipser</a>, a Swedish-based technology company enabling direct checkout on any digital surface.</p>
<p>“We saw how significant Tipser could be for Bolt,” Breslow said at the time. “They had been perfecting their embedded commerce technology for a decade and were the only formidable player. They were stronger than us in areas where we were weaker. It is very strategic to have them on our team.”</p>
<p>Two months later, he says the integration of Bolt’s native checkout and shopper experience with Tipser’s embedded commerce technology continues and that, together, they are already signing up some big customers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock led the Series E investment, with new investors Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase and H.I.G. Growth joining existing investors Activant Capital and Moore Strategic Ventures.</p>

<p>Ben Tsai, partner at Invus Opportunities, said via email that the e-commerce landscape provides “a huge opportunity to improve the online checkout experience, and retailers are realizing that they are losing customers as a result.”</p>
<p>“Bolt has a growing network of millions of shoppers who benefit from the ease of one-click checkout across Bolt’s expanding network of retailers,” he added. “We’re pleased to support Ryan and the ambitious Bolt team and see tremendous opportunity in the space that Bolt is disrupting.”</p>
<p>Over the past year, Bolt grew its gross merchandise value per merchant by 80% and saw increased accounts by 180% over 2020, while transactions grew 200% year over year. The company also says 100 million shoppers are poised to join the Bolt network over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Finally, after launching Conscious Culture, a playbook aimed at helping businesses create people-first work cultures, last May, it now counts nearly 80 companies and hundreds of customers in the collective.</p>
<p>Bolt currently has over 550 employees working remotely across over 200 cities. In addition to talent, acquisitions and international expansion, the new funding will also accelerate Bolt’s goals of putting out a flurry of new products this year.</p>

<p>Within the pipeline are key investments into areas, like social commerce, where native embedded commerce will be able to go on any channel: websites, chat bots, in-venue, video streams, games, you name it. Breslow expects this move will put Bolt’s checkout capabilities everywhere. Funding will also be pumped into expansion of consumer products to help shoppers shop more efficiently across Bolt’s network.</p>
<p>Going forward, Breslow sees Bolt unbundling the “Amazon gold standard” buying experience as it launches new products so that any business can not only have the one-click checkout, but also the seamless order tracking, fast returns, fast shipping and membership benefits — all technologies that gave Amazon an early advantage.</p>
<p>When asked if becoming a public company was near, Breslow said that it was not in the immediate horizon nor the end goal.</p>
<p>“We have one goal, and that is to build the greatest company ever,” he added.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,” the report said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The attacks primarily targeted investment firms and centralized exchanges. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report stated that the hackers siphoned the funds from the organizations’ internet-connected “hot wallets” into DPRK-controlled addresses by using complex tactics including phishing lures, code exploits, malware, and advanced social engineering.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,” the report said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2021, Ethereum and Bitcoin accounted for 58% and 20% of the funds, respectively; 22% came from ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More than 65% of North Korea&#8217;s stolen funds were laundered through mixers &#8212; software tools that pool and scramble digital assets from thousands of addresses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">North Korea also owns unlaundered crypto funds, which are believed to be worth $170 million, from 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It’s unclear why the hackers would still be sitting on these funds, but it could be that they are hoping law enforcement interest in the cases will die down, so they can cash out without being watched. Whatever the reason may be, the length of time that DPRK is willing to hold on to these funds is illuminating, because it suggests a careful plan, not a desperate and hasty one,” the report said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FinDev Canada has injected $13 million into Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund (<a href="https://shellfoundation.org/focus-areas/">EEGF</a>), which invests in early and growth-stage energy startups in sub-Saharan Africa. Part of the funding that will go towards increasing access to clean energy for off-grid households and businesses in the region.</p>
<p>The $120 million EEGF, which was founded in 2019 by the Shell Foundation &#8212; and co-funded by UKaid and the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank FMO, extends financing in the form of debt (catalytic or mezzanine) or equity to businesses in the energy sector. The EEGF is managed by Triple Jump; an impact investment manager and advised by Persistent; a climate venture builder.</p>
<p>FinDev Canada participated in fundraising through 2X Canada, an impact investment facility driving the economic empowerment of low-income and underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>FinDev Canada vice president and chief investment officer, Paulo Martelli, in a <a href="https://www.findevcanada.ca/en/news/findev-canada-and-its-2x-canada-facility-invest-energy-entrepreneurs-growth-fund-contribute">statement</a> said the funding will help accelerate innovation in the clean energy industry after the Covid-19 slow-down.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has slowed down electrification in Africa, which was already behind before the health crisis. By increasing EEGF’s capacity to invest in this sector, FinDev Canada and its 2X Canada facility support energy companies committed to expanding access to clean and reliable energy for African households and businesses, leading to inclusive and sustainable growth and the improvement of millions of lives,” he said.</p>
<p>The fund invests in at least half of companies that explicitly address the energy needs of women consumers and entrepreneurs in Africa, and those offering renewable energy solutions to businesses and households. It is estimated that<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/06/18/figure-of-the-week-increasing-access-to-electricity-in-sub-saharan-africa/"> sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 75% of the world’s population</a> without access to electricity and renewable energy solutions could be taken-up to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>“A just and inclusive energy transition, one that alleviates energy poverty and mitigates climate change, requires an understanding of the financing needs of entrepreneurs, who we are depending on to deliver the world’s energy access goals,” said Shell Foundation’s operations director, Gareth Zahir-Bill.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“FinDev Canada’s investment into the fund will help it expand its provision of flexible financing solutions for entrepreneurs, accelerating access to clean and reliable energy for millions of lives in Africa.”</p>
<p>Last year the EEGF invested in Baobab+ and Yellow, both offering pay-to-own solar energy solutions, and Redavia, which designs and installs mobile solar farms for businesses.</p>
<p>Redavia, which has clients in Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania, received $3.7 million mezzanine investment from the fund. The startup targets to install more than 85 MWp of solar power across the continent. By September last year it had installed “close to 90 solar units, for 7 MWp of solar capacity.”</p>
<p>Yellow, which has operations in Malawi and Uganda and allows households and small businesses to pay for solar systems through installments, received $4 million, while Baobab+ got $2.3 million.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A congruence of factors in India — notably, climate change policies, fuel costs and skyrocketing demand for e-commerce — has set up ideal conditions for startups like all-electric commercial vehicle startup EVage.</p>
<p>The startup already has five EV trucks on the road for a range of e-commerce customers including Amazon India&#8217;s Delivery Service Partner, with plans to provide &#8220;in the thousands&#8221; more to Amazon by the end of the year, according to one investor. EVage just raised a $28 million seed round, led by new U.S.-based VC RedBlue Capital and will use the funds to complete its production-ready factory outside of Delhi in first quarter of 2022 and scale up production to meet growing demand.</p>
<p>EVage&#8217;s flagship vehicle is a one-tonne (2,000 pound) truck that was designed for India&#8217;s commercial delivery market using feedback from its partnership with Amazon. The truck is developed on EVage&#8217;s industry-ready EV platform that the company says allows it to build multiple different types of high quality vehicle at a far lower cost than other OEMs. The startup plans to manufacture vehicles in &#8220;Modular Micro Manufacturing&#8221; factories, similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/">Arrival&#8217;s microfactories</a>, which should have smaller carbon footprints and require less capital to produce vehicles than traditional OEMs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upshot: EVage aims to pass those savings onto customers.</p>
<p>Finding a way to make production cheaper is vital for scaling, and the opportunity and demand for scaling EVs in India is massive.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, whom Olaf Sakkers, general partner at RedBlue Capital and future EVage board member, says has had a high-level hand in the announcement of EVage&#8217;s deal with Amazon, has set a target for the country to have 30% private cars, 40% buses, 80% two and three-wheelers and 70% commercial vehicles electric by 2030.</p>
<p>A series of incentives like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &amp;) Electric Vehicles schemes (<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-extends-fame-scheme-to-promote-electric-mobility-till-2024-11624688932461.html">FAME-I and FAME-II)</a> help by providing subsidies to electric two-wheelers and commercial or transit-related four-wheelers. FAME-II subsidies only apply if OEMs source 50% of components from local manufacturers, which helps boost the supply side, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two and three-wheelers are already well on their way to that target, particularly so with companies like Ola Electric setting up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">massive factory for e-scooters</a> and Hero MotorCorp, one of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/">largest micro-EV manufacturers</a>, penning a deal with Taiwanese battery swapping company Gogoro to build a battery swapping network in India. Four-wheelers are a bit slower to market, in part because the average commuter isn&#8217;t buying electric cars. The path to electric four-wheeler adoption, therefore, is more likely to occur through commercial roads, Sakkers said.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s e-commerce market is exploding, especially as global companies increase their presence in the country and the mobile-first nation full of smartphone users gets extra comfortable with easy digital transactions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">Amazon has invested $6.5 billion</a> in India since it entered the country in 2013, and Walmart entered the South Asian nation through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">$16 billion acquisition</a> of the startup Flipkart. Those companies, alongside national and local delivery companies, are looking to partner with Indian OEMs that can meet the unique demands of an Indian market.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some electric vehicles that work in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, and you see companies like Rivian selling to logistics fleets for those use cases, but the needs of Indian logistics in an Indian market more broadly is very different,&#8221; Sakkers told TechCrunch. &#8220;It requires solving different problems, and so we see a pretty big opportunity to create custom-built vehicles for these kinds of use cases.</p>
<p>Sakkers noted that from a pure engineering perspective, for example, EVage&#8217;s vehicles don&#8217;t have to meet the same standards of the west in terms of being certified to drive at highway speeds, because rarely in India do vehicles go above 40 miles per hour. That means everything from motor requirements to battery size and types of materials you need to build are different, and potentially much cheaper, added Sakkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total cost of ownership savings for the customers is quite significant,&#8221; said Sakkers. &#8220;They&#8217;re not only doing this for optic reasons, they&#8217;re also doing it for pure economic reasons. In India, you can&#8217;t operate at certain times of day in cities if you produce a certain amount of emissions, so it also improves your ability to operate a logistics fleet if you&#8217;re operating electric vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many startups that fit into this mold so thats why we&#8217;re putting so much capital into EVage,&#8221; said Sakkers. &#8220;The demand for this segment of vehicles is half a million per year in India. Scaling production to the hundreds of thousands is going to be a challenge for the company, but also a huge opportunity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The House committee leading the investigation into the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol issued subpoenas to four major tech companies Thursday.</p>
<p>January 6 select committee chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) sent <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-subpoenas-social-media-companies-records-related-january-6th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letters</a> to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, Reddit and Twitter demanding for those companies to provide additional information on how those platforms were used to organize the day&#8217;s violent events.</p>
<p>In the announcement, the committee accused each company of hosting content related to planning the attack on the U.S. Capitol. &#8220;Meta platforms were reportedly used to share messages of hatred, violence, and incitement; to spread misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories around the election; and to coordinate or attempt to coordinate the Stop the Steal movement,&#8221; the committee stated, noting that it believes Facebook&#8217;s since-disbanded Civic Integrity team held information relevant to the investigation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257835" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As TechCrunch reported at the time, Facebook was a major hub of the Stop the Steal movement as the platform failed to control the spread of content denying the legitimate results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Facebook was also previously the organizing platform of choice for some extremist and militia-like organizations that went on to play a role in the Capitol attack,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/proud-boys-facebook-mcinnes/"> including the Proud Boys</a> and the Three Percenters.</p>

<p>The committee&#8217;s complaint with Reddit appears to be focused on r/The_Donald, a notorious subreddit that migrated to its own domain after being banned over hate speech in late January 2020. The committee also noted that YouTube was used to livestream the events and Twitter users &#8220;reportedly used the platform for communications regarding the planning and execution of the assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee first requested relevant records from <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-demands-records-related-january-6th-attack-social-media-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 different platforms</a> in August of last year, though that round of letter also demanded information from extremist-friendly sites including 4chan, 8kun, Gab, Parler and theDonald.win in addition to more traditional social media apps like Snapchat, Twitch and TikTok.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The committee is revisiting its previous demands from the four mainstream social platforms after those companies failed to provide sufficiently detailed information &#8220;despite repeated and specific requests,&#8221; this time with a deadline set for January 27.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A competition legal expert, backed by a powerful litigation fund, is set to mount a multibillion-dollar class action suit against Facebook/Meta for breach of competition law on the basis that it abused its dominance of social networking in the U.K. for several years. If successful, the action would see Facebook having to pay $3.1 billion (£2.3 billion) in damages to Facebook U.K. users.</p>
<p>The class action lawsuit was lodged against Meta, Facebook’s parent company, yesterday with the U.K.&#8217;s Competition Appeal Tribunal in London.</p>
<p>The unusual approach claims Facebook should pay its 44 million U.K. users compensation for the exploitation of their data between 2015 and 2019. Effectively, it’s saying Facebook took all the personal and private data of its users &#8212; who, due to Facebook’s dominance, had no other viable social platform &#8212; and in return all its users got, in effect, was the ability to post pictures of babies and kittens to their friends and families.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The action is being mounted by international competition law expert Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen (pictured above) who has made submissions before the U.K.’s Parliament regarding Facebook’s market dominance, as well as written <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3400204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">academic legal papers</a> about it.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s case rests on the idea that Facebook (recently renamed Meta) set an &#8220;unfair price&#8221; for U.K. Facebook users.</p>
<p>The “price” set for granting access to the social network was the surrender of U.K. users’ highly valuable personal data, who in return simply got “free” access to Facebook’s social networking platform, no financial compensation, all while Facebook generated billions in revenues.</p>
<p>Key to the case’s argument is that Facebook &#8220;surrounded&#8221; its U.K. users not just by locking them and their data into its platform, but also by tracking them via the Facebook pixel, on other websites, thus generating deep “social graph” data about its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Germain to Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s argument is that user profiles resurfaced time and again in controversies, such as during the Cambridge Analytica scandal, further illustrating their market exploitation.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen’s lawyers, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, LLP, have written to Meta to notify them of the claim. Dr Lovdahl Gormsen will represent the class of people affected &#8212; that is, all people domiciled in the U.K. who used Facebook at least once during 1 October 2015 &#8211; 31 December 2019.</p>
<p>The &#8220;opt-out&#8221; class action is the first of its kind against Meta in England and Wales. As an opt-out case, Facebook’s 4 million U.K. users will not need to actively join the case to seek damages, but will be part of the claim unless they decide to opt-out from it.</p>
<p>Financial backing for the case is coming from Innsworth, one of the largest litigation funders in the world. Quinn Emanuel and Innsworth have previous history in bringing consumer class action claims of this kind.</p>
<p>The wider context to this is that Meta is also facing a consumer class action in the U.S., regulatory action around the world and an antitrust suit from the FTC in the U.S. that could break it up from the Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dr Lovdahl Gormsen said: “In the 17 years since it was created, Facebook became the sole social network in the UK where you could be sure to connect with friends and family in one place. Yet, there was a dark side to Facebook; it abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons giving it the power to exploit their personal data. I&#8217;m launching this case to secure billions of pounds of damages for the 44 million Britons who had their data exploited by Facebook.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, I asked Dr Lovdahl Gormsen if Facebook could argue that there were other social networks available, such as Twitter or Myspace?</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think people can connect to their family and friends in the same way on Twitter, and Snapchat and all these other places. Facebook is quite unique in the way they&#8217;re doing it,” she said.</p>
<p>The action is also based on the ubiquity of the Facebook pixel on other websites. What is the significance of that to the case, I asked?</p>
<p>“Imagine yourself as a Facebook user,” said Dr Lovdahl Gormsen. “You may be aware that your data will be used by Facebook.com. But what the pixels are doing is when you use a third-party website, that of course has nothing to do with Facebook. That means Facebook has created many, many, many more data points on you that you actually knew you’d signed up to.”</p>
<p>She argues that although it’s possible for a user to remove themselves from Facebook’s platform, deep down in the Settings, in practice the vast majority of users have no idea how to do this or even know it’s possible.</p>
<p>Dr Lovdahl Gormsen is a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL), the director of the Competition Law Forum, a Non-Governmental Advisor to the International Competition Network and sits on the advisory board of the Journal of Antitrust Enforcement (OUP).</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Facebook asking for comment but had received no reply at the time of publication.</p>

<p>Investors are similarly betting there is plenty of upside in a hiring platform focused entirely on the fast-growing cannabis industry, in which an estimated <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/budtending-by-the-numbers-heres-where-the-jobs-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">320,000 people</a> were already working as of last fall, a 32% increase from the year earlier.</p>
<p>Indeed, an <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25037996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor syndicate</a> led by Level One Fund just plugged $19 million in Series B funding into <a href="https://vangst.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vangst</a>, a six-year-old, Denver-based outfit that pairs both short-term workers and full-time employees with job openings at cannabis companies around the U.S. It&#8217;s no surprise, given the traction the outfit is seeing, along with the variety of revenue streams it has built.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to founder and CEO Karson Humiston &#8212; who launched the company while an undergraduate student at St. Lawrence University &#8212; Vangst currently features 500 &#8220;gigs&#8221; per week that the platform takes on average 48 hours to fill. (Vangst treats these individuals as W-2 employees, and pays them through its own payroll.) It also right now features nearly 2,000 full-time positions that represent $85 million in gross salaries.</p>
<p>It can start to add up financially. Vangst charges its customers 50% more than it pays its part-time employees, so paying $15 per hour, it might charge a client $22.50 for that employee&#8217;s time. As for full-time roles, in exchange for vetting talent that it connects with companies, Vangst takes a percentage of each candidate&#8217;s first-year salary.</p>
<p>Vangst also charges employers both monthly and yearly subscriptions for the privilege of posting as many openings as they need to fill and, more recently, it began to build out a content business that includes modules about retail roles and other positions in the cannabis industry that those new to the industry might not understand. (Not everyone knows what a trimmer does.)</p>

<p>It hasn&#8217;t all been a bed of rosettes for Humiston and her team. Though Vangst had gained momentum following its Series A round, which closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/jobs-platform-vangst-just-raised-10-million-to-plug-more-people-into-the-fast-growing-cannabis-industry/">$10 million</a> in 2019, like a lot of other hiring businesses, it was hard hit by the immediate ripple effects of the coronavirus. In March of 2020, Humiston says, Vangst was forced to lay off half its then 70-person team as its customers shrank their own payrolls and began operating at 50% of their previous capacity.</p>
<p>In fact, it was because of Vangst&#8217;s dwindling revenue that it decided to jump into the business of placing full-time salaried candidates in roles. Think accounting managers, product managers and software engineers. &#8220;That was sort of our COVID strategy,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Gradually, when business bounced back, Vangst had built up an entirely new book of business, says Humiston.</p>
<p>Now the challenge is no longer demand but supply. Like nearly every other employer in the U.S., Vangst, which has 56 employees, is working hard to find people to fill the roles on its platform, including by attending trade shows and spending money on SEO services.</p>
<p>Part of its new funding round will be used to build up its small marketing team, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Vangst&#8217;s own customers are meanwhile having to sweeten their terms in many cases in order to secure help. As Humiston tells it, &#8220;We encourage them to pay above minimum wage&#8221; and to &#8220;show their mission and values and the perks that they offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The good news: Many more new jobs are expected to come online to fill, which should bode well for Vangst when the labor market finds its footing again.</p>
<p>The state of New York, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/new-york-marijuana-legalization-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legalized</a> recreational cannabis use last September, and though it is still in the process of doling out retail licenses, that decision is expected to open up <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9142719/Cuomo-says-legalizing-marijuana-create-60-000-jobs-300m-tax-revenue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60,000 new jobs</a>, according to former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>Last fall, New Jersey also signed into law three bills that permit and regulate the use of recreational marijuana, and businesses are already opening up there.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s saying nothing of Michigan, which is &#8220;growing extremely quickly right now&#8221; as a market, Humiston says. (Vangst also has clients in Colorado, California, Nevada and Arizona, among other places to have already embraced recreational marijuana. There are currently <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/where-is-marijuana-legal-a-guide-to-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18 states</a> altogether where it&#8217;s legal.)</p>
<p>Eventually, says Humiston, Vangst also hopes to go international. Toward that end, it has upcoming plans to spend time in Barcelona with one of its investors, Casa Verde Capital, which is investing more money in European startups these days.</p>
<p>The team has much to master first, she offers. &#8220;As here [in the U.S.], where we had to do a lot of learning about business needs and regulatory stuff, we&#8217;re eager to learn about international markets. We&#8217;re starting that exploration process this spring.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 13, 2022! Somehow it is already the close of Thursday, which is odd, as it was minutes ago Monday morning. Such is the pace of 2022! There is some hope in the market that things will slow down (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/dear-vcs-if-you-want-startup-prices-to-come-down-stop-paying-higher-prices/">and get cheaper</a>), but that doesn’t seem super likely at the moment. More on that shortly, along with news that Facebook’s dating app is kaput? To which we can heartily reply: Facebook is still building dating apps? – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/has-y-combinators-new-deal-changed-the-early-stage-investing-game/">How Y Combinator’s new terms are changing startup investing</a>: News that Y Combinator is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/">boosting the capital it invests</a> into its accelerator batch companies is driving a <em>little</em> bit of commentary. While Y Combinator investing more money is generally good news for startup founders, other investors have concerns.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/instacart-doubles-down-on-its-ready-made-meals-offering-with-new-hub-and-faster-delivery/">Instacart goes Blue Apron, because why not</a>: Instacart is rolling out pre-made meals to its platform, expanding its product remit as the grocery delivery game becomes increasingly competitive. Recall that Instacart had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">simply insanely good 2020</a>, but that growth at the well-funded former startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">slowed in 2021</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/databricks-launches-its-first-industry-specific-lakehouse/">Databricks does something other than file an S-1</a>: Databricks, a massive private data analytics firm, has released a verticalized version of its “Lakehouse” product. What’s a lakehouse? The thing that sits atop a data <em>lake, </em>get it? Anyways, flagging this moment for you as the point in which we really, <em>really</em> knew that Databricks was a Big Kid company and that it should go public. C’mon Databricks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">we want the damn numbers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>We have lots and lots to talk about today, so let’s dive right in:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/turnip-mobile-first-gaming-community-funding/">Turnip wants to power gaming communities</a>: I joke about startup names from time to time, but I really do adore the moniker “Turnip.” It’s memorable, fun to say, and the company even has a .gg domain name. Why the weird TLD? Because Turnip is in the gaming <em>community</em> space, and a .gg is to gamers as a .eth is to a person with a Middlingly Messy Minx as their profile picture on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/arc-wants-to-build-the-de-facto-finance-solution-for-saas-startups/">Arc shows there is more room in the market for alt-financing plays</a>: Fresh out of stealth, Arc is building a product to both provide capital access to software companies and perhaps help them manage other elements of their financial lives. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a> dug into the company’s plans.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/payment-orchestration-platform-gr4vy-pulls-in-another-15m-in-a-series-a-extension/">Gr4vy raises $15M for payments orchestration</a>: While I try to avoid buzzwords in this newsletter when possible, I took a moment today to better learn what “payments orchestration” is, as that’s what Gr4vy just raised a Series A extension to work on. In practice, it appears to be a meta software layer that bundles all sorts of payments options and work into a single product. So it’s more like a bundle than a conductor, but I have to admit that “orchestration” sounds better than, say, coordination.</li>
<li>Also shoutout to Gr4vy for flat-out using leetspeak in its name. Very retro.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/gofundme-acquires-classy/">GoFundMe buys Classy</a>: GoFundMe is perhaps best known as the U.S. healthcare and disaster safety net. Classy is a similar product, but aimed at helping nonprofits fundraise. The former has bought the latter in an equity deal, according to our own <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda Silberling</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/yahaha-studios-a-platform-for-building-no-code-immersive-games-raised-50m-in-3-rounds-ahead-of-its-launch-this-year/">What happens if you combine no-code, metaverse, games, user-generated content, $50 million, and Espoo</a>? You get Yahaha Studios, which is <em>based </em>in Espoo, Finland. It just announced that it has raised $50 million over three rounds and is building a no-code service that it calls a “metaverse for games.” Not only am I curious thanks to Roblox’s huge success, but I like games, so find this to be perfectly neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/pubg-mobile-maker-krafton-sues-apple-google-and-rival-game-developer-garena-over-clones/">PUBG publisher sues around $5T in market cap over game clones</a>: The publisher of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds mobile version, Krafton, is suing Apple (worth $3 trillion), Alphabet (worth a little less than $2 trillion), and Garena Online (valuation unknown) over what TechCrunch describes as copying its title’s “opening, its game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor and unique objects, locations, and the overall color schemes, materials and textures.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/ubits-snags-25m-to-create-the-netflix-for-corporate-training-in-latam/">UBITS raises $25M to upskill workers in LatAm</a>: The great edtech explosion of 2020 moderated somewhat in 2021, but now in 2022 we’re still seeing rounds get done in the space. UBITS is building tech to help “upskill” workers in Latin America, or essentially to train them for new, more complex work.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so, so much more. This startup thinks it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/u-s-fintech-current-introduces-high-yield-savings-where-customers-earn-a-4-00-apy/">can offer a 4% savings rate</a>, which is wild. This startup is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/">building super cute sidewalk robots</a>. Shield <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/shield-bags-15m-series-a-to-address-surging-demand-for-its-ai-powered-communication-compliance-platform/">raised $15 million</a> for communications compliance software, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/fintech-farm-nabs-7-4m-to-launch-neobanks-in-nigeria-and-other-emerging-markets/">while Fintech Farm wants to build neobanks for different emerging markets</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Setting up high-conversion lead magnets that deliver value</strong></h2>

<p>It’s one thing to get a prospective customer to visit your site, but convincing them to reach for their wallet or share their phone number is a stretch.</p>
<p>As consumers gain greater control over their privacy, Aleksandra Korczynska, CMO of GetResponse, says marketers who align lead generation with the goals of prospective customers will gain a significant advantage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets,” she says.</p>

I would not be shocked if deep inside the company’s headquarters there were a few developers frantically building an alpha version <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/">of a FriendFeed clone</a>, even if Bret Taylor already quit the company to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/">become a pseudo-CEO at Salesforce</a>.

Now if you hate gift wrapping, and hate giving away money, you can be doubly annoyed thanks to Venmo’s new feature that will let users ‘wrap’ their money transfers. Now your parents cannot claim that giving money instead of a present isn’t festive!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The creator of one of the earliest and most enduringly iconic virtual worlds is returning to his roots. Second Life&#8217;s founder Philip Rosedale will rejoin the company he founded in 1999 as a strategic advisor after <a href="https://www.highfidelity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High Fidelity</a>, the spatial audio company Rosedale co-founded in 2013, invested in Second Life&#8217;s developer Linden Lab. The deal includes an unspecified cash investment, relevant patents and some members of its development team.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has come close to building a virtual world like Second Life,&#8221; Rosedale said in a press release. &#8220;Big Tech giving away VR headsets and building a metaverse on their ad-driven, behavior-modification platforms isn’t going to create a magical, single digital utopia for everyone. Second Life has managed to create both a positive, enriching experience for its residents — with room for millions more to join — and built a thriving subscription-based business at the same time. Virtual worlds don’t need to be dystopias.&#8221;</p>
<p>As companies like Meta launch their own visions for the metaverse, Rosedale has remained a vocal critic of some of the dynamics that underpin the current era of online life, from ad-based social networks to the environmental impact of energy generated by <a href="https://twitter.com/philiprosedale/status/1359596124932198400?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin mining operations</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While few Roblox users are old enough to have more than a passing familiarity with Second Life, if that, Rosedale&#8217;s virtual social platform pioneered many of the concepts that have only very recently been hyped under the umbrella of the &#8220;metaverse.&#8221; Second Life explored notions of digital identity, virtual real estate, digital economies and online multiplayer ecosystems in the early 2000s, back when Facebook only existed to connect students at elite universities.</p>
<p>Rosedale is already regularly in communication with executive chairman of Linden Lab, Brad Oberwager, according to the company, but will significantly deepen his involvement in the platform&#8217;s product plans in the new advisory role. And High Fidelity&#8217;s current work remains extremely relevant to Second Life&#8217;s second life: A number of social platforms recently added spatial audio to create more immersive experiences, and some of them, like Clubhouse, are licensing High Fidelity&#8217;s code to pull it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Philip started Second Life in 1999, its visionary approach has not only stood the test of time, but positioned it for the future,&#8221; Oberwager said. &#8220;He and the High Fidelity team have unmatched experience and I can’t wait to capitalize on the vast opportunity in front of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Rosedale back in the fold, it sounds like Linden Lab is interested in tapping into that early mover magic. But Second Life has a long way to go to claw its way back to relevance. Fortnite-maker Epic, Roblox, Meta and myriad other major companies are betting big on a near future (or arguably the present, depending on who you ask) of virtual worlds populated by digital identities with endless lucrative virtual goods on offer. Rosedale&#8217;s own perspective isn&#8217;t likely to imitate the glimpses into the metaverse that some platforms offer now, so it will be interesting to see how someone who has been thinking about these issues for 20 years envisions the virtual worlds that companies are suddenly so keen on all of us moving into.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In more than two decades as an angel investor and early-stage company scout, I’ve met with hundreds of entrepreneurs seeking funds and sat through an equal number of slide deck pitches.</p>
<p>You could say I’ve seen it all. From my point of view as an angel investor and former entrepreneur, here are five essential factors I look for when considering my next investment.</p>
<h2>Offer a game-changer that stands out</h2>
<p>To attract the right angel investor, make sure to present a compelling technology or product offering that solves a critical customer problem. Be sure to showcase your unique competitive advantage — an incremental improvement over the competition is not a winning formula for attracting investment.</p>
<p>Include key market metrics such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/mind-the-gap-e-commerce-marketers-should-revise-their-tam-and-sam-estimates/">TAM, SAM and SOM</a>. TAM (total addressable market) is the total revenue possible if a product or service were to achieve 100% market share. TAM answers the question of who would theoretically buy your product or service. It describes the total revenues a company could make if it had an all-encompassing monopoly with total market share for its product or service.</p>
<p>The TAM for the non-alcoholic beverage category, among the many categories where I invest, takes in the total worldwide non-alcoholic beverage market, looks at all revenues from beverage purchases, imagines sales in all countries in the world, and assumes no competition except tap water. SAM (service addressable market) is the TAM segment within geographical reach that you can target with your products or services. Lastly, SOM would be the <em>share of the market</em> that a company could capture over time.</p>
<h2>Present solid financials</h2>
<p>When presenting to angels, it’s critical to show proof of concept, traction with regards product/service development, and revenues. Knowing your company’s financial condition and presenting your numbers to investors is paramount, as is making sure the past and current numbers you present are accurate.</p>
<p>Investors want to see top line, gross margin and net profit margin. Don’t be tempted to overstate or hide trouble spots; it’s a huge red flag that investors will see through, sinking your prospects of attaining investment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Founders have a tendency to peg a much higher valuation to their company in a good economy. Resist the temptation!							<cite>Marjorie Radlo-Zandi </cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Case in point: Two venture capital groups recently pulled out of a game-changing SaaS company investment because the founder radically inflated financials and misrepresented the product development stage.</p>
<p>Have a realistic five-year projection that includes profit and loss – a mid-level projection that isn’t too optimistic or too conservative is best. These financial projections give investors a look into the future of your business sales, cost of goods, operating expenses and bottom line income. They become a collection of estimations and forecasts that give a data-backed view of your company&#8217;s financial future.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>The U.S. International Trade Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/us-regulator-rules-that-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents/">ruled on January 6</a> that Google infringed Sonos’ patented innovations in wireless speaker technology. This may sound like an obscure legal ruling about a complicated fight over intellectual property. But it confirms a problem that threatens America&#8217;s innovation economy and its international economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>The problem? Intellectual property theft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Years ago, Big Tech companies like Google decided that they profit more by stealing smaller companies’ intellectual property than buying or licensing it. Google, Apple, Samsung and others &#8212; with cash reserves in the tens, even hundreds, of billions of dollars &#8212; do not sweat legal fees, court costs or even damages they might have to pay for this theft. Google has a reported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-tech-rivals-tap-cash-reserves-to-realize-cloud-ambitions-11640773806" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$142 billion</a> in cash in the bank. This is far beyond what most companies make in total annual profits.</p>
<p>Big Tech thus takes what it wants. It then uses scorched-earth litigation tactics to beat up on complaining IP owners. It drags out litigation over many years and imposes massive litigation costs on IP owners seeking justice. Many IP owners don’t even file a lawsuit. They know it is ruinous and self-defeating to try to protect what is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>Simply put, Big Tech benefits from stealing IP. The legal costs and potential damages, if ever issued after years of litigation, are paltry by comparison.</p>
<p>A few companies have fought back, and the results confirm this predatory infringement practice. The story of Google’s abuse of Sonos is one of the more telling ones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sonos is a classic American success story, and Google’s piracy of its technology is a tragedy. Sonos began as a disruptive startup in 2005 with its groundbreaking patented innovation in wireless speakers. It secured a licensing deal with Google in 2013, when Google agreed to make its music service, Google Play Music, work with Sonos speakers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Simply put, Big Tech benefits from stealing IP. The legal costs and potential damages, if ever issued after years of litigation, are paltry by comparison.							<cite>Adam Mossoff</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>But Google merely used this deal to gain access to Sonos’ technology. It soon began making its own devices with Sonos’ technology, including speakers and other audio equipment that competed directly with Sonos’ speakers and other products in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Google did not have Sonos’ development costs to cover, and it could subsidize its new products and services with its massive profits from its search engine business. Thus, Google undercut Sonos’ prices — a common commercial practice by patent pirates.</p>
<p>Sonos first attempted to negotiate a deal with Google, asking Google to simply pay for a license for the technologies it pirated from Sonos. Google held out for years, dragging out negotiations while its profits ballooned and Sonos lost more and more money. Seven years later, Sonos was left with no choice but to defend its rights in court. Sonos sued Google in 2020.</p>
<p>Sonos also sued Google at the International Trade Commission. This special court can move faster than regular courts in prohibiting infringing imports. But it can’t reward damages.</p>
<p>This past August, a judge at the International Trade Commission ruled that Google had indeed infringed five of Sonos&#8217; patents. Last week, the commission reaffirmed this decision. Google still calls Sonos’ claims “frivolous” and promises to keep fighting.</p>
<p>This is just one prominent example of Big Tech’s illicit use of other people’s patented technologies. It is so common it now has a name: predatory infringement. Legal scholars and policy wonks call it &#8220;efficient infringement.&#8221; In plain English, this is piracy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Big Tech has been attacking America&#8217;s patent system to further support its piracy. Google and other companies have spent millions over the years lobbying Congress and regulators to weaken and eliminate patents, rigging the system against innovators. For instance, they created the &#8220;patent troll&#8221; boogeyman to smear patent owners who sue them for infringement &#8212; as if the problem was not their own theft, but their victims&#8217; gall in fighting back.</p>
<p>Washington must act to protect the innovators and creators who rely on patents as a key driver of the U.S. innovation economy. Congress should reintroduce and enact the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3666/text#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20House%20(07%2F10%2F2019)&amp;text=To%20strengthen%20the%20position%20of,that%20grow%20the%20country's%20economy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">STRONGER Patents Act</a>. This law would bring balance back to the patent system by reforming some of the legal rules and institutions that Big Tech lobbied to create and that are key to its predatory infringement tactics practices.</p>
<p>Sonos’ legal victory over Google confirms what policy wonks and lawyers have been talking about for years: Big Tech’s predatory infringement is 21st-century piracy, and Sonos is just one of many victims. Washington can and should help end this piracy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quick blog here to update you on some pretty important movements in the market. Today, in a nasty day for stocks generally, shares of software and cloud companies took a pounding.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.51%, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC?qsearchterm=nasdaq%20composite">per CNBC data</a>. That&#8217;s a very bad day for a huge, critical category of publicly traded wealth. And then the Bessemer Cloud Index, our favorite method of tracking a more targeted basket of modern software concerns, tanked 5.45% during regular trading.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of deleted value in a single day. But because the declines come after the startup-critical index already endured sharp drops recently, it was insult to injury. Here&#8217;s the chart:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2257750" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257750" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2257750 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-4.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://ycharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YCharts</a></p></div></p>
<p>You need to glean two things from this collection of graphed data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software stocks have given back more than all their gains from late 2020, and have retreated more than 30% from recent highs. That&#8217;s pretty bad.</li>
<li>Software stocks remain richly valued and are worth far more than they were at the start of 2020, a period of time roughly two years ago. That&#8217;s pretty good.</li>
</ol>
<p>So things are not great, but also not terrible, for modren public software companies.</p>
<p>The issue that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/software-stocks-get-punched-in-the-face-again/">continues to track</a> is how quickly &#8212; if at all &#8212; the declines shown above <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">begin to trickle into startup valuations</a>. We&#8217;re seeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/unicorn-exits-augur-poorly-as-justworks-delays-ipo-citing-market-conditions/">some chop in the private-public market divide</a>, where IPOs and direct listings try to carry companies from one shore to the other. But in terms of sheer startup fundraising momentum, you wouldn&#8217;t know that revenue multiples are taking a huge cut on the public markets. For most startups, it&#8217;s still heady days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Against a backdrop of a pandemic that has shredded supply chains and gym memberships alike, it was mildly surreal to see professional-grade gym machine company <a href="https://www.gosportsart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SportsArt</a> launch a rowing machine that can pump energy back into the grid. Like a wind turbine or a solar panel, except powered by pecs, deltoids and trapeziuses.</p>
<p>The rower uses a micro-inverter that enables you to put your back into charging your phone, one stroke at a time. The company estimates that to fully charge a depleted iPhone will take about two hours of rowing. That wasn&#8217;t the example the company would have given, but for a hot minute, I was excited by using a low-battery phone as a motivator to get on an exercise machine. The handlebar grip has fingertip controls to increase the resistance on the rower and &#8212; as you might expect &#8212; the heavier the resistance, the more power you generate.</p>
<p>The company showed off its G260 rower at CES in Las Vegas last week, claiming that the machine converts around 74% of the energy you exert into usable electricity. I had a chance to talk with the company&#8217;s COO this week, to figure out why it makes sense to use human power to power things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257736" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In an hour of working out, you could kind of generate up to the same kind of consumption as your fridge &#8212; or about 220 watts per hour,&#8221; explains Carina Kuo, COO at SportsArt &#8212; but she admits that you&#8217;re not going to be rowing to charge your Tesla quite yet. Also, that isn&#8217;t quite the point: &#8220;A traditional treadmill consumes about one kilowatt per hour. The idea is that in addition to working out, you&#8217;re helping offset your power consumption of the workout.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a company, SportsArt has been around for 40+ years. It&#8217;s headquartered in Taiwan, with its U.S. operations based in Seattle. In addition, the company has offices in Germany and Switzerland, with 300 employees scattered around the world, and sales operations in 80 countries. It is primarily targeted at gyms and robust rehabilitation facilities, but is also evaluating the home market at the moment. In the shorter term, Kuo suggests that perhaps shared gyms for apartment buildings etc. are a better fit for the company</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in the fitness industry the gyms not being able to be open [due to COVID-19] definitely caused this huge uptick in residential sales. That&#8217;s an area where it can be really difficult to compete because a lot of times people are thinking about cheaper, but not necessarily looking at the quality. That&#8217;s not the area that we&#8217;re trying to compete in. We believe in quality,&#8221; Kuo explains, and says that the company still maintains exercise equipment that was sold 10-15 years ago, and is still going strong in gyms and medical contexts. &#8220;We believe in using the best components, and we cover everything with the best warranty in the industry. I do think being able to have that kind of differentiator in that market is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus on commercial machines means it makes slightly more sense for the machines to be power-generating rather than a rower that sits in the corner of your gym, unused, 95% of the time: With more substantial use, the machines can put a dent in the power bill at the gym.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying that we are going to go into residential &#8212; we&#8217;re trying to find where our sweet spots would be,&#8221; explains Kuo, eager to highlight the company&#8217;s green and recyclability credentials over the past 40 years. &#8220;It make a difference in gyms in particular, because they are able to have a message of sustainability.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fortnite is back on iOS &#8212; well, kind of. Through Nvidia&#8217;s streaming game service <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce Now</a>, mobile users on iOS and Android will be able to play a touch-control version of Fortnite through cloud gaming. Players can now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/fortnite-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register</a> to join the closed beta test for Fortnite&#8217;s new mobile work-around &#8212; you don&#8217;t need to have a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/#product-matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid account</a> to play, and paying won&#8217;t give you priority for getting off the waitlist. But if you want to play Fortnite on mobile for longer than an hour, you might be driven to upgrade.</p>
<p>Fortnite hasn&#8217;t been playable on iOS devices since August 2020, when it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/fortnite-app-store-removed-apple/">kicked off</a> the App Store for trying to skirt Apple&#8217;s 30% commission on in-app purchases. Then, Fortnite developer Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">sued</a> Apple, alleging that the tech company is a monopoly that violates antitrust laws. In September, the California court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruled</a> that Apple cannot prohibit developers from adding links for alternative payments outside the App Store. But Apple ultimately had the upper hand in the ruling: the court said the tech giant was not acting as a monopoly like Epic claimed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today’s ruling isn&#39;t a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers. <a href="https://t.co/cGTBxThnsP">https://t.co/cGTBxThnsP</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370670166945792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But neither Apple nor Epic was happy with the ruling, so both parties <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">appealed</a> it. Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">convinced</a> the appeals court to grant it more time before the injunction goes into effect. That means it didn&#8217;t have to make the court-ordered App Store changes dictated by the original ruling.</p>
<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has remained a vocal dissident of Apple, so it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/">up in the air</a> if we&#8217;d ever see a Fortnite iOS app any time soon, even if the two entities come to an agreement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">That the venture capital market is incredibly exuberant at the moment is not news. Data from 2021 paints the picture of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">a startup fundraising game at peak velocity</a>, with more capital, unicorns and nine-figure deals than ever.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, some venture capitalists are tired of it. PitchBook <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/VC-valuations-decrease-tech-stock-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a post up detailing</a> how startup prices are too high from the viewpoint of investors. That startup investment and resulting valuations may have gotten out of hand is not an unpopular perspective. Reuters&#8217; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/red-hot-startups-face-year-down-rounds-2021-12-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prediction series</a> for the new year included the idea that startups &#8220;seeking to raise capital in 2022 may [have] to sell shares at a lower valuation than before,&#8221; to flag another example.</p>
<p>But missing from the discussion of the prices that venture capitalists and other private-market investors are paying for startup shares is the fact that <em>they are still doing it.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257458" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This, of course, is a choice.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists have the ability to stop writing checks. They can hit the brakes &#8212; and quickly. We saw this in 2020 when, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">for several weeks while early-COVID uncertainty reigned</a>, venture capitalists around the world started to circle the wagons around their existing portfolio companies. So, it <em>is</em> possible for investors to just, well, <em>not</em> for a bit.</p>
<p>If a bunch of venture investors decided to effectively go on strike, it would have an impact. And that impact would be to lessen competition, perhaps leading to lower overall startup valuations in the near term.</p>
<p>Will that happen? <em>Hell no.</em> Venture capitalists are putting capital to work at revenue multiples that even they know are elevated past reason. They are doing so because they think it is the best move from where they currently sit in the market. The game here is pretty simple: Invest the current fund, enjoy paper markups from other investors, raise an even bigger fund, repeat until your AUM makes you feel important.</p>
<p>This is why the complaints &#8212; and I do not mean to single out any particular investor here; most are only content to whine while off the record, I&#8217;ve noticed, so points to investors saying out loud what others are thinking &#8212; are somewhat silly to me. It&#8217;s investors complaining about their own activity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2257460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="342" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg 704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alex-meme.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>For founders that can access more capital than ever at lower prices, godspeed. May you never find yourself in a valuation trap. But will I feel bad for the investing class? Never.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GoFundMe <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005248/en/GoFundMe-to-Acquire-Classy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that it will acquire Classy, a nonprofit fundraising software company. This is an all equity deal, though the company did not disclose the financials.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a GoFundMe, from a local food pantry to a community member in need. But Classy is more specialized, working directly with nonprofits. Since its 2010 seed round, Classy has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stayclassy-org/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$183.5 million</a> in venture capital, which most recently included a <a href="https://www.classy.org/blog/onward-future-of-fundraising-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$118 million Series D</a> in April 2021, led by Norwest Venture Partners. The Public Benefit Corporation employs a team of 200 and will become a subsidiary of GoFundMe, operating as a separate entity under GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we are proud of the combined $20 billion the GoFundMe and Classy communities have raised for people and organizations, we recognize the unique opportunity we have to make an even bigger impact — both in the U.S. and around the world — if we do this together,&#8221; Cadogan wrote in <a href="https://medium.com/gofundme-stories/how-gofundme-will-accelerate-progress-towards-our-vision-to-be-the-most-helpful-place-in-the-world-b1e60c95009e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257670" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cadogan hopes that the acquisition will help connect individual donors with nonprofit giving opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This could mean that someone who makes a donation to an individual seeking relief from a natural disaster, could then be connected to a nonprofit that focuses on addressing the underlying causes of climate change,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The company said that $5 billion was raised on GoFundMe and Classy combined in 2021. GoFundMe doesn&#8217;t charge a <a href="https://support.gofundme.com/hc/en-us/articles/203604424-Fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform fee</a> from fundraisers (aside from standard transaction fees), but when people donate to a campaign, they can add an optional tip that helps keep GoFundMe running. By default, the tip is set to 15% of the donation amount.</p>
