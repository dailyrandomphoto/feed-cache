										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ON this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://pod.link/found">Found</a>, we speak to Rob Schutz, co-founder and Chief Growth Officer at Ro. Ro recently raised $500 million, bringing its total raised to date to near $1 billion. The digital healthcare startup now does everything from telehealth primary care, to operating physical pharmacies, but it originally began life as Roman, a startup addressing men&#8217;s health, and specifically, erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Rob told us how a windy path from founding a daily deals site in the heady times of Groupon, to teaching at General Assembly, and being an early employee at Bark Box (now just &#8216;Bark&#8217;) led him to meeting up with co-founders Zachariah Reitano and Saman Rahmanian and setting up Roman in the first place. He also detailed how the company evolved, first to address women&#8217;s health as well, and eventually to providing much more broad-reaching remote primary care.</p>
<p>We talked about everything from managing the dynamics in a a founder triumvirate (including declarations of love), to dealing with the ongoing complications of a rebrand, to operating a business in an industry with dense regulatory requirements that vary considerably state to state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Rob, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Yes, developers are a tough crowd. They hate being sold to, and it’s pretty easy for traditional marketing campaigns to fall flat with them because they’d much rather get a recommendation from a colleague. Failed campaign after failed campaign has led many software company executives to throw up their hands and declare all sales and marketing to be pointless.</p>
<p>And that’s just wrong. Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult. I cover <em>why</em> it’s difficult and offer examples of exceptional developer-focused marketing in <a href="http://offers.openviewpartners.com/developerfocusedgtmplaybook">my new playbook</a>. Part of selling to developers involves balancing two things: building out a strong organic marketing function and targeting your audience with the right message at the right time throughout their buyer journey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Selling to developers isn’t impossible — it’s just difficult.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Easier said than done, right?</p>
<p>Yep. I see it all the time. Part of what’s blocking marketers from widening the top of the funnel (driving more developers to sign up for their free tools) for their developer-focused businesses is ensuring they have the right data and measurement capabilities in place to understand how much impact their activities have on the business.</p>
<p>That’s mostly because these marketers, community managers and developer relations experts have the most luck with organic marketing. In this industry, organic marketing is one of the most challenging to measure.</p>
<p>Organic marketing means investing in channels like referrals, organic search, organic social (community) and direct traffic to your website (brand). New users from paid marketing, banner ads, events or sales reps (the most measurable channels) don’t count as organic. We measure the fruits of these efforts with a new metric called <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/new-saas-metric/">Natural Rate of Growth</a>.</p>
<p>In a digital, multi-touch-point world, it’s getting more challenging to measure which users hear about your brand from which channels. That’s why tools like <a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, <a href="https://tribe.so/">Tribe</a> and <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty</a> have gained traction so quickly.</p>
<p>That’s all good, and it’ll be a huge boon for community managers in time, but these tools still don’t solve some of the core data strategy issues I see developer-focused software companies fighting. These quick tips should help your team align around what needs to be done and what&#8217;s just a “nice to have” so that selling to developers feels less like a battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat data like a product where a core end user is the go-to-market side of the team.</li>
<li>Map your customer’s journey from discovery to expansion and track it religiously.</li>
<li>Don’t overthink it.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LocoNav, a startup that is helping drivers and fleet owners in over two-dozen nations run their vehicles more efficiently and save money, said on Monday it has raised $37 million in a new financing round.</p>
<p>Five-year-old LocoNav&#8217;s new financing round, a Series B, was funded by Quiet Capital, Anthemis Group, Foundamental, Sequoia Capital India, RIT Capital Partners, Uncorrelated Ventures, Village Global and others. The new financing round brings the to-date raise of LocoNav, which has offices in San Francisco and Gurgaon, to $47 million.</p>
<p>Scores of high-profile tech executives including Anjali Joshi (ex-VP of Product at Google), Anand Chandrasekaran (ex-CPO at SnapDeal and ex-Director Facebook), Manik Gupta (ex-CPO at Uber), Jai Shekhawat, Mark Licht, Akhil Paul, Vas Bhandarkar, Ajay Agarwal (Partner at Bain Capital Ventures), Abhi Ingle (COO at Qualtrics), Aadil Mamujee also participated in the new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over half a million vehicle and fleet owners in 25 nations use LocoNav’s platform today that uses AI to help them manage their fleet operations, keep a watch on performance, and improve efficiency, the startup’s founders Shridhar Gupta and Vidit Jain told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>The startup’s platform delivers assistance and recommendations to drivers to make better choices. <a href="https://loconav.com">LocoNav</a> also enables customers to track fuel usage, and any potential theft. Its platform supports over a thousand devices and sensors, enabling it onboard new customers very quickly.</p>
<p>The founders said that the market in which they operate has become very large over the past decade as many drivers and fleet owners begin to engage with tech platforms. Some of the players operating in this space include unicorns and decacorns Fleetcor, Trimble, and A16z-backed Samsara.</p>
<p>But these players are largely operating in developed markets, which has allowed LocoNav to win customers in emerging nations, the founders said. “In global developing markets, no one has ambitiously built a large player and we see ourselves as the first mover there,” said Gupta. The founders added that the biggest roadblock in the industry remains drivers and fleet owners who are not using any tech.</p>
<p>“LocoNav has built an end-to-end product that becomes deeply embedded in how fleet owners and operators run their business. As a result, LocoNav has been able to scale rapidly through word of mouth, allowing the company to become a hyper growth market leader while also being very capital efficient,” said David Greenbaum, Partner at Quiet Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>By having such deep visibility into a vehicle, LocoNav has also become very attractive to a range of firms &#8212; from app-based cab aggregators, car vendors to fintech startups and sensor manufacturers, said Jain. The startup is also using its data insights to develop customer-relevant services and bringing them to a single platform, he added.</p>
<p>LocoNav plans to deploy the fresh capital to hire data science teams across San Francisco, Gurgaon and Bangalore. In the next two years, the startup aims to broaden its product offerings to help fleet owners cut their costs by up to 50%, the founders said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shridhar and Vidit have found the ideal playbook for delivering world-class value-added services and products to fleet owners across the globe through the use of AI and software solutions. We are thrilled at how rapidly the firm has been able to expand its global footprint by replicating its own model and suite of offerings for fleet owners,&#8221; said Shubhankar Bhattacharya, General Partner at Foundamental, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung’s Mobile World Congress presser was, once again, all about wearables. The big news at this evening’s (or afternoon’s, timezone dependent) event was <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/&amp;reserved=0">our best look yet at a redesigned interface</a> for the company’s line of Galaxy Watches.</p>
<p>One UI Watch – which takes its name from the Galaxy mobile interface &#8212; will share a design language with the one found on the company’s line of Galaxy phones. The upcoming One UI Watch will debut at an upcoming Unpacked event later this summer, sporting the new UI, as well as the forthcoming joint Samsung/Google platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170930" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170930" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-Seamless-Experience.2021-06-28-11_56_37.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/"> first teased at I/O last month</a> that the two technology powerhouses would be teaming up on a wearables project. We still have little in the way of information about it, however, – including what it will actually be called.</p>
<p>The partnership was initially announced as a “unified platform” that would allow developers to create a single app for both Google’s Wear OS and Tizen, the open-source operating system Samsung has long relied on for its own smartwatches. As we noted at the time, third-party app development has proven a considerable hurdle for both companies as they look to take on Apple’s dominance of the space.</p>
<p>Among the benefits of the partnerships is that once a watch-compatible app has been downloaded on a connected smartphone, it will also be downloaded to the app. Along with first-party Google apps like Maps and YouTube Music, the list includes Spotify (naturally), Calm, Strava, Adidas Running and Sleep Cycle.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/New-Unified-Platform-One-UI-Watch-App-Ecosystem.2021-06-28-11_55_13.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung/Google</p></div></p>
<p>“Samsung and Google have a long history of collaboration, and whenever we’ve worked together, the experience for our consumers has been dramatically better for everyone,” Google SVP Sameer Samat said in a release tied to the news. “That certainly holds true for this new, unified platform, which will be rolling out for the first time on Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch. In collaboration with Samsung, we’re thrilled to bring longer battery life, faster performance, and a wide range of apps, including many from Google to a whole new wearable experience.”</p>
<p>Such a partnership seems odd at first blush – Samsung long ago eschewed Google’s wearable operating system in favor of its own heavily customized version of Tizen. Ultimately, however, it seems the two are united against the monolith that is Apple – which currently enjoys somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of the global market. Samsung is in second, but even with Fitbit under its wing, Google’s still got a ways to go.</p>
<p>Samsung will also be showing off improved development tools that make it easier to create things like watch faces for the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today released the first preview build of Windows 11 to those in the Dev Channel of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/">Windows Insider</a> program. If you have joined the Insider program and meet Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">new &#8212; and somewhat complicated &#8212; system requirements</a> for the new operating system, you should see the update soon.</p>
<p>This first preview includes most of the new features Microsoft has promised for Windows 11, including the new look and feel, themes, widgets, the new snap layouts and the updated File Explorer. But there are also some features that didn&#8217;t yet make the cut for this first release. Support for Android apps and the new built-in Teams integration, for example, are coming in a later release, but a preview of the new Windows Store is already available today.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7y1S3wIysg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Otherwise, though, you&#8217;ll get to try out the new Start menu for example (and fret not, you will be able to move the start button to the bottom-left if you don&#8217;t like the centered look &#8212; but you won&#8217;t be able to move the entire taskbar to another side of the screen). And while the Start menu is an iconic part of the Windows experience, most power users probably never use it and instead use their keyboard or the taskbar to start 99% of their applications. Still, Microsoft is trying to do something different here with its new &#8220;recommended&#8221; section that highlights newly installed apps and recently used files.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170667" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170667" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170667" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg" alt="windows 11 file explorer" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_file_explorer.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170667" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature you&#8217;ll likely spot right away is the new File Explorer, which now does away with the ribbon-style menu in favor of a flatter look (Microsoft calls it a &#8216;command bar&#8217;) and new, more modern icons across the board. It looks good, but we&#8217;ll have to give it a try to see if it hasn&#8217;t lost a lot of functionality in the process.</p>
<p>The File Explorer, just like every other app in WIndows 11, will also feature support for Microsoft&#8217;s new Snap layouts, which take the existing &#8216;snapping&#8217; gesture or keyboard shortcuts in Windows that let you snap windows to any side of the screen and brings it to the maximize button. While the overall functionality isn&#8217;t new here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that a lot of Windows users never knew it existed, so this new feature will introduce window snapping to a lot more users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170668" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170668" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg" alt="Windows 11 widgets" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg 1531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173231.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The new widgets, too, are now prominently highlighted in the taskbar. Right now, there are calendar, weather, local traffic, Microsoft To Do and stocks widgets, as well widgets that show you recent photos from OneDrive and sports and esports news if that&#8217;s your thing. There&#8217;s also a personalized news feed.</p>
<p>The last new feature worth mentioning here is the new Settings menu. Ever since the ill-fated Windows 8, Windows essentially had two settings menus (the Control Panel and Settings). It looks like those confusing days aren&#8217;t over just yet, but the new Settings menu at least looks a lot cleaner than the existing one in Windows 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2170669" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg" alt="windows 11 settings" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-26-173522.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of other changes in Windows 11. This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes. Now we&#8217;ll just have to see how all of this works in the real world &#8212; though keep in mind that this is still an early release. The preview is now rolling out to Insiders, so we&#8217;ll likely hear more about how it performs soon. We&#8217;ll also put it through its paces in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The math is simple: Great research universities beget great startups. Pittsburgh certainly has little want for the former, with two world-class research schools &#8212; Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh – located in the city.</p>
<p>The latter historically presented a challenge for Pittsburgh, as local startups often left for the greener (in the sense of dollars) pastures of vibrant ecosystems like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">speaking to current mayor Bill Peduto</a> about how Pittsburgh is working to build its own startup community, I hopped on a call with Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of CMU’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. The Center – named for Accel founder Jim Swartz – is tasked with helping grow the student body’s entrepreneurial ambitions.</p>
<p>This interview is part of TechCrunch’s City Spotlight on Pittsburgh. Join us on Tuesday, June 29 for the free online event where we will be joined by Mayor Peduto, Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo, and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Can you give me a bit of a brief history on how CMU has developed startups over the years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dave Mawhinney</strong>: First of all, I’m a CMU alum – and I’m not your typical academic. I had a 30-year entrepreneurial and venture capital career before I came back to Carnegie Mellon a decade ago to make it on-par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities[…] When I came back to CMU in 2011, 2012, there were several different activities across campus that were rather siloed.</p>
<p>There was an effort in the computer science department, there was an effort in the engineering department, there was an effort in the business school and they were all doing their own things and not necessarily getting the economies of scale of working together. When the university asked me to come back and run the Don Jones Center at the business school, I said I would only do so if you give me the agency to try to pull together all of our entrepreneurial activities under one rough.</p>
<p><strong>You can create a really breakthrough technology, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got the ability to market it yourself to create an effective business plan. How much is that built into the curriculum at CMU? And how much cross pollination is there between the various departments?</strong></p>
<p>We have a sign at our front door that says, “the ideal startup team is hacker, hustler, designer.” The hackers are the technical people, the hustlers are the people that are willing to do business, to talk to partners. And I think designers are absolutely key because they are the glue that holds everything together. They make the products and services useable. It’s truly in our DNA and as we do our education in the four-credit classes, or as we do our workshops that are outside the classroom, that concept of design thinking, really getting to know your customer and solving real world problems that they’re willing to pay for now, is critical to getting the company off to the right start.</p>
<p>We also very much believe in the model of mentorship, so all of our startups get assigned mentors that are from the generalized background of the business that they’re going into. And then we have a roster of several hundred experts, from legal experts, accounting experts, marketing experts, manufacturing experts &#8212; any type of expertise that you can imagine that our teams can reach out to and tap into, to get questions answered and to get set on the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of vetting happens on the university side? Does a startup have to pass a certain threshold to gain access to all of these opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>Everybody’s welcome. Our doors are open to everybody, but there are some steps. When you come and sign up to work at the Swartz Center, you get to go to a first come, first serve table. There’s typically 20 of these tables available at any given time. The teams that show dedication, they participate in our programs, they’re showing up on a daily and weekly basis and they’re making progress, they’ll get a dedicated table, where they get to put their branding on the table and keep their equipment there. And the, ultimately, the teams that are making the most progress have customers and perhaps have raised a pre-seed or seed round, they get their own office. We have ten of those called “Startup Garages.” We do have that bit of meritocracy built in, as you go forward, but it is open to everybody. The truth is the founding teams, the entrepreneurs, they have to make it happen. We’re not going to spoon feed you.</p>
<p><strong>Like a lot of other schools located outside of major metropolitan areas, I assume there’s a lot of bleed when it comes to leaving for different markets.</strong></p>
<p>That has been true historically, but it’s changed. Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees. Every major tech company &#8212; Amazon, Facebook, Apple &#8212; have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon – and that sort of set off the robot revolution […] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.</p>
<p>But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community. If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora – collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million. So we do need to keep that connectivity to the money centers in the Bay Area and New York to ensure that our startups will get funded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer spending in mobile apps hit a record $64.9 billion during the first half of 2021, according to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-1h-2021">preliminary data</a> from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower. This figure represents a 24.8% increase in spending seen across both the App Store and Google Play, compared with the year-ago period. But while industry experts believe the accelerated shift to mobile fueled by the pandemic is a trend that will continue, it&#8217;s worth noting that &#8212; despite the new record &#8212; the growth rate for consumer spending has slightly slowed, and the download growth slowed more dramatically.</p>
<p>From the first half of 2019 to the first half of 2020, consumer spending on mobile apps grew 28.4% from $40.5 billion to $52 billion, for comparison &#8212; slower than the 24.8% seen in the current period.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170935" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170935" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-revenue-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store accounted for $41.5 billion in global consumer spending during the first half of 2021, or 1.8x the $23.4 billion seen by Google Play.</p>
<p>However, Google Play continues to outpace on growth, having jumped 30% from the $18 billion in the first half of 2020 compared with the 22.1% growth from the $34 billion the App Store had seen. This is due, in part, to demand from markets like the Philippines, where the Covid-19 pandemic has forced business closures and quarantines, Sensor Tower noted.</p>
<p>Consumer spend outside of games was driven by sports, finance, business, book and entertainment apps. Subscription-based apps in the top 100 apps (excluding games) were a large part of this spend, too, contributing $8.3 billion during the period. TikTok remained a top grossing app during the first half of 2021, followed by YouTube and regular top earner Tinder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170936" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170936" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-top-app-revenue-chart.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, mobile game spending continues to contribute to the largest part of the overall consumer spend, reaching $44.7 billion during the first half of the year. The App Store accounted for $26 billion of that figure, but growth slowed from 26.5% in the year-ago period to 13.5% from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>Top grossing games in the first half of 2021 were, in order, Tencent&#8217;s Honor of Kings ($15B+), PUBG Mobile (including its localized version for China, reached nearly $1.5B), Genshin Impact ($848M+), Roblox and Coin Master.</p>
<p>Mobile app download growth also significantly slowed in the first half of this year, the firm found.</p>
<p>Last year, the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to a surge of new mobile app installs around the world, as consumer looked to apps for work, school, shopping, heath, grocery, and more. During the first half of 2020, app installs had jumped 25.7% year-over-year to reach 71.3 billion downloads. But in the first half of 2021, downloads only grew 1.7% to reach 72.5 billion installs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2170940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png 1750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1h-2021-app-downloads-worldwide.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The App Store even saw a year-over-year decline in non-game installs in the first half of 2021, dropping 10.9% to 16.3 billion from 18.3 billion in the first half of 2020. Sensor Tower believes this is reflective of the increased competition for consumer attention in markets with a high number of iOS users, like the U.S., where businesses have been reopening and in-person activities are resuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google Play (non-game) installs climbed 6% in the first half of this year to 56.2 billion from the 53 billion in the first half of 2020. This could be tied to the demand for apps in markets where Android is dominant, like India, which has continued to be impacted by the pandemic. As a result, app adoption on Google Play was 3.5 times higher than on the App Store during the first half of 2021.</p>

<p>The (non-game) app with the most downloads was TikTok, which gained 384.6 million new installs during the first half of this year. But this is down by around 38% from the 619 million installs it saw during the year-ago period &#8212; a change that can be attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">its ban from the Indian market</a> last year. The rest of the top 5 most-downloaded app chart was dominated by Facebook, which scored the No. 2, No. 3, and No 4 positions, with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively. Telegram was No. 5 followed by Messenger, Zoom, Snapchat, CapCut and Google Meet.</p>
<p>Mobile game downloads, meanwhile, fell 22.8% to 4.4 billion on the App Store but grew 3.9% on Google Play to 23.7 billion in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>The app data presented is a preliminary analysis that may become more precise over time. It&#8217;s also worth comparing it to related reports from other firms for a fuller picture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-city-spotlight/">TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh</a> event tomorrow, I spoke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">to current Mayor Bill Peduto</a> and Dave Mawhinney, the executive director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship. Like many in the Steel City startup community, both share a focus on the historically difficult task of keeping startups in town.</p>
<p>For more on investing in Pittsburgh, be sure to tune in to our City Spotlight on Tuesday, June 29, where we will be joined by Peduto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">Duolingo</a> director of engineering Karin Tsai and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>
<p>I asked Peduto and Mawhinney what the single biggest obstacle has been in building out Pittsburgh’s startup ecosystem. Both responded the same way: venture capital. Raising funding is, of course, a hurdle regardless of location, but many VCs have been reluctant to invest in startups outside of traditional hubs like San Francisco and New York.</p>
<p>“But one of the challenges is getting that capital to come into the community,” said Mawhinney, who leads CMU’s startup efforts. “If you look at how much Uber ATG brought in, how much Argo AI and Aurora &#8212; collectively, those three companies, which have all licensed CMU technologies, they’ve all got over $7 billion in collective capital. Not all of it will be spent here, but a lot of it will be spent here. But that doesn’t necessarily trickle down to the next AI startup raising their first $3 million.”</p>

<p>Peduto said growing the VC pipeline has been a focus during his time as mayor.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told TechCrunch. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sideinc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, has raised “$50 million-plus” in a funding round that more than doubles its valuation to $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/side-raises-150m-at-1b-valuation-to-help-real-estate-agents-go-it-alone/">just three months after the San Francisco-based startup raised $150 million in a Series D funding round</a> led by Coatue Management at a $1 billion valuation. Tiger Global Management led the latest investment, which also included participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ICONIQ Capital and D1 Capital Partners. With the latest capital infusion, Side’s total raised since its 2017 inception now totals over $250 million. Matrix Partners, Sapphire Ventures, Trinity Ventures and 8VC led its earlier rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side says that it is now “backed by the three top technology initial public offering (IPO) underwriters” and that the latest funding “sets the stage for a future IPO.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup pulled in between &#8220;$30 million and $50 million in revenue&#8221; in 2020 (a wide range, we know), and expects to double revenue this year. In 2019, Side represented over $5 billion in annual home sales across all of its partners. Today, the company’s community of agent partners represents over $15 billion in annual production volum</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s predicting that by the end of 2021, it will have closed over $20 billion in home sales, positioning the company “as a top 10 national brokerage by volume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Side supports more than 1,800 partner agents across California, Texas and Florida. It says it’s seen a 200% year-over-year increase in agent-represented home sales across its three operating markets of California, Texas and Florida. The company plans to enter 15 new states by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guy Gal, Edward Wu and Hilary Saunders founded Side on the premise that most real estate agents are “underserved and under-appreciated” by traditional brokerage models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Gal said existing brokerages are designed to support “average” agents and, as such, the top-producing agents end up having to do “all of the heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side’s white label model works with agents and teams by exclusively marketing their boutique brand, while also providing the required technology and support needed on the back end. The goal is to help partner agents “predictably grow” their businesses and improve their productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way to think about Side is the way you think about what Shopify does for e-commerce […] When partnering with Side, top-producing agents, teams and independent brokerages, for the first time in history, gain full ownership of their own brand and business without having to operate a brokerage,” Gal told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “When you spend years solving the problems of this very specific community of agents, you are able to use software to drive enormous efficiency for them in a way that has never been done before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing brokerages, he argues, actively discourage agents from becoming top producers and teams, because agents who serve fewer clients can be forced into paying much higher commission fees on every transaction, which means the incentives between brokerages and top agents and teams are misaligned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Top producers want to grow and differentiate, and brokerages want them to do less business at higher fees and be one more of the same under the same brand,” Gal said. “Side, rather than discouraging and competing with top-producing agents and teams, enables them to grow and scale their own business and brand.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With less than a month to go before the Olympics kick off in Tokyo, cord-cutting services like YouTube TV are attempting to woo new subscribers who are looking for a way to watch summer sports. But whether or not you&#8217;re eager to watch Simone Biles defy gravity, YouTube TV&#8217;s latest upgrades enhance the product with audio and video improvements.</p>
<p>Today, YouTube TV announced a 4K Plus add-on package with offline downloads, 5.1 Dolby audio, and features that make it easier to watch live sports. The company previously <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">teased these features</a> in February.</p>
<p>YouTube TV is already one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">the pricier streaming services</a> out there &#8212; at $64.99 per month, you might not save much money by choosing YouTube in lieu of your cable service. Hulu + Live TV is priced the same, but offers a Disney+ and ESPN+ add-on for a total of $72.99 per month. But if you want to kick your video quality (and your monthly bill) up a notch, you can now enable 4K streaming for an extra $19.99 per month, bringing your grand total to $84.98 monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 4K Plus add-on package will also allow subscribers to download shows from DVR to watch offline &#8212; currently, that&#8217;s not possible on the standard $64.99 per month package. Subscribers will be able to try out the package for free for a month, then pay $9.99 per month for a year before the price increases to $19.99. This is pretty consistent with YouTube TV&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/youtube-tv-gets-some-new-channels-and-a-hefty-price-hike/">continual price hikes</a> over the years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities will be a free addition for all YouTube TV members &#8212; in a blog post, the company says this has been one of users&#8217; &#8220;biggest requests.&#8221; Over the coming weeks, these surround-sound audio capabilities will begin rolling out to select devices.</p>
<p>The sports upgrades also come at no additional cost &#8212; one new feature will let viewers jump to key plays and specific highlight moments when watching a DVR recording or trying to catch up live. So, if you&#8217;re tuning in an hour late, you can view key moments from the game, then jump right in live. YouTube TV will also let users search for specific sports to add to their DVR, which has no storage space limit. So, again, if you&#8217;re determined not to miss a single Simone Biles floor routine, it will be easier to make sure you&#8217;re in the loop. There will also be a Medal count view during the Olympics within the app.</p>
<p>As the Olympics draw nearer, we can expect other cord-cutting services to up the ante on their live sports offerings &#8212; the $9.99 monthly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">Paramount+ Premium plan</a> includes a wide range of international soccer matches, but no word on the Olympics yet. Still, the service is far less expensive than YouTube TV and already offers 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision. YouTube TV had<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-roku-face-off-youtube-tv-added-to-main-app-free-streaming-devices/"> 3 million subscribers</a> as of October 2020, but did not offer an update for Q1 of 2021. As of March, Hulu had <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/hulu-statistics/">4.1 million subscribers</a> to its Live TV service, which will also air the Olympics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> co-founder Dennis Crowley has <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">announced</a> that he is stepping back from his full-time role at the company. During the first seven years of the company, he was the startup’s Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, Crowley moved to an executive chairman position. He’s also been running the <a href="https://foursquare.com/labs/">Foursquare Labs</a> R&amp;D group since then.</p>
<p>Going forward, Crowley won’t be working full-time at the company. He’ll remain on the Board of Directors as co-chair <a href="https://foursquare.com/article/foursquares-dennis-crowley-and-gil-elbaz-shifting-to-board-of-directors-full/">with Factual founder Gil Elbaz</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vmq9xN72It"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/">Foursquare merges with Factual</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Foursquare merges with Factual&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/embed/#?secret=Vmq9xN72It" data-secret="Vmq9xN72It" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2009, Foursquare was better known for its location-based social network. People would check in to locations to share what they’ve been up to with their friends. Users would earn badges and mayorships.</p>
<p>Over the years, the most active users had amassed thousands of checkins. Foursquare became a great app to keep track of places you like. You could also use it to discover your friends’ favorite places.</p>
<p>That’s why the company decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/foursquare-splits-into-two-apps-but-will-either-be-strong-enough-to-survive/">split</a> its main app into two separate apps — the Foursquare City Guide and Swarm. At the same time, the company started working on developer APIs and SDKs so that other companies could take advantage of Foursquare’s location data.</p>
<p>That business in particular has been quite lucrative. With the company’s <a href="https://foursquare.com/products/pilgrim-sdk/">Pilgrim SDK</a>, developers can build location-aware apps. For instance, an advertiser can send a personalized notification based on where you are. Foursquare tries to be as accurate as possible and can sometimes even figure out when you enter or exit a venue.</p>
<p>That SDK enables many different possibilities. It’s easy to track the impact of an advertising campaign on online sales, but what about offline interest?</p>
<p>Foursquare’s SDK can help advertisers and brands see whether an advertising campaign has an impact on foot traffic. Of course, you can also combine that data with other customer data.</p>
<p>The company has become an important advertising and marketing platform focused on location. Overall, the company has generated more than $100 million in revenue in 2020. And it plans to grow in 2021 and beat that number.</p>
<p>Crowley mentions two reasons why he’s leaving now. According to him, the company is doing well, and he’s been working on the same thing for 12 years already.</p>
<p>“Foursquare hasn’t just found its way… it leads the way. I used to say that my goal was to make the name ‘Foursquare’ synonymous with ‘innovation in contextual aware computing’… And, here in 2021, we’ve built the tools and frameworks that can make that so,” Crowley writes in a <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>“Also, 12 years is a lot of time. I have lots of things I still want to build — many of which don’t fit neatly into the Foursquare of 2021 (and, hey fellow founder, it’s fine to feel this way!),” he adds. He&#8217;s also going to spend some well-deserved time with his family.</p>
<p>Crowley has been an iconic startup founder during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era. He managed to attract tens of millions of users. It’s clear that he’s been a great product CEO during the early years of the company. And now, the company is <em>also</em> generating revenue. So it’s going to be interesting to see what he builds next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Armstrong, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt this September 21-23</a>, and given how much there is to discuss, we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to host him.</p>
<p>As some industry observers will know, Armstrong, a native of San Jose, Calif., whose parents were both engineers, nabbed two degrees from Rice University in Texas before joining Airbnb as a software engineer in 2011 as a technical product manager focused on fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The role gave him the opportunity to learn about payment systems &#8212; and payment problems &#8212; across the world. It relatedly fueled a then-burgeoning interest in cryptocoins, which he began to buy and store and, more important, he began to believe would ultimately replace fiat money. In fact, after just 14 months with Airbnb, Armstrong left the company to join Y Combinator and found Coinbase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t focused on making money, by his telling. Instead, as he told Forbes last year, &#8220;I wanted the world to have a global, open financial system that drove innovation and freedom.” Either way, along the way, Armstrong became very wealthy, as have many Coinbase employees and investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, which built the biggest stake in Coinbase over the years and whose position was valued at a reported $11 billion at the time of Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing this past April.</p>
<p>Still, the success of Coinbase &#8212; which has established itself as <em>the</em> clean, well-lit place to invest in cryptocurrencies &#8212; has also invariably led to greater scrutiny. The company has been widely accused by its customers of focusing on security at the expense of adequate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/coinbase-commits-to-a-better-customer-experience-following-complaints/">customer service</a>. Several of Armstrong&#8217;s managerial decisions, including to clamp down on <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">political speech</a> inside of Coinbase, has cost the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">valued employees</a>, while others have said they were treated unfairly because of their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/coinbase-pay-employees.html">race or gender</a>.</p>
<p>More, following a very long run, enthusiasm over cryptocurrencies has abruptly slowed over the last month or so. While Armstrong has seen enthusiasm for crypto grow and wane before, Coinbase is now a publicly traded company, and as questions bubble up about Bitcoin, Coinbase&#8217;s shares are down, too. (As of this writing, they are trading at around $217, almost half of where they were valued at their peak price in April of about $429.)</p>
<p>Little wonder Armstrong has been laser-focused on not only strengthening what Coinbase has already built but setting it up to become an even larger enterprise, including by <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-acquire-leading-blockchain-infrastructure-platform-bison-trails-f879654421d6">acquiring a company</a> early this year that positions Coinbase to operate as a kind of AWS, enabling companies that, say, want to connect their wallet app to a blockchain to click a few buttons rather than hire a team of engineers to spin up the necessary nodes.</p>
<p>How else is Armstrong, 38, dealing with the market&#8217;s ups and downs as he builds a completely new financial institution? Where does he want to take Coinbase over the next 12 months? How does he respond to criticisms about some of his very public decisions concerning Coinbase employees? These are among the many things we&#8217;ll talk with him about at this year&#8217;s Disrupt for an appearance that we know attendees won&#8217;t want to miss. We&#8217;re certainly excited to sit down with him.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The cybersecurity unicorn raised its IPO price range today. As a heat check on the larger IPO market, it's a thermometer about to explode. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the second quarter races to a close, we&#8217;re down to the wire for IPOs looking to get out before June ends. One such company is SentinelOne, a cybersecurity startup backed by Insight Venture Partners, Redpoint, Tiger Global Management, Data Collective and Anchorage Capital, among others.</p>
<p>SentinelOne raised an ocean of capital while private, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sentinel/company_financials">nearly $500 million across two rounds in 2020</a>. Its debut is therefore a huge liquidity event for a host of investing groups. And today, the cybersecurity unicorn had good news in the form of an upgrade to its IPO price range.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/">The Exchange wrote that</a> the company&#8217;s IPO would be a &#8220;good heat check for the IPO market&#8221; given its rapid growth and pace of losses. How investors valued it would help explain the public market&#8217;s current appetite for loss-making startups. Today&#8217;s news implies healthy appetites.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995211 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>SentinelOne raised its IPO price range this morning from $26 to $29 per share to $31 to $32 per share, a sizable lift to its valuation and IPO raise.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re unpacking the company&#8217;s new valuation range, thinking about SentinelOne&#8217;s growth and revenue results compared to similar public companies, and working to understand if the company is inexpensive, neutrally priced or expensive compared to current comps. Sound fun? It will be!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s SentinelOne worth?</h2>
<p>Recall that when SentinelOne last raised capital it was valued at $2.7 billion on a pre-money basis. The company was therefore worth just under $3 billion after the $267 million round. The unicorn is going to yeet that figure into space in its IPO, barring something catastrophic.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210628005452/en/SentinelOne-Announces-Increase-in-IPO-Price-Range">new IPO price range</a> of $31 to $32 per share values the company on a much richer basis. With an anticipated simple share count of 253,530,006 after its IPO, inclusive of a private placement, the company would be worth $7.86 billion to $8.11 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify changed the e-commerce landscape by making it easier for merchants to set up their websites both quickly and affordably. A startup called <a href="https://tapcart.com/">Tapcart</a> is now doing the same for mobile commerce.</p>
<p>The company, which has referred to itself as the &#8220;Shopify for mobile apps,&#8221; today powers the shopping apps for top <a href="https://tapcart.com/resources/studies">brands</a>, including Fashion Nova, Pier One Imports, The Hundreds, Patta, Culture Kings, and thousands more. Following a year of 3x revenue growth, in part driven by the pandemic, Tapcart is today announcing the close of a $50 million round of Series B funding, led by Left Lane Capital. Having clearly taken notice of Tapcart&#8217;s traction with its own merchant base, Shopify is among the round&#8217;s participants.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include SignalFire, Greycroft, Act One Ventures and Amplify LA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mobass/">Sina Mobasser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericnetsch/">Eric Netsch</a>, have worked in the mobile app industry for years. Mobasser&#8217;s previous company, TestMax, offered one of the first test prep courses on iOS, while Netsch had more recently worked on the agency side to create mobile and digital experiences for brands. Together, the two realized the potential in helping online merchants bring their businesses to mobile, as easily as they were able to go online with Shopify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170857" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170857" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg 5341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1536,908 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=2048,1210 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170857" class="wp-caption-text">Tapcart’s founders Sina Mobasser and Eric Netsch at their Santa Monica HQ</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you can launch an app on our platform in a matter of weeks, where historically it would take up to a year if you wanted to custom build an app,&#8221; explains Mobasser. &#8220;And you can do it for a low monthly fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s platform itself offers a simple drag-and-drop builder that allows anyone to create a mobile app for their existing Shopify store using tools to design their layout, customize the product detail pages, integrate checkout options, include product reviews, and even optionally add other branded content, like blogs, lookbooks, videos (including live video) and more. Everything is synced directly from Shopify to the app in real-time, so the merchant&#8217;s inventory, products and collections are all kept up-to-date. That&#8217;s a big differentiator from some rivals, which require duplicate sets of data and data transformation.</p>
<p>Tapcart, meanwhile, leverages all of Shopify&#8217;s APIs and SDKs to create a native application that works with Shopify&#8217;s existing data structures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170864" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170864" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=768,750 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=680,664 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tight integration with Shopify helps Tapcart because it doesn&#8217;t have to focus on the e-commerce infrastructure, as the way things are structured around inventory and collections are roughly 90% the same across brands. Instead, Tapcart focuses on the 10% that makes brands stand out from one another, which includes things like branding, content and design. Its CMS allows merchants to create exclusive content, change the colors and fonts, add videos and more to make the app look and feel fully customized.</p>
<p>Beyond the mobile app creation aspect to its business, Tapcart also helps merchants automate their marketing. Through the Tapcart platform, merchants can communicate with their customers in real-time using push notifications that can alert them to new sales, to encourage them to return to abandoned carts, or any other promotions. The marketing campaigns can be automated, as well, which helps merchants schedule their upcoming launches and product drops ahead of time. The company claims these push notifications deliver click-through rates that are 72% higher than a traditional email or SMS text because of their interactivity and branding.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170859" style="width: 1180px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170859" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170859 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=1536,831 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=2048,1108 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170859" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>The platform has quickly found traction with SMB to mid-market enterprise customers who have reached the stage of their business where it makes sense for them to double down on customer retention and conversion and optimize their mobile workflow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sweet spot is when you have maybe a couple hundred customers in your database,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;That&#8217;s a perfect time to now focus less on the paid acquisition portion of your business and more on how to retain and engage those existing customers, [so they&#8217;ll] shop more and have a better experience,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>During the past 12 months, over $1.2 billion in merchant sales have flowed through Tapcart&#8217;s platform. And in 2020, Tapcart&#8217;s recurring revenue increased by 3x, as mobile apps grew even faster during the pandemic, which had increased consumer mobile screen time by 20% year-over-year from 2019. Mobile commerce spending also grew 55% year-over-year, topping $53 billion globally during the holiday shopping season, the company says. Tapcart&#8217;s own merchants saw mobile app orders at a rate of more than once-per-second during this time, and it believes these trends will continue even as the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
<p>Today, Tapcart generates revenue by charging a flat SaaS (software-as-a-service) fee, which differentiates it from a number of competitors who charge a percent of the merchant&#8217;s total sales.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170858" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170858" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_AppClips_SMS.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170858" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>With the additional funding, Tapcart plans to focus on its goal of becoming a vertically integrated mobile commerce suite of tools, which more recently includes support for iOS App Clips. It will also soon release an upgraded version of its insights analytics platform and will offer scripts that merchants can install on their mobile websites to compare what works on the site versus what works in the app.</p>
<p>Later this year, Tapcart plans to launch a full marketing automation product that will allow brands to automate and personalize their notifications even further. And it plans to invest in market expansions to make its product better designed for mobile, global commerce.</p>
<p>The funding will allow Santa Monica-based Tapcart to hire another 200 people over the next 24 months, up from the 70 it has currently. These will include new additions across time zones and even in markets like Australia and Europe as it moves toward global expansion.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s investment will open up a number of new opportunities as well, including on product, engineering, business strategy and partnerships. It will also help to get Tapcart in front of Shopify&#8217;s 1.7 million global merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still quite a lot of merchants that need better mobile experiences, but have yet to really double down on the mobile effort and get something like a native app,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of different ways and methods that merchants are experimenting with mobile growth, and we&#8217;re trying to offer all of the best parts of that in a single platform. So there&#8217;s tons of expansion for Tapcart to do just that with the existing target addressable market,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe brands must be where their customers are, and today that means being on their phones,&#8221; said Satish Kanwar, VP of product acceleration at Shopify, in a statement. &#8220;Tapcart helps merchants create mobile-first shopping experiences that customers love, reinforcing Shopify&#8217;s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We look forward to seeing Tapcart expand its success on Shopify with the more than 1.7 million merchants on our platform today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, TechCrunch is turning its spotlight on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with interviews, profiles, and an event featuring the outgoing mayor, CMU&#8217;s President, and local startups.</p>
<p>The Rust Belt city has spent much of the past decade working to shed the image that arrived in the wake of the deindustrialization of the 1970s and 80s. Courtesy of world class universities like Carnegie Melon and the University of Pittsburgh, the Steel City has transformed itself into a vibrant startup ecosystem and a world class environment for robotics, AI, autonomous driving and other high-tech companies.</p>
<p>Ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s event, TechCrunch spoke to Bill Peduto, who has served as Pittsburgh’s Mayor since 2014, a role that has involved overseeing much of that transformation. The Mayor spoke on his efforts over the past half-dozen years, which will culminate in January when he leaves office.</p>
<p>Peduto will also be speaking at our City Spotlight event Tuesday, June 29, 2021. He&#8217;ll be joining<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/karin-tsai-director-of-engineering-at-duolingo-will-be-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh-on-june-29/"> Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian</a>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>TechCrunch: What are the biggest initiatives that the city government is doing in order to really help foster the startup community?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Bill Peduto</strong>: We’ve been a partner throughout the past seven years, whether it was with the autonomous vehicle industry, the expansion of robotics or artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, we have engaged directly with the startup community, got them involved in city government and also opened up and provided access to public right of ways in order to see those industries expanding. Working with our universities, we’ve been able to recruit international companies to Pittsburgh: Bosch, Tata, Google, Facebook, Intel, Amazon. They have provided parallel advancements in the tech industry. Pittsburgh has become an innovation hub that people will come to not just for one job but because they know there is opportunity to advance in their careers here in specialized fields.</p>
<p><strong>Many of these companies are coming out of CMU, in industries like robotics, automation and self-driving cars. What is your sense of how varied and diverse the startup community is. What is the breakdown of robotics and automation on one side and all of the other tech categories on the other?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that the robotics and autonomous industries have positioned themselves much more visible on the global stage. But the other industries – especially within the startup industry – are competitive for a share of Pittsburgh’s economy. Obviously the partnership we created with Uber, Aurora and Argo AI – they all garnered attention as Pittsburgh became the first city in the world to have autonomous rideshare. But the fact is that CMU had already been testing their vehicles on our streets for a decade before. We became a city that was one of the first to be able to expand upon that. The competitive advantage that we have here is we don’t have to draw the talent here to build out the industries. We produce the talent.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like there has historically been a problem keeping the talent in Pittsburgh. People often move themselves or their companies to a New York or Silicon Valley. Has that shifted? What initiatives have to made to ensure that people not only come to Pittsburgh, but that they stay in Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>It’s incumbent upon local government to create an environment where people want to live. Quality of life matters and is a key indicator in building out a 21st century urban economy. All the different amenities that we add into city government matter. People want to live in a place that provides them with opportunities that don’t involve being at home or being at work. They want to have a place that has free and plentiful open spaces and areas that they can enjoy. Young people want to be around other young people. For decades, Pittsburgh lacked all three. It was a direct result of deindustrialization and disinvestment. We’ve worked very hard as a city government to build up all three and support locally built companies, whether they’re restaurants, stages or theaters, as a critical part not only of the arts and culture of the city, but also as a critical part of our economic development strategy.</p>
<p><strong>I recently spoke to some startups around Detroit and it was kind of a mixed bag when it comes the legacy of having had the automotive industry based in the city. In 2021, what benefits are there to being a legacy industrial city as it pertains to building a startup ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the company itself, not simply the industry. There are companies that have been around for over 100 years that are some of the most cutting edge within our city. They’ve diversified their portfolios and recognized the direction the world is moving and they have decided to become a competitive part of it. Other companies are more reliant on their success in the past as a model of their future development. As you look at cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit, you understand that their industrial past is something they take great pride in and they build of off.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a sense when speaking to fossil fuel companies that they see the writing on the wall when it comes to pivoting to something more green?</strong></p>
<p>Again, it doesn’t get defined by industry. It’s defined by company and, in most cases, CEO. In many cases in Pittsburgh, absolutely, yes. Everything from the creation to the transfer of energy, long established companies are looking to find a way to put Pittsburgh on the map when it comes to transferring to green hydrogen. The leaders in this are not just the universities, but the companies that have been long established in gas and, in some cases, oil.</p>
<p><strong>What is your sense of how long term an impact Covid-19 will have when it comes to decentralizing some of these tech communities.</strong></p>
<p>You used the exact term. I believe that post-Covid will be a decentralization from the coasts to the cities that have been able to create an environment where they would want to locate. When we’re looking at competition, we’re looking at Charlotte, Austin, Nashville. We’re putting ourselves up against those cities and what they can offer to the startup industry. We’re not as much concerned with the New Yorks and the San Franciscos – or even the Bostons. What we see is that we can be highly competitive against any other area that has research and development that is fueled by the education and medical industries.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest hurdle when it comes to being an entrepreneur in Pittsburgh? And what are you doing to help address that?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest hurdle remains access to venture capital, especially in this stage. I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off. However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help to take early stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically what is the city doing to attract the attention [and money] of venture capitalists?</strong></p>
<p>It’s more a partnership with the established intitutions like universities and hospital and our local VC community that have been at the forefront. The city provides the critical backing. I should also mention our corporate and philanthropic communities are also key partners, as well. Working together, we created the Pittsburgh Innovation District. It was a direct results of the Brookings report that came out a few years ago. It is a structural partnership between the city and county government, the philanthropic community, the universities and the UPMC. It is created not only to recruit startup companies, but also to recruit the funding and to be partners in the funding of our startup community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is hoping to attempt to fly its in-development spacecraft Starship to orbit for the first time in July, according to company president Gwynne Shotwell. Shotwell shared the timeline at the International Space Development conference during a virtual speaking engagement.</p>
<p>Starship has been in development for the past several years, and it has been making shorter test flights, but remaining within Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, since last year. Its most recent flight also included its first fully successful landing, which is a key ingredient in the development of the Starship launch system, which is designed to be SpaceX&#8217;s first that is fully reusable.</p>
<p>July (aka next month) is an ambitious timeline for making the first orbital flight attempt of Starship, but in May SpaceX filed its planned course for the flight, which would lift off from the company&#8217;s Starship development site in south Texas near Brownsville (known as &#8216;Starbase&#8217;) and then eventually return to Earth with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean somewhere off the cost of Hawaii.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This first flight won&#8217;t end with a controlled landing, and the focus will be on reaching orbit and testing the spacecraft component through that part of the flight. Later tests will include a controlled landing of the Starship spacecraft, with the goal of eventually making the entire system, including the Super Heavy booster that will help propel it to orbit, fully reusable.</p>
<p>While Shotwell seemed to indicate high confidence that SpaceX is pretty much technically ready to begin orbital test flights of Starship, the company still needs to secure a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in order to perform orbital launches, since its existing license only covers suborbital flights. The FAA is currently in process on reviewing the requirements for that license, including an environmental impact review of what it would mean for the surrounding area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saying goes that, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” That may or may not be true, but at least one “old dog” is working hard to disprove that saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Union has been operating in the cross-border payments space</span><a href="https://www.westernunion.com/blog/6-fascinating-things-about-western-unions-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nearly 150 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (yes, you read that right &#8211; 150 years) and today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">globally, it serves almost 150 million customers – representing senders and receivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a number of fintech startups have emerged to challenge Western Union in the massive space – from Wise (formerly TransferWise) to Remitly to WorldRemit. But the payments giant seems up for the challenge and has been investing heavily in its digital operations in an attempt </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/western-union-often-disrupted-by-startups-partners-a-startup-for-digital-push-in-the-philippines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to beat fintechs at their own game</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a massive acceleration of the trend of all things moving to digital in nearly all industries. Money transfer was no exception. In 2020, Western Union benefited from that acceleration. Its overall digital money transfer revenues &#8211; including </span><a href="http://wu.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WU.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its digital partnership business &#8211; climbed by 38% to more than $850 million, up from over $600 million in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of </span><a href="http://wu.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WU.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company’s online transactions site, it saw a nearly 30% gain in annual active customers to 8.6 million. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Western Union, often disrupted by startups, partners with a startup for digital push in the Philippines&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/western-union-often-disrupted-by-startups-partners-a-startup-for-digital-push-in-the-philippines/embed/#?secret=SGzvCx2YDI" data-secret="SGzvCx2YDI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e company recently projected that its digital money transfer revenues are on track to exceed $1 billion in 2021 after first-quarter revenue growth of 45% to a new quarterly high of $242 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Western Union claims to hold the largest cross-border, digital, peer-to-peer payments network in terms of scale, revenue and channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emphasis on beefing up its digital operations – an initiative that actually began in the second half of 2019, according to the company – and expanding those digital offerings to more countries led to Western Union’s overall business profile shifting over the past 15 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital channels in 2020 made up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">29% of transactions and 20% of revenue for the company’s consumer-to-consumer (C2C) business, up from 16% and 14%, respectively, in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Union also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“open sourced” its platform to third-party financial institutions in a move it says is a “step towards creating an end-to-end payments processing hub.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shellyswanback/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelly Swanback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Western Union’s president of product and platform, about the company’s digital strategy and what’s next beyond payments for the company (hint: it involves banking products). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: Let’s start out by hearing how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted your business, and what kinds of steps you took as a company to adapt?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: As COVID started playing out, just like any other company, I thought ‘What do we need to do to rally around our customers because our customers who rely on retail locations may not be able to get to their retail location as the COVID lockdowns started happening?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things we learned from that experience is this notion of everyday innovation. Innovation isn&#8217;t always blockchain or some emerging technology. Sometimes the best innovation is just about innovating every day with the products and services that you have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we had some places in the world where we actually needed to figure out how we could do home delivery of cash. Delivering cash is different than delivering pizza as you can imagine, as there are a whole lot of regulatory items and security items. We very quickly figured out how we can deliver cash in Sri Lanka and Nepal, Jordan and some other places across the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example lies in addressing how some folks were just a little intimidated by digital technology. I thought, ‘What if we set up a video digital location we called it where people could call in and do a video call with us and we could help them with their money transfer?’ It turned out that there actually wasn&#8217;t as much customer demand for that as we might have thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the great news &#8212; and this is a good lesson, I think, for many organizations &#8212; is what we actually did there in terms of KYC (Know Your Customer), which is a big thing in the financial services industry. So, all the technology we set up for this digital location for customers to upload their documents electronically and not have to be in front of an agent, we’re using today, just in a different way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC: I know Western Union has touted the fact that it has such a strong physical presence in so many locations actually benefits the growth of its digital operations as well as an expansion into other offerings beyond payments. Can you elaborate on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: The success and acceleration that we&#8217;re having in our digital business and of course the quarterly results are great, and we want to continue to do that. But for me, what&#8217;s most exciting is just the solid foundation and the basis gives us to build toward this idea of having a more meaningful account-based relationship with our customers and ability to offer them more than just money transfer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have the fortune of having a trusted brand that&#8217;s known globally and trusted for something that&#8217;s very near and dear to our customers. What we&#8217;re hearing from our customers is they would trust us to provide additional services. So one of the things that we&#8217;re beginning to put plans in place for, and beginning to do some market tests on, is building an ecosystem or building a marketplace if you will. It will all be catered around the 270 million migrants across the world and really connecting them to each other, connecting them to their families and connecting them to merchants who want to sell them goods or provide them services that are very culturally relevant to them,  either where they happen to be living and working or providing them services back home to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the fall, we&#8217;re going to be launching our first market test in Europe. We&#8217;re going to be offering a bank account, debit card, and multi-currency accounts tied of course into our money transfer services, as well as a few other things as we get closer to the market launch. But this really is our first test around providing a more comprehensive set of services.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: You recently announced a tie-up with Google Pay and some others. What is the significance of those partnerships?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: We want to be able to offer our cross-border capabilities and platform in more of a co-branded or white-label fashion, so that we can reach those customers that might still prefer to just be a customer of a bank. As an example, we recently announced that Google Pay users can log in to their app and can do cross-border transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that&#8217;s an important part of our strategy– going after the direct relationship with customers and at the same time being able to offer our platform to others who already have a direct relationship with our customer. This is also part of our whole technology modernization right now of course. We&#8217;re very, very strong in the C2C segment, but the way we&#8217;re going about our technology modernization is one that provides us optionality to continue to expand in other segments  – whether it be consumer to business or business to consumer, or even business to business.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: Tell me more about this “modernization.”</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Swanback</em></strong>: Like many financial organizations and many existing global organizations, part of our massive technology modernization program is moving to the cloud. So we were well on our way from migrating many of our applications to an AWS Cloud Platform. We’re pretty excited about the progress that we&#8217;re making there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, over the last 12 to 18 months, we’ve migrated a good portion of our customer agent transactions, like the core of our data, to Snowflake. We;&#8217;ve mined 33 data warehouses, and we&#8217;ve got 20 petabytes of data in the cloud. And so, that in itself is just this is just the starting point. We&#8217;re modernizing our apps on top of this data foundation and really starting to use artificial intelligence and machine learning. But we’re not using it in the back end processes like many other organizations who were using it for operational interactions with our customers. We&#8217;re using it in the front office. For example, we launched a telephone money transfer product where a customer talks to a virtual assistant and it’s 100% digitized. It’s actually one of the best customer experiences we&#8217;ve seen.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, happy belated birthday to Chris Gates, one of the founding members of the show. His birthday was yesterday, and while he&#8217;s on vacation for two weeks, we still wanted to give him a shoutout. Chris is a very good person, a good friend, a good father, a good partner. He&#8217;s kind, supportive, and hilarious. And he has a very good beard.</p>
<p>But Equity waits for no single person, regardless of their merit, so on we went! Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks are a bit blah this morning, though set to rise in the United States. Cryptos are up a little.</li>
<li>From the weekend, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-to-charge-users-for-selling-goods-and-services-11624705202?mod=djemalertNEWS">Venmo is getting into e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-06-27/big-ipads-apple-car-changes-amazon-ar-glasses-inside-big-tech-labs">Apple loves Surface</a>.</li>
<li>From this morning: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57632831">Binance is beefing with the United Kingdom</a> and appears to be winning, which is somewhat humorous.</li>
<li>On the funding round beat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/slice-raises-20-million-to-go-after-credit-card-industry-in-india/">Slice raised $20 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/robotic-beverage-maker-botrista-raises-10m/">Botrista raised $10 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/thursday-snags-3-5m-for-a-dating-app-thats-live-once-a-week/">Thursday raised $3.5 million</a>.</li>
<li>We wrapped with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/google-to-android-devs-support-more-form-factors-get-a-higher-sales-cut/">this</a>.</li>
</ul>
