										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new breed of startups is acquiring and growing small but promising third-party merchants, and building out their own economies of scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while there are a number of such startups based in the U.S. and Europe, none had emerged in the Latin American market. Until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://valoreo.com/en/">Valoreo</a>, a Mexico City-based acquirer of e-commerce businesses, announced Tuesday that it has raised $50 million of equity and debt financing in a seed funding round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar amount is large for a seed round by any standards, but most certainly ranks among the highest ever raised by a Latin American startup &#8212; further evidence of increased investor interest in the region’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burgeoning venture scene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upper90, FJ Labs, Angel Ventures, Presight Capital and a slew of angel investors participated in the round. Those angels included David Geisen, head of Mercado Libre Mexico; BEA Systems’ co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred Chuang;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Tushar Ahluwalia, founder of Razor Group, a European marketplace aggregator, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in late 2020, Valoreo aims to invest in, operate and scale e-commerce brands as part of its self-described mission “to bring better products at more affordable prices” to the Latin American consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were substantially oversubscribed and were therefore able to select investors that not only provide capital, but also additional know-how in key areas,” said co-founder Alex Gruell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo joins the growing number of startups focused on rolling up e-commerce brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model is similar to that of Thrasio &#8212; which just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised another $750 million</span></a> &#8211;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;  and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. But Valoreo says its approach has been tailored to “the specific needs of the Latin American market and is specifically focused on the Latin American end customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another new company in the space called Branded recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others in the space include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin Brands Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SellerX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as my colleague Ingrid Lunden </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">points out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the feverish pace of fundraising in the area of FBA roll-ups feels very much like a bubble in the market — not least because none of these still-young companies have yet to prove that the strategy to buy up and consolidate these sellers is a useful and profitable one.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Thrasio raises $750M more in equity for its Amazon roll-up play&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/embed/#?secret=LxaVq7d0MP" data-secret="LxaVq7d0MP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How it works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo (which the company says is an extension of the Spanish word “valor,” meaning to add value</span><b>),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquires merchants that operate their own brands and primarily sell on online marketplaces such as Mercado Libre, Amazon and Linio. The company targets brands that offer “category-leading products” and which it believes have “significant growth potential.” It also develops brands in-house to offer a broader selection of products to the end customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Thrasio, Valoreo says it’s able to help entrepreneurs who may lack the resources and access to capital to take their businesses to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and co-CEO Stefan Florea says the company takes less than five weeks typically from its initial contact with a seller to a final payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the acquired and developed brands are integrated into the company’s consolidated holding. By tapping its team of “specialists” in areas such as digital marketing and supply chain management, it claims to be able to help these brands “reach new heights” while giving the entrepreneurs behind the companies “an attractive exit,” or partial exit in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have different structures, always taking into account the personal objectives of the seller,” Stefan Florea added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally Valoreo acquires the majority of the business, with the purchase price typically being a combination of an upfront cash payment and a profit share component so sellers can still earn money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Valoreo plans to use its new capital mostly to acquire and develop “interesting” brands, as well as build out its current team of 10 while expanding its infrastructure and operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently focused on the Mexican and Brazilian markets, but is planning its expansion into other Latin American countries where it has strong local support systems, such as Colombia, according to co-founder Martin Florea.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission is to be a pan-Latin American player providing value to the entire region,” Martin Florea said. “Latin America in general and Mexico in particular are in a distinct situation which provides phenomenal opportunities for e-commerce merchants on the one hand but also presents particular challenges on the other hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those challenges, according to Martin Florea, include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">limited access to growth capital, a lack of specialized expertise in certain areas (such as supply chain management), limited opportunities to sell their business and pursue new ventures, as well as operational burdens and the lack of capacities to expand into new countries and marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo emphasizes it is not out to compete with Mercado Libre, Amazon and other regional marketplaces but instead wants to partner with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without these platforms, this opportunity would not exist,” Martin Florea said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernán Fernández, founder and managing partner of Angel Ventures, believes Valoreo “will add a lot of value” to the Latin American e-commerce landscape, which is experiencing both market growth and the fragmentation of the seller space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">Jüsto</a> co-founder and CEO (and Valoreo investor) Ricardo Weder notes that the e-commerce market is at an inflection point in Latin America. According to eMarketer, the region was the </span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-will-fastest-growing-retail-ecommerce-market-this-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest-growing e-commerce market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world in 2020, with 37% year over year growth. However, it is a much more fragmented and crowded market compared to other regions, such as the United States.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, Valoreo believes, provides an opportunity for consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are still many consumers that are not aware of the great variety of outstanding local brands that sell innovative products on marketplaces online,” Stefan Florea said. “In the U.S. or Europe e-commerce is the new way of shopping, offering an even greater range of products and brands than offline shopping. We firmly believe it will not take long until end-customers in Mexico and across Latin America discover all the benefits that e-commerce offers.”</span></p>

<p>The price of bitcoin, the world&#8217;s best-known cryptocurrency, has historically proven a reasonable proxy for consumer interest in the cryptocurrency space, and for <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume/2y/USD?r=week&amp;t=lb&amp;vu=curr">trading activity amongst blockchain-based assets</a>. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has retreated since the milestone, and is now worth just over $49,000.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been on a tear this year, rising from around the $30,000 mark at the start of 2021 to its recent $50,000 milestone, a gain or around 66%. Looking back a year and the gains are even more impressive, with the price of bitcoin rising from around $10,000 a year ago to its current price, a gain of 400%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Luckily for investors and believers in other decentralized tokens, it&#8217;s not just bitcoin that is enjoying a valuation updraft. Cardano, one of the most highly-valued blockchain assets, is up around 28% in the last week according <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">to CoinMarketCap</a>. Its total value is nearing the $8 billion mark.</p>
<p>Companies built atop the burgeoning cryptocurrency space could be enjoying a boom as the price of bitcoin advances; as trading activity and consumer interest tend to rise along with the price of bitcoin, and companies like Coinbase make money from trading activity and consumer use, 2021 is starting off strongly.</p>
<p>Coinbase has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">filed to go public</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/coinbase-is-going-public-via-direct-listing/">intends to pursue a direct listing</a> in short order.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s driving the price of bitcoin and its sister-tokens up in the short-term? In a market melt-up its hard to point fingers with any accuracy. But broadly speaking if it feels that nearly every asset class is setting new all-time records, so why not bitcoin as well?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pex.com">Pex</a>, a startup aiming to giving rightsholders more control over how their content is used and reused online, has raised $57 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The round comes from existing investors including Susa Ventures and Illuminate Ventures, as well as Tencent, Tencent Music Entertainment, the CueBall Group, NexGen Ventures Partners, Amaranthine and others.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Pex had <a href="https://pex.com/pex-secures-7m-in-series-seed-financing/">previously raised $7 million</a>, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/legalizing-remix-culture/">acquired music rights startup Dubset</a> last year. Founder and CEO Rasty Turek told me that while the product has evolved from what he described as &#8220;a Google-like search engine for rightsholders to find copyright infringement&#8221; into a broader platform, the vision of creating a better system of managing copyright and payments online has remained the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup describes its Attribution Engine as the &#8220;licensing infrastructure for the Internet,&#8221; bringing together the individuals and companies who own content rights, creators who might want to license and remix that content, the big digital platforms where content gets shared and the law enforcement agencies that want to monitor all of this.</p>
<p>The product includes six modules — an asset registry, a system for identifying those assets when they&#8217;re used in new content, a licensing system, a dispute resolution system, a payment system and data and reporting to see how your content is being used.</p>
<p>Turek said that while Pex is being used by &#8220;most of the largest rightsholders in the world,&#8221; the system was built to be accessible to &#8220;a struggling musician out on the streets of Los Angeles&#8221; who doesn&#8217;t have the resources to &#8220;police all of this content&#8221; online.</p>

<p>He also suggested that the broader regulatory environment is calling for a solution like Pex, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/"> the European Union passing a new copyright directive</a> that&#8217;s set to take effect this year, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stimulus-bill-streaming/"> new copyright legislation</a> also on the table in the United States. The EU bill was criticized for potentially prompting larger platforms to preemptively block broad swaths of content, but Turek argued, &#8220;There&#8217;s so much content out there in search of an audience that this is going to be the opposite of overblocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Pex is taking is relying entirely on regulators. Turek also said the platform is structured to balance the needs of the different groups using it — and that it has an incentive to strike that balance because its revenue comes from licensing deals, so it&#8217;s focused on &#8220;really being the Switzerland, really being the neutral party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We designed all of our business around the idea that if we try to abuse the system, we lose, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t make money [when someone] abuses the system, we only make money when everybody plays nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turek also claimed that public domain and Creative Commons licenses are &#8220;first class citizens&#8221; on the platform, and that many of the rightsholders using the Attribution Engine don&#8217;t necessarily want monetary compensation: &#8220;A lot of people are happy to do this for recognition. We are social animals.&#8221; (Plus, recognition can lead to moneymaking opportunities.)</p>
<p>Pex says the new funding will allow it to continue scaling the Attribution Engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe investments are valdation,&#8221; Turek added. &#8220;I believe they&#8217;re more obligation than validation, but they do prove you are directionally correct.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in late-2014, Salt Lake City-based Zencastr has become a kind of lifeline for many podcasters, as the pandemic pushed formerly in-person podcasts online. The startup is hardly a household name, but the company says it’s used by around 6% of all podcasts, based on an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million active shows in the world.</p>
<p>I can certainly say, anecdotally, that just about every podcaster I’ve spoken to has tried the service, which offers a more specialized solution than video chat programs like Zoom and Skype. Some have managed to retrofit the latter to their needs, but Zencastr’s solution offers, among other things, high-quality audio recordings saved both locally and in the cloud.</p>
<p>As of last June, the company has also been testing a video feature. That’s long been a missing piece of the puzzle. I know I’ve moved over to Zoom since taking my show online during the pandemic. As pretty much any person can tell you a little over a year into the pandemic, video chat is no replacement for in-person interactions, but it works in a pinch. At the very least, it creates an additional dimension of human interaction you don’t get with voice alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Up to now, the video offering was only available as a closed beta. Today the beta opens to all users, bringing with it HD video recording, coupled with the already high-quality sound. I’ve been toying around with the feature for my own podcast and find it to be less straightforward than services like Zoom, but more customizable. It leaves you with HD video files you can edit into a tighter show or simply go with the split screen. There’s also a live chat, footnotes and a soundboard, much of which seemed aimed at essentially editing the shows in real time.</p>
<p>Along with the broader arrival of the video feature, Zencastr is announcing a $4.6 million seed round &#8212; the service’s first major funding since launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mgMGNtp7bo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/zencastr-is-testing-a-video-podcasting-tool-in-limited-beta/">Zencastr is testing a video podcasting tool in limited beta</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zencastr is testing a video podcasting tool in limited beta&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/zencastr-is-testing-a-video-podcasting-tool-in-limited-beta/embed/#?secret=mgMGNtp7bo" data-secret="mgMGNtp7bo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founder and CEO Josh Nielsen tells TechCrunch that Zencastr has thus far been, “bootstrapped, self-funded and really just kind of a grassroots company in the podcasting space. A lot of people are getting interested in podcasting right now and we feel like it’s important to have a company like ours continue to represent our creators. They’re our North Star.”</p>
<p>As interest in podcasting has grown, Zencastr’s use has expanded with it. The company says it has seen around a 147% growth in podcasting hours since the beginning of COVID-19. The seed round is led by Utah-based Kickstart, with participation from former Flipagram executives Brian Dilley and Farhad Mohit and former Skullcandy CEO Jeremy Andrus, among others.</p>
<p>“This company started off pretty small and didn’t have a lot of resources,” Nielsen adds. “But we’ve always been profitable, we’ve always been growing. We still are, but we’re raising money to accelerate that growth. This is also a rebrand and a step forward in the reliability and stability of the platform.”</p>
<p>Stability has been something of an issue in the past with many of the Zencastr users I’ve spoken to. Spending more time with this service ahead of this news, I certainly found some nits to pick, including an audio delay I haven’t experienced with non-devoted services like Skype and Zoom. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s the kind of thing that can really throw you off your rhythm during an interview. The video presentation is also lacking in sophistication, but that’s to be expected in a closed beta.</p>
<p>The funding will go to smoothing out some of those wrinkles, as well as hiring.</p>
<p>“Headcount is one of the primary reasons for raising this round,” co-founder and CPO Adrian Lopez tells TechCrunch. “We were a fully distributed team before COVID existed. We have people in 11 different countries around the world. That was a very conscious choice. We believe that distribution allows us to work with some of the best people, regardless of where they are.”</p>
<p>Today also sees the launch of “Digital Nomad,” a podcast series produced by Zencastr that explores its own origin story. Though, the company is quick to add that this isn’t the beginning of a major push into producing original content.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in podcasting as a medium that connects people,” says Lopez. “We formed the company around that. We’re fully distributed so we can put our money where our mouth is and put people all over and connect via this medium. We want to start telling that story.”</p>
<p>Zencastr has seen a fair bit of increased competition in the category, including the likes of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/squadcast-adds-video-podcast-recording/"> SquadCast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/rverside-fm/">Riverside.fm</a>. The company’s solid growth over the past year could also see some regression as more people feel comfortable recording shows in person, as the vaccines have been sufficiently distributed.</p>
<p>“We’re going to see some retraction, I think, as things and people go back to work,” says Lopez. “But I think it will all come out in the wash, because there’s just a much bigger-growing interest in podcasting over all. It happened before COVID and it will continue after COVID.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.titanvest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a retail investment management platform aimed at millennials, has closed on $12.5 million in a Series A round led by VC heavyweight General Catalyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bevy of other investors put money in the round, including Sound Ventures (actor Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s VC firm), Scribble VC, Y Combinator, South Park Commons, Instagram founder Mike Krieger, Lee Fixel and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan is hoping to build on the momentum it saw in 2020, during which it grew revenue, customers and assets under management by 600%, “with effectively no marketing budget, according to co-founder Joe Percoco. The New York-based company says it’s approaching $500 million in assets under management and was cash flow positive last year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percoco met co-CEO Clay Gardner while the pair were at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We came from two different backgrounds with respect to investing,” Percoco recalled. “He was the type that bought his first shares of stock at the ages of 11 and 12. I’m the exact opposite and couldn’t invest myself until after Goldman Sachs, where I went to work after Penn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the duo both worked in the industry, they found that friends and family were always asking them how they should manage their capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were sending them to ETFs and mutual funds in our day jobs,” Percoco said. “But we realized they did not have the same access to investing that the wealthier did.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated with only helping the rich get richer, the pair </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Titan in 2017 with the goal of disrupting what they viewed as “an archaic industry. They&#8217;ve since built an operating system aimed at giving “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyday investors access to the types of investment products and experiences that they’ve historically been locked out of.&#8221; Or, as they describe, it a mobile version of what investment giants Fidelity and BlackRock created decades ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan&#8217;s capital management platform is designed for both accredited and unaccredited investors. The company says it provides access to services that would historically require a $1 million minimum, such as direct portfolio manager access. It charges a fee amounting to just 1% of assets, compared to the 2% – and in some cases 20% of profits – that legacy players charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe Fidelity 2.0 will be direct-to-consumer with no walls and no black boxes,” Percoco said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For the unacquainted, according to </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-box-accounting.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investopedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack box accounting is the deliberate use of complex bookkeeping methodologies to make interpreting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial statements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging and time-consuming.)</span></p>
<p>Its simplicity sets it apart. TechCrunch chooses stocks via its &#8220;proprietary and discretionary&#8221; research process based on the principals&#8217; previous experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup currently offers two stock-focused strategies on its platform,</span></p>
<p>One of those strategies, called Flagship, is focused on large cap growth. The other, called Opportunities, focuses on smaller, under-the-radar companies.</p>
<div>All clients have direct access to its investment team and investor relations via Titan&#8217;s mobile operating system. The company also offers instant deposits, personal digital vaults (or separately managed accounts), fractional share-trading, and no lock-ups.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan’s core customer is the young professional in the 25-35 age range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re already investing money somewhere, even if not that much of their money,” Gardner said. “But they’re well attuned to the reasons they should be&#8230; And, most asset management products remain in the Stone Age, offering 90-page prospectuses and black-box client experiences.”</span></p>
<p>As former TC editor Josh Constine explained when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/31/titan-robo-advisor/">raised a $2.5 million seed round</a> in October 2018, Titan differs from Robinhood or E*Trade, where users essentially are left to fend for themselves. But clients also have some control, unlike passive options such as Wealthfront and Betterment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Titan plans to use its new capital to scale its engineering and investment team, as well as make “significant investments” in product, marketing and operations. It also plans to launch several investment products across a variety of asset classes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many legacy players are hungry to have an OS to serve more folks they historically could not,” Percoco said. “We’re getting inbounds from legacy players in the space seeking to manage capital for new generations and realizing it will shift to mobile operating systems like Titan&#8217;s. Eventually, we can enable them to build their own investment products on Titan.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Boyle, partner at General Catalyst and Titan board member, said she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was struck by Percoco and Gardner’s “deep empathy” for investors who are often overlooked &#8212; such as millennials and new investors “who have cash sitting in their checking accounts and want expert management but don’t know where to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They don’t want to be stock pickers but they don’t want a set-it-and-forget-it product,” Boyle said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another level of sophistication with actively managed products where the best managers are making investment decisions on behalf of those who can afford it. But there’s no reason why retail investors should be excluded from this model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thinks Titan can capitalize on what she believes is millennials’ “deep lack of trust” in legacy institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need new institutions like Titan to combat this lack of trust,” Boyle said. “And these new institutions need to have incentives that are aligned with their clients, not with hedge funds or banks.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared electric moped startup Revel will start offering monthly electric bike subscriptions in New York, the second new business venture the company has announced in the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Revel said Tuesday it was expanding its product line — which until the end of January consisted only of shared mopeds — to include monthly subscriptions to electric bikes. The subscriptions will be available to residents of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The bikes, which are manufactured by WING Bikes, come equipped with a 36-volt battery that can travel 45 miles on a single charge, pedal assist and can reach speeds of 20 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The monthly electric bike subscription plan will be offered for $99 a month and includes the bike rental, lock, battery and all repairs and maintenance. Revel promised that  maintenance on normal bike issues will be conducted within 24 hours of a customer reporting a problem. Users will also receive educational materials on bike laws, safety, and locking best practices at multiple touchpoints, including in-app and printed materials, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revel launched in 2018 with a shared fleet of electric mopeds. The company, which founded by Frank Reig and Paul Suhey, started with a pilot program in Brooklyn and later expanded to Queens, the Bronx and sections of Manhattan. It ramped up its business thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/electric-moped-startup-revel-raises-27-6-million-as-it-eyes-new-markets/">$27.6 million in capital</a> raised in October 2019 in a Series A round led by Ibex Investors. In its first 18 months of operation, Revel expanded its shared moped business to other cities such as Austin, which has since shutdown, as well as Miami and Washington, D.C. Last year, the company launched in Oakland and received a permit in July 2020 to operate in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Revel bopped along as a shared moped business until February 3, when it announced plans to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/">DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles</a> in New York City. The company said that this new “Superhub,” which is located at the former Pfizer building in Brooklyn, will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. This will be the first in a network of Superhubs opened by Revel across New York City, the company said. Revel said at the time it would use Tritium’s new RTM75 model for the first 10 chargers at its Brooklyn site, which will go live this spring. These chargers are designed to deliver 100 additional miles of charge to an electric vehicle in about 20 minutes, according to Revel.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s added a third business venture of electric bike subscriptions. And it appears Reig is ready to diversify further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at Revel is to electrify cities,&#8221; Reig said in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We are expanding into eBikes to continue to deliver on this mission, and to provide additional access to our users in cities like New York. Safe to say that this will not be our last big announcement in 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>A waitlist will open up Tuesday and bikes will be delivered to customers starting in early March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched yet another batch of Starlink satellites – a full complement of 60, the standard size for its current Falcon 9-based Starlink missions. This brings SpaceX&#8217;s total to just around 1,000 in active on orbit, taking into account the handful that were experimental or have been de-orbited to date. This follows SpaceX&#8217;s opening of orders for Starlink to anyone in a current or planned coverage zone.</p>
<p>Starlink is a global satellite-based data network powered by small, low-Earth orbit satellites. Historically, broadband satellites have been large, expensive spacecraft positioned much further out from Earth in a fixed orbit, providing service to a single coverage area. Because of their distance from Earth and the way they connect to base stations, coverage has been very high-latency and relatively inconsistent (which you&#8217;ll recognize if you&#8217;ve ever tried to use Wifi on a flight, for instance). SpaceX&#8217;s constellation-based approach sees the satellites positioned much closer to Earth, which improves latency, and also has the satellites orbiting Earth and handing off connections between one another, which in theory provides more consistent coverage – particularly as the size of the constellation grows.</p>
<p>Eventually, SpaceX intends to provide coverage globally from Starlink, with an emphasis on offering service to areas. where coverage has been weak due to ground infrastructure challenges in past. For now, however, coverage is limited, though SpaceX recently expanded its closed beta to an open one, with anyone able to sign up via the Starlink website after an address check, and place an order, including a deposit with the full amount for the hardware kit to be charged once it ships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Starlink&#8217;s hardware includes a small satellite receiver dish for installation by the customer at their service address. The service itself costs $99 per month, while the equipment is $499 (one-time fee). This does seem steep, but SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter recently that the plan is to have the costs come down over time, once the significant initial investment is recouped. He also noted that the plan is still to spin off <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/spacexs-starlink-accepting-99-preorders-as-musk-considers-ipo.html">Starlink and have it IPO eventually</a>, once the company &#8220;can predict cash flow reasonably well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vikrum Aiyer, the now-former vice president of global public policy and strategic communications at Postmates, <a href="https://medium.com/@vikrum/an-exit-memo-on-the-gig-economy-58b9210988a8">penned a memo</a> to his former colleagues and other stakeholders in the gig economy outlining what he thinks needs to happen next in the industry.</p>
<p>In his letter, Aiyer says &#8220;it would be a mistake for us to think that mild tweaks to worker classification, or a single state ballot measure, create a durable path forward for meaningfully addressing what Americans truly worry about: the chance to work, take care of their families, and not fret about what comes next.&#8221;</p>
<p>He goes on to say how tech platforms, labor advocates and other stakeholders &#8220;are not willing to evolve and give an inch on their respective models,&#8221; which means &#8220;we&#8217;ll never see progress that both empowers on-demand work and improves the social safety net.&#8221; Aiyer wants &#8220;this uncivil war that pits workers against capital, tech against labor unions, conservative versus liberal&#8221; to end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the letter, Aiyer puts forth a handful of recommendations for on-demand tech companies. He <span style="font-weight: 400;">proposes, for example, that companies give board seats with voting rights to workers, embrace portable benefits “that can close the gap between what’s available to W2 and independent workers” and consider sectoral bargaining for gig workers.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sectoral bargaining for independent workers would be an innovative reform that could provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sector-wide floors on earnings and benefits, while retaining IC classification. Some in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organized labor have suggested extending the right to bargain for all workers &#8211;regardless </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of classification. Before industry dismisses this outright, and since this has not been done </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before in the US, it warrants critical examination by Congress, the GAO, or university labor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centers to explore how card check rules, antitrust laws, and federal preemptions would be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounted for. In concept, this could empower workers and prevent less scrupulous </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">companies from gaining a competitive advantage with a race to the bottom.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>While Aiyer, along with Postmates and Uber, was a proponent of California&#8217;s Proposition 22, which legally classified gig workers as independent contractors, he says he does not want a carbon copy of it to be implemented throughout the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Prop 22 was a step forward when it comes to the argument that tech is making of balancing worker flexibility with more benefits on top of the 1099 status, there are two issues that need to prescribe the rest of the path forward,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The first is that this type of work has become rather popular, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to millions of lost jobs throughout the country. Secondly, Aiyer says it&#8217;s important to get input from workers as companies push similar legislation either in other parts of the country, or at the federal level.</p>
<p>Aiyer pointed to a key difference in Postmates couriers in Los Angeles versus New York. In Los Angeles, Aiyer said many Postmates couriers are in cars while in New York, many are on bikes. Prop 22 put forth a new floor for insurance standard, but &#8220;that might not be the same type of coverage someone on a bike wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prop 22 established a floor for California, but it certainly is not the ceiling of broader safety net reforms and what a nationwide policy should look like,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But for some gig workers, they have long said they don&#8217;t want to be independent contractors &#8212; even if that does come with some extra benefits. Instead, some have said they want to be employees and be entitled to the full range of benefits that W-2 status provides.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WTapxryic4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/">An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/embed/#?secret=WTapxryic4" data-secret="WTapxryic4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ultimately, Aiyer thinks it&#8217;s a false dichotomy to have a binary in our society where there are workers with benefits and independent workers without.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about having both a W-2 full-time employee model and you can raise the standard of independent work to a new height of benefits and you can have both,&#8221; Aiyer said. &#8220;But to do that in a way that is inclusive to workers and labor advocates, you need to have a reset of those conversations, which haven&#8217;t really been taking place since AB 5.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aiyer, whose last day at Uber-owned Postmates was in early January, told me he hopes for his letter to reinvigorate conversations between the different stakeholders in the space. As for him, Aiyer told me his next professional move will be doing public interest work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Israeli startup </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.redefinemeat.com/"><span>Redefine Meat</span></a><span>, which has developed a manufacturing process to make plant-based proteins that more closely resemble choice cuts of beef than the current crop of hamburger-adjacent offerings, has gotten a big vote of confidence from the investment arm of one of Asia&#8217;s premier food brands. </span></p>
<p>The company has raised $29 million in financing from <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.happinesscapital.com/"><span>Happiness Capital</span></a><span>, the investment arm backed by the family fortunes of Hong Kong&#8217;s Lee Kum Kee condiment dynasty, and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.hanacovc.com/"><span>Hanaco Ventures</span></a><span>, an investment firm backing startups in New York and Israel.</span></p>
<p>Investors have stampeded into the plant-based food industry, spurred by the rising fortunes of companies like Beyond Meat, which has inked partnerships with everyone from Pepsico to McDonald&#8217;s, and Impossible Foods, which counts Burger King among the brands boosting its plant-based faux meat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While these companies have perfected plant patties that can delight the taste buds, the prospect of carving up a big honkin cut of pea protein in the form of a ribeye, sirloin or rump steak, has been a technical hurdle these companies have yet to overcome in a commercial offering.</p>
<p>Redefine Meat thinks its manufacturing processes have cracked the code on the formulation of plant-based steak.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the only ones. In Barcelona, a startup called <a href="https://www.novameat.com/">Novameat</a> raised roughly $300,000 earlier this year for its own take on plant-based steak. That company raised its money from the NEOTEC Program of the Spanish Center for Industrial Technological Development.</p>
<p>Both companies are using 3-D printing technologies to make meat substitutes that mimic the taste and texture of steaks, rather than trying to approximate the patties, meatballs, and ground meat that companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible have taken to market.</p>
<p>Backing Redefine&#8217;s path to market are a host of other investors including Losa Group, Sake Bosch, and K3 Ventures.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the new funding to expand its portfolio and support the commercial launch of its products. Redefine aims to have a large-scale production facility for its 3-D printers online before the end of the year, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>In January, Redefine Meat announced a strategic agreement with the Israeli distributor Best Meister and the company has been expanding its staff with a current headcount of roughly 40 employees.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to change the belief that delicious meat can only come from animals, and we have all the building blocks in place to make this a reality: high-quality meat products, strategic partnerships with stakeholders across the world, a large-scale pilot line under construction, and the first-ever industrial 3D Alt-Meat printers set to be deployed within meat distributors later this year,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshchar-ben-shitrit/?originalSubdomain=il">Eschar Ben-Shitrit</a>, the company&#8217;s chief executive, in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian conglomerate Tata Group has reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/indian-online-grocery-startup-bigbasket-raises-60m/">grocery delivery startup BigBasket</a>, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The salt-to-software giant is buying over 60% stake in BigBasket, valuing the Indian startup between $1.8 billion to $2 billion, the source said, requesting anonymity as the deal is still private. BigBasket has raised over $750 million prior to the deal with Tata.</p>
<p>Indian news network ET Now <a href="https://twitter.com/ETNOWlive/status/1361610643929919488">reported</a> on Tuesday that the two firms were in advanced talks, signals of which began to emerge in local media two quarters ago. Two BigBasket co-founders and Tata Group did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chinese internet giant Alibaba, which owns nearly 30% stake in BigBasket, and a handful of other investors are getting a near complete exit from the startup as part of the deal with Tata Group, the source said. New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">introduced restrictions</a> last year that made it difficult for Chinese investors to write checks to Indian firms.</p>
<p>The move comes as Mumbai-headquartered Tata Group, which reported a revenue of $113 billion in 2019 and operates several popular brands such as Jaguar Land Rover and tea maker Tetley, looks to expand to more consumer businesses and works to develop a so-called superapp in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Bangalore-headquartered BigBasket, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/15/grofers-lands-200m/">SoftBank-backed Grofers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">Reliance’s JioMart</a>, operates in over two dozen cities in India and turned profitable months into the coronavirus pandemic as sales skyrocketed on the platform.</p>
<p>BigBasket and Grofers&#8217;s userbases skyrocketed by as much as 80% last year, analysts at Citi Bank estimated in recent note, adding that JioMart, run by India&#8217;s richest man Mukesh Ambani, had already started to pose serious competition.</p>
<p>In a recent note to clients, Bank of America analysts estimated that the online grocery delivery market could be worth $12 billion in India by 2023.</p>
<p>“Competition is high in the sector with large verticals like BigBasket/Grofers and horizontal like Amazon/Flipkart trying to convert the unorganized market to organized one. Till recently the No 1 player in the space was BigBasket, with it hitting $1 billion annualized GMV &amp; selling over 300,000 orders every day. Reliance Industries also threw its hat with the company launching its JioMart app in May-20 across 200 cites,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The expansion of Reliance Industries, one of India&#8217;s largest industrial houses, in e-commerce last year may have prompted Tata Group to accelerate its digital efforts. Ambani raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/reliance-retail-raises-1-3-billion-from-pif/">more than $26 billion for his telecom and retail empires</a> Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail last year from a roster of marquee investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">including Facebook and Google</a>.</p>
<p>Tata Group was working to expand to several consumer-facing digital services as early as 2016, but a boardroom coup put all those plans <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-alibaba-lost-india-a-tale-of-missed-opportunities-and-bad-luck">on the back burner</a>, The Information reported in December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is facing a fresh round of regulatory complaints in Europe where consumer protection groups have filed a series of coordinated complaints alleging multiple breaches of EU law.</p>
<p>The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) has lodged a complaint against the video sharing site with the European Commission and the bloc&#8217;s network of consumer protection authorities, while consumer organisations in 15 countries have alerted their national authorities and urged them to investigate the social media giant’s conduct, <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-files-complaint-against-tiktok-multiple-eu-consumer-law-breaches/html">BEUC said today</a>.</p>
<p>The complaints include claims of unfair terms, including in relation to copyright and TikTok&#8217;s virtual currency; concerns around the type of content children are being exposed to on the platform; and accusations of misleading data processing and privacy practices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Details of the alleged breaches are set out in two reports associated with the complaints: One covering <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-012_tiktok_without_filters.pdf">issues with TikTok&#8217;s approach to consumer protection</a>, and another focused on <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-010_confusing_by_design-a_data_protection_law_analysis_of_tiktok_s_privacy_policy.pdf">data protection and privacy</a>.</p>

<h2>Child safety</h2>
<p>On child safety, the report accuses TikTok of failing to protect children and teenagers from hidden advertising and &#8220;potentially harmful&#8221; content on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok’s marketing offers to companies who want to advertise on the app contributes to the proliferation of hidden marketing. Users are for instance triggered to participate in branded hashtag challenges where they are encouraged to create content of specific products. As popular influencers are often the starting point of such challenges the commercial intent is usually masked for users. TikTok is also potentially failing to conduct due diligence when it comes to protecting children from inappropriate content such as videos showing suggestive content which are just a few scrolls away,&#8221; the BEUC writes in a press release.</p>
<p>TikTok has already faced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">regulatory intervention in Italy this year </a>in response to child safety concerns &#8212; in that instance after the death of a ten year old girl in the country. Local media had reported that the child died of asphyxiation after participating in a &#8216;black out&#8217; challenge on TikTok &#8212; triggering the emergency intervention by the DPA.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards TikTok agreed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order/">reissue an age gate</a> to verify the age of every user in Italy, although the check merely asks the user to input a date to confirm their age so seems trivially easy to circumvent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok will recheck the age of every user in Italy after DPA order&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order/embed/#?secret=RXdp4NA0xV" data-secret="RXdp4NA0xV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the BEUC&#8217;s report, the consumer rights group draws attention to TikTok&#8217;s flimsy age gate, writing that: &#8220;In practice, it is very easy for underage users to register on the platform as the age verification process is very loose and only self-declaratory.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while it notes TikTok&#8217;s privacy policy claims the service is &#8220;not directed at children under the age of 13&#8221; the report cites a number of studies that found heavy use of TikTok by children under 13 &#8212; with BEUC suggesting that children in fact make up &#8220;a very big part&#8221; of TikTok&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>In France, 45% of children below 13 have indicated using the app. In the United Kingdom, a 2020 study from the Office for Telecommunications (OFCOM) revealed that 50% of children between eight and 15 upload videos on TikTok at least weekly. In Czech Republic, a 2019 study found out that TikTok is very popular among children aged 11-12. In Norway, a news article reported that 32% of children aged 10-11 used TikTok in 2019. In the United States, The New York Times revealed that more than one-third of daily TikTok users are 14 or younger, and many videos seem to come from children who are below 13. The fact that many underage users are active on the platform does not come as a surprise as recent studies have shown that, on average, a majority of children owns mobile phones earlier and earlier (for example, by the age of seven in the UK).</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/429037-bypassing-age-verification-measures-on-social-media-apps-is-easy-as-pie">EU-backed study</a> also found that age checks on popular social media platforms are &#8220;basically ineffective&#8221; as they can be circumvented by children of all ages simply by lying about their age.</p>
<h2>Terms of use</h2>
<p>Another issue raised by the complaints centers on a claim of unfair terms of use &#8212; including in relation to copyright, with BEUC noting that TikTok&#8217;s T&amp;Cs give it an &#8220;irrevocable right to use, distribute and reproduce the videos published by users, without remuneration&#8221;.</p>
<p>A virtual currency feature it offers is also highlighted as problematic in consumer rights terms.</p>
<p>TikTok lets users purchase digital coins which they can use to buy virtual gifts for other users (which can in turn be converted by the user back to fiat). But BEUC says its &#8216;Virtual Item Policy’ contains &#8220;unfair terms and misleading practices&#8221; &#8212; pointing to how it claims an &#8220;absolute right&#8221; to modify the exchange rate between the coins and the gifts, thereby &#8220;potentially skewing the financial transaction in its own favour&#8221;.</p>
<p>While TikTok displays the price to buy packs of its virtual coins there is no clarity over the process it applies for the conversion of these gifts into in-app diamonds (which the gift-receiving user can choose to redeem for actual money, remitted to them via PayPal or another third party payment processing tool).</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of the final monetary compensation that is ultimately earned by the content provider remains obscure,&#8221; BEUC writes in the report, adding: &#8220;According to TikTok, the compensation is calculated &#8216;based on various factors including the number of diamonds that the user has accrued&#8217;&#8230; TikTok does not indicate how much the app retains when content providers decide to convert their diamonds into cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Playful at a first glance, TikTok’s Virtual Item Policy is highly problematic from the point of view of consumer rights,&#8221; it adds.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok found to have tracked Android users&#8217; MAC addresses until late last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/tiktok-found-to-have-tracked-android-users-mac-addresses-until-late-last-year/embed/#?secret=ZBNAkjXUyQ" data-secret="ZBNAkjXUyQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>On data protection and privacy, the social media platform is also accused of a whole litany of &#8220;misleading&#8221; practices &#8212; including (again) in relation to children. Here the complaint accuses TikTok of failing to clearly inform users about what personal data is collected, for what purpose, and for what legal reason &#8212; as is required under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Other issues flagged in the report include the lack of any opt-out from personal data being processed for advertising (aka &#8216;forced consent&#8217; &#8212; something tech giants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">Facebook and Google have also been accused</a>); the lack of explicit consent for processing sensitive personal data (which has special protections under GDPR); and an absence of security and data protection by design, among other issues.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which is TikTok&#8217;s lead supervisor for data protection issues in the EU, about the complaint and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s data watchdog, the CNIL, already opened an investigation into TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/tiktok-is-being-investigated-by-frances-data-watchdog/">last year</a> &#8212; prior to the company shifting its regional legal base to Ireland (meaning data protection complaints must now be funnelled through the Irish DPC as a result of via the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism &#8212; adding to the regulatory backlog).</p>

<p>Jef Ausloos, a postdoc researcher who worked on the legal analysis of TikTok&#8217;s privacy policy for the data protection complaints, told TechCrunch researchers had been ready to file data protection complaints a year ago &#8212; at a time when the platform had no age check at all &#8212; but it suddenly made major changes to how it operates.</p>
<p>Ausloos suggests such sudden massive shifts are a deliberate tactic to evade regulatory scrutiny of data-exploiting practices &#8212; as &#8220;constant flux&#8221; can have the effect of derailing and/or resetting research work being undertaken to build a case for enforcement &#8212; also pointing out that resource-strapped regulators may be reluctant to bring cases against companies &#8216;after the fact&#8217; (i.e. if they&#8217;ve since changed a practice).</p>
<p>The upshot of breaches that iterate is that repeat violations of the law may never be enforced.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s a clear strategy of big tech companies that built their business model on data exploitation, to remain in constant flux, rendering it hard/impossible for cases against them to crystallise and gain momentum</p>
<p>&mdash; Jef Ausloos (@Jausl00s) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jausl00s/status/1361596465378959361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also true that a frequent refrain of platforms at the point of being called out (or called up) on specific business practices is to claim they&#8217;ve since changed how they operate &#8212; seeking to use that a defence to limit the impact of regulatory enforcement or indeed a legal ruling. (Aka: &#8216;Move fast and break regulatory accountability&#8217;.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ausloos says the complainants&#8217; hope now is that the two years of documentation undertaken on the TikTok case will help DPAs build cases.</p>
<p>Commenting on the complaints in a statement, Monique Goyens, DG of BEUC, said: “In just a few years, TikTok has become one of the most popular social media apps with millions of users across Europe. But TikTok is letting its users down by breaching their rights on a massive scale. We have discovered a whole series of consumer rights infringements and therefore filed a complaint against TikTok.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children love TikTok but the company fails to keep them protected. We do not want our youngest ones to be exposed to pervasive hidden advertising and unknowingly turned into billboards when they are just trying to have fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with our members &#8212; consumer groups from across Europe &#8212; we urge authorities to take swift action. They must act now to make sure TikTok is a place where consumers, especially children, can enjoy themselves without being deprived of their rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the complaints, a TikTok spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keeping our community safe, especially our younger users, and complying with the laws where we operate are responsibilities we take incredibly seriously. Every day we work hard to protect our community which is why we have taken a range of major steps, including making all accounts belonging to users under 16 private by default. We&#8217;ve also developed an in-app summary of our Privacy Policy with vocabulary and a tone of voice that makes it easier for teens to understand our approach to privacy. We&#8217;re always open to hearing how we can improve, and we have contacted BEUC as we would welcome a meeting to listen to their concerns.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most small businesses, which form the backbone of an economy, today don&#8217;t have the resources to handle their IT needs. Take restaurants, for an example. They have likely outsourced this job to contract IT professionals to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>Every time they need to buy a point-of-sale machine, a printer, new computers, or assign business emails to employees, they reach out to a trusted IT advisor, who then works with vendor partners to secure products and services that the business needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;SMBs are often so focused on helping customers that they end up strapped for time to select the right technology that suits their business needs. Increasingly, more and more IT channel partners are assuming the role of trusted advisors to these SMBs for their technology needs,&#8221; said Shruti Ghatge, co-founder and chief executive of <a href="https://www.zomentum.com/">Zomentum</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These IT advisors play an immensely crucial role in helping companies with their sale. For even giants like Microsoft, it&#8217;s the reseller partners who <a href="https://wire19.com/microsoft-commercial-revenue-flows-through-partners/">drive much of their sales</a>. But these professionals are still using legacy tools.</p>
<p>Ghatge, who earlier worked as an investor at Accel, spotted an opportunity in this space and is tackling it with her new startup <a href="https://www.zomentum.com/">Zomentum</a>. The U.S.-headquartered startup&#8217;s platform allows IT partners to bring their entire sales process together, a phenomenon she said is helping them increase their revenue and close more sales in less time.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, three-year-old Zomentum, which aims to build a strong IT partner network that can serve as an effective sales channel to promote the hyperlocal IT market, said <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">it has raised $13 million in its Series A round from Elevation Capital and Accel (existing investors), and Greenoaks Capital. The new round, which brings Zomentum&#8217;s to-date raise to $17.1 million, also saw participation from Eight Roads Ventures.</span></p>
<p>Citing internal research, Zomentum said average IT partners on its platform are able to create documents 70% faster, close twice as many deals with a 600% increase in deal value, and are seeing 2X increase in conversion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see an opportunity to leverage the power of AI and data science to enable business insights for these channel partners. We want our partners and their clients to leverage AI-enabled Business Intelligence to help gain actionable insights and take smart decisions, something that until now, was available only to enterprises,&#8221; said Rahil Shah, co-founder and chief technology officer of Zomentum, in a statement.</p>
<p>More than 80% of Zomentum customers today are in the U.S., and Ghatge said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand its presence in the market and broaden its product offerings with features such as vCIO, QBR, assessments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pandemic and the world&#8217;s big shift to doing (even) more online has put an unprecedented amount of pressure on cybersecurity. Now, it looks like one of the big public players in that space, <a href="http://paloaltonetworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palo Alto Networks</a>, has made an acquisition that will help it address that challenge, specifically with security tools designed for those working in DevOps to handle vast volumes of security data more efficiently.</p>
<p>According to our sources and reports, the company is acquiring <a href="http://bridgecrew.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridgecrew</a>, a startup out of Israel that automates the process of network monitoring and security remediation by translating the feedback into code. Its tools are used by fast-scaling, internet-based businesses like Robinhood, BetterHelp and OneMain Financial.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition was first rumored <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3890890,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> in Israeli press as a deal worth more than $100 million. Two sources confirmed the talks to us at the time but said the deal had not yet been closed. Then, a report this morning in Israel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3894051,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calcalist</a> said the acquisition is now valued at around $200 million, possibly more if you count earn-outs.</p>
<p>Sources close to the startup&#8217;s investors confirm to us that the papers have indeed now been signed on the deal, so expect an official announcement soon, possibly in about a week.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for both companies previously declined to comment on any deal when we asked earlier this month. We are reaching out to both again.</p>
<p>A $200 million price tag would represent a strong return for Bridgecrew and its investors.</p>
<p>The startup, backed by the likes of Battery Ventures, Operator Partners and <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/399506-86/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen others</a>, has only raised around $18 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/bridgecrew-announces-14m-series-a-to-automate-cloud-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $14 million last year</a>. According to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/399506-86/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>, Bridgecrew had a valuation of about $40 million at the time of that last round.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity &#8212; specifically the need for better and more sophisticated solutions in the face of an increasing amount of breaches in an ever-growing threat landscape &#8212; has seen an increasing focus for years. Indeed, it&#8217;s one of the rising tides that has lifted Palo Alto Networks&#8217; boat.</p>
<p>But in the last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought more attention to cybersecurity and the need for more automation in it than ever before.</p>
<p>The reason is fairly obvious but is worth repeating: as more organizations migrate operations into distributed, digital-only, cloud-based environments, architectures have become more fragmented, complex and simply bigger and more of an exploitation target.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s presented a challenge for those provisioning security for these operations, and that has led to a new wave of companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/06/process-as-code-security-ops-orchestration-for-a-brave-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the last several years</a> building automated solutions, merging DevOps with security monitoring.</p>
<p>“We founded Bridgecrew because we saw that there was a huge bottleneck in security engineering, in DevSecOps, and how engineers were running cloud infrastructure security,” Bridgecrew CEO and co-founder Idan Tendler told TechCrunch last year. Others in this wider space include PortShift (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Cisco last year</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/accel-index-back-tines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tines</a> and many others.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks has <em>also</em> been building its own tools for DevOps security, namely with Prisma, which it introduced in 2019 and <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2020/palo-alto-networks-announces-prisma-cloud-2-0--the-industry-s-only-comprehensive-cloud-native-security-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated last year</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Palo Alto would choose to supplement that with an outside acquisition, but it&#8217;s notable that Bridgecrew focuses on DevOps security specifically and it has seen a lot of traction in that area.</p>
<p>Its sweet spot appears to be customers who are building huge businesses themselves on cloud infrastructure and are using automation as part of bigger efforts to ensure better cybersecurity practices.</p>
<p>It counts customers like Databricks for its <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagship</a> Bridgecrew platform product, which provides security scanning and remediation in the form of code across a wide range of infrastructure environments. The company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bridgecrew-celebrates-significant-growth-milestones-in-its-first-year-of-codified-cloud-security-301212217.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that its customer base and monthly sign ups both tripled in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>It has also seen a lot of pick-up of <a href="https://www.checkov.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkov</a>, its open source infrastrcuture-as-code (IaC) scanner that it says works across cloud infrastructure in Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Arm templates or Serverless Framework to detect misconfigurations.</p>
<p>Checkov passed a milestone of 1 million downloads last quarter, speaking to the company&#8217;s reputation and traction with the very customers that Palo Alto is looking to reach.</p>
<p>Notably, Bridgecrew says it&#8217;s working on other open source projects, so that could also be a focus for Palo Alto here.</p>
<p>Another takeaway from this news is how Israel continues to be fertile ground for hatching and growing cybersecurity businesses.</p>
<p>“Palo Alto Networks was established by Israeli founders, and Bridgecrew will be the seventh Israeli cybersecurity company acquired by Palo Alto in the recent years,&#8221; said Avihai Michaeli, a Tel Aviv-based senior investment banker and startup advisor.</p>
<p>We will update this story as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, knows a thing or two about communities. At the Chinese smartphone maker, Pei fielded product and feature ideas from fans and held frequent gatherings to hear their feedback. At his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/oneplus-co-founder-carl-pei-raises-7-million-for-his-new-venture/">new venture, Nothing</a>, Pei is going a step further.</p>
<p>London-headquartered firm said on Tuesday it will allow its community to invest $1.5 million in the company through a <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/explore/investor-terms">community equity round</a> early next month. One community member will be elected to Nothing’s board of directors to always keep the firm in “check” and remind it of ‘what users want,” said Pei.</p>
<p>The startup, which recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/alphabet-s-vc-arm-backs-oneplus-co-founder-s-nothing-company">raised a $15 million</a> Series A round from Alphabet’s GV, said it will raise money from the community at the same valuation as implied in the Series A round. (The startup has raised an additional $7 million from high-profile executives including Kunal Shah of Cred, Tony Fadell, principal at Future Shape and inventor of the iPod, well-known YouTuber Casey Neistat, Kevin Lin, co-founder of Twitch, and Steve Huffman, chief executive of Reddit.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We want our community to be part of our journey from the very start and play an active role in it.” said Pei, who serves as the chief executive of Nothing. Pre-registrations to the financing option will open on February 16 at 10AM GMT, and the campaign will go live on March 2 at 10AM GMT.</p>
<p>Pei has yet to share what all products he wants to tackle at his new venture. So far he has said the startup plans to develop a pair of wireless headphones and smart and connected consumer electronics devices.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked him why he couldn’t do all of this at OnePlus. “When you want to build something new and different, the best way is to start-off on a clean sheet and with a change of environment,” he said.</p>
<p>This week, 9to5Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/">reported</a> that Nothing had acquired some trademarks from Android creator Andy Rubin&#8217;s now-defunct Essential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.revent.vc">Revent</a> — a new European early stage (pre-seed to series A) venture capital fund with an ‘impact’ focus — is coming out of the gate today, and is poised to reach its target of a €50m ($60m) fund, with the first close of that already completed. Focusing on environmental and societal problems, Revent  will be looking to fund startups with both ‘purpose and profit’. Headquartered in Berlin and investing across Europe it will hone in on companies in Climate-Tech, health and wellbeing, and economic empowerment.</p>
<p>The founding partners are Otto Birnbaum, who was previously with French VC Partech, but also worked at HelloFresh; Dr. Lauren Lentz formality of McKinsey and an expert in impact measurement;  Emily Brooke MBE, founder of Beryl, a micromobiilty startup; and Henrik Grosse Hokamp who worked previously for Partech’s late-stage fund.</p>
<p>Revent&#8217;s founder LP is Benjamin Otto, managing Partner at the Otto Group. Otto is part of the influential and powerful Otto family in Hamburg, founders of the Otto Group. Benjamin Otto also backed the launch of two other German VCs, e.ventures and Project A. Other investors in the fund include Max Tayenthal (N26), Sascha Konietzke (Contentful), Verena Pausder (Fox &amp; Sheep), Luis Hanemann (e.ventures), Benjamin Roth (Urban Sports Club) and Dr. Florian Heinemann (Project A).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revent has so far made four investments: <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/en-EU/">Tomorrow Bank</a>, a sustainable challenger bank based in Hamburg ; <a href="https://www.sylvera.io/">Sylvera</a>, a London-based company that developed AI-enabled monitoring of nature-based carbon offsetting projects; <a href="https://www.tmrow.com/">Tmrow</a>, a Denmark-based team building technology products for consumers and companies to understand and reduce their carbon footprint; and <a href="https://www.netpurpose.com/">net purpose</a>, an impact datastream for asset managers to understand the quantitative net impact of their portfolio, acting like a “Bloomberg” terminal of impact.<br />
 <br />
Commenting on the launch, Otto Birnbaum, Revent General Partner said: &#8220;We’re not acting as philanthropists, but rather aim to demonstrate that achieving very attractive financial returns is possible precisely because of the positive impact these companies will achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin Otto, Revent Anchor Investor said: “Social and ecological challenges have reached a new level of urgency. We depend on entrepreneurial innovation to find new solutions. With Revent, we want to create a platform for founders that not only provides them with optimal support but also contributes to a change in mindset: Entrepreneurial success and social-ecological impact can reinforce each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Brooke and Lentz said the “purpose economy” has been accelerated by the Covid pandemic, which has amplified many of the planet&#8217;s systemic problems, such as inequality of access to healthcare, EdTech, creating massive changes in the world of work. Their mission, they tell me, is to positively affect the lives of 1 million people and to abate 5 million tons of C02. In order to achieve this, the fund will link fund carry to its impact goals.</p>
<p>They also say they are seeing a new wave of founders who want to tackle these problems. While overall VC investment is up only by about 2%, investment in ‘impact’ spaces such as ed-tech and mental health is booming.</p>
<p>As Brooke told me on a call: “We want to build a new version of venture capital, that authentically and genuinely prioritizes environmental returns and societal returns, along with commercial.”</p>
<p>Lentz said: “We think that there is this generation of founders who are looking for an investor who really brings both financing and an impact mindset. So not a classical impact-first impact investor, or a classic VC that is only looking at the growth trajectory and the financial upside returns. And we think that this founder is looking for an investor who really believes that these two things reinforce each other, and that the returns are going to be generated by positive societal impact, and that there needs to be a European home for this kind of founder.”</p>
<p>The main question is, how are they going to measure the impact?</p>
<p>Lentz said: “We view this holistically, and we start very early, so when we&#8217;re in diligence we go through a structured process of basically trying to assess the team, the founder DNA, how committed are they to achieving positive impact. We&#8217;re investing very early, usually pre-product, so we need to understand what is the motivation for this team. And then we try to systemically look at the different dimensions of impacts or how deep the impact, how many people will they reach, what additionality are they offering. We go through a structured exercise during the due diligence. And then we do something a bit unique which is we do an impact forecast. And so before we pull the trigger and invest we basically take what the founders have told us, and what we have learned through our conversations about possible growth trajectories, and we try to make some estimates and assumptions around the depth of the impact that the company will have. So it might be how much carbon do we think that the company will be able to beat or avert over the next eight years, or how many lives would they be able to significantly affect and to what extent&#8230; We&#8217;re not building a 20,000 line model, but we are trying to put some rigour around what we expect to happen on the impact side. Only if we anticipate that the company is going to have very significant potential upside from a commercial point of view and also very significant impact upside would we invest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fronted.rent/">Fronted</a>, the London-based fintech aiming to make life easier for renters, including lending the cash needed for a deposit, has finally launched.</p>
<p>In March, its founders took the decision to &#8220;hibernate&#8221; the nascent business after the first lockdown and with the pandemic taking hold. But, now with regulatory approval from the FCA and rents falling in London, the startup is officially opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of great momentum and then when lockdown came it was like getting headshot from across the map,&#8221; Fronted co-founder and CEO Jamie Campbell tells me. &#8220;It was when we heard that people weren&#8217;t able to move [that] we knew it would be impossible to find early testers for the product and that is when we decided to look at different options. We knew lockdown would delay launching and the furlough scheme gave us options and time. In the end, it was an easy decision and, looking back, it was the right one&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Campbell, Simon Vans-Colina and Anthony Mann — former employees at Bud, Monzo and Apple, respectively — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/">backed by Passion Capital</a>, Fronted is using open banking and other financial technology to offer a credit product designed to finance deposits directly. The pitch is that Fronted can lend more cheaply than existing options, such as credit cards, pay-day lenders and overdrafts, or insurance-backed membership schemes. And, crucially, at lower risk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JW61pl2sec"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/">Passion Capital has backed Fronted, the startup that wants to offer loans to cover rent deposits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Passion Capital has backed Fronted, the startup that wants to offer loans to cover rent deposits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/embed/#?secret=JW61pl2sec" data-secret="JW61pl2sec" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Renting sucks — anyone who rents knows it,” Campbell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/fronted/">told me last year</a>. “There are so many problems to solve and we intend to tackle them all bit by bit. But first, we are going to pay people’s rent deposits for them so they can pay us back in bite-size manageable amounts&#8221;.</p>
<p>To be able to apply for a Fronted rental deposit loan, you&#8217;ll need to be U.K. citizen, have a bank account with more than six months of transaction data and minimum income of £12,000. You are then asked to securely link your bank account data to Fronted via open banking, in order to assess your affordability beyond a simple credit score.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe [this] is a fairer way to determine whether or not someone qualifies for a deposit from us,&#8221; explains Campbell. &#8220;We are confident we are launching with a fair approach. We don&#8217;t, for instance, turn people away who are on benefits or furloughed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fronted loans last 12 months and carry a 12.5% interest rate. However, there are no early repayment fees. Once a loan is agreed, the startup sends the money directly to the estate agent to be placed in the U.K.’s Deposit Protection Scheme, meaning that the loan never touches the renter’s hands (or wallet).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the timing looks good. Fronted says that 60% of all renters have no savings and are therefore not in a great position to move. Meanwhile, rents are falling as much as 12% in London, meaning that renters could save huge amounts of money simply by moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deposits are a huge impediment to social mobility; the amount of people who don’t move because they don’t have the money on hand is staggering,&#8221; adds the Fronted CEO, noting customers don&#8217;t just include those that have already found a place, but also those who are still looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who haven&#8217;t found a place, they are coming to us to see what deposit they could get and then going to find a property&#8230; For those people, we give them a maximum which is valid for 30 days so they can shop around knowing they have Fronted in their back pocket&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many countries hit hard by Covid-19 are beginning to see a glimmer of optimism from the arrival of vaccinations. Now, a promising travel startup that saw its growth arrested by the arrival and persistence of the pandemic is announcing a $97 million financing facility to help it stay the course until it can finally resume normal business.</p>
<p><a href="http://getyourguide.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourGuide</a>, the Berlin startup that curates, organizes and lets travelers and others book tours and other experiences, has secured a revolving credit facility of €80 million ($97 million at current rates). The financing is being led by UniCredit, with CitiGroup, Silicon Valley Bank, Deutsche Bank and KfW also participating.</p>
<p>CFO Nils Chrestin said in an interview that the funding will let GetYourGuide come &#8220;sprinting out of the gates&#8221; when consumers are in a better position to enjoy travel experiences again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">The capital could be used potentially for normal business expenses, for acquisitions or investments, or other strategic initiatives, such as more investment into the company&#8217;s in-house Originals tour operations or new services to book last-minute experiences, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">And even if a lot of tourism has really slowed down, there are still people taking short-distance trips or buying activities in the cities where they live (and are not leaving). While some metro areas like London are essentially only open for booking well in advance (when the hope is lockdown restrictions might be eased), other cities like Rome or Amsterdam have activities available for booking today.</span></p>
<p>GetYourGuide&#8217;s latest financing news underscores how some startups &#8212; specifically those whose business models have <em>not</em> lended themselves well to pandemic living &#8212; are getting more creative with their approaches to staying afloat.</p>
<p>GetYourGuide has raised more than $600 million in equity capital since 2009, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/getyourguide-picks-up-484m-passes-25m-tickets-sold-through-its-tourism-activity-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $484 million in 2019</a> (before the pandemic) valuing it at well over $1 billion.</p>
<p>But more recently, the startup backed by the likes of SoftBank, Temasek, Lakestar, and others has been shoring up its position with alternative forms of finance.</p>
<p>In October, GetYourGuide closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convertible note of $133 million</a>. While it has yet to raise the equity round that would covert that note &#8212; it could be up to 18 months before another equity round is closed, CEO and co-founder Johannes Reck told me at the time &#8212; this latest revolving debt facility is giving the startup another efficient route to accessing money.</p>
<p>Unlike equity rounds (or notes that can convert into equity), revolving debt facilities are non-dilutive, flexible lines of credit, where companies can quickly draw down funds as needed up to the full value of the facility. After repaying with interest, they can re-draw up to the same limit again.</p>
<p>In that regard, revolving debt facilities are not unlike credit cards for consumers, and similarly, they are a sign of how banks rate GetYourGuide, and perhaps the travel industry more generally, as strong candidates for paying back, and eventually bouncing back.</p>
<p>“We are very happy to help GetYourGuide continue its growth trajectory during this extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in”, says Jan Kupfer, head of corporate and investment banking, Germany, at UniCredit, in a statement. “The successful financing also shows once again our unique tech advisory approach, where we combine our deep tech expertise with the broad product range of a pan-European commercial bank.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary situation&#8221; is perhaps an understatement for the rough year that travel businesses have had.</p>
<p>There do remain parts of the industry that have yet to make the leap to digital platforms &#8212; experiences, the focus of GetYourGuide, is very much one of them &#8212; and that makes for very interesting and potentially big businesses.</p>
<p>But between government-imposed travel restrictions, and people reluctant to venture far, or mix and mingle with others, startups like GetYourGuide have essentially found themselves treading water until things get moving again.</p>
<p>Last October, GetYourGuide said it had passed 45 million ticket sales in aggregate on its platform, but that figure was only up by 5 million in 10 months. As we pointed out at the time, that speaks both to a major slowdown in growth and to the struggles that companies like it are facing, and it is very likely far from the projections the startup had originally made for its expansion before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only one: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/covid-19-and-the-aviation-industry-impact-and-policy-responses-26d521c1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">air travel</a>, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/pwc-hotels-forecast--covid-19-pandemic-prompts-most-volatile-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotels</a>, and other sectors that fall into the travel and tourism industries have largely been stagnating or in freefall or decline this year. Many believe that those who will be left standing after all of this will have to collectively brace themselves for potentially years of financial turmoil to come back from it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Airbnb presents an alternative reality, at least for the moment. It appears to have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABNB?p=ABNB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captured investors&#8217; attention</a> and since going public in December has been on a steady upswing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/02/15/why-airbnb-stocks-rally-isnt-justified/?sh=290112291f32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analysts</a> may say that there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of news coming out about the company to merit that rise, but one explanation has been that the optimism has more to do with its longer-term potential and for how tech-savvy routes to filling travel needs will indeed be the services that people will use before the rest.</p>
<p>That could be part of the pitch for GetYouGuide, too. Chrestin said that the company believes that travel in the U.S. market, a key region for the startup, is looking like it might rebound in Q2 or Q3. Yet even if it doesn&#8217;t, the company has the runway to wait longer.</p>
<p class="p1">Chrestin noted that GetYourGuide has &#8220;reinvented internal processes&#8221; and is operating much more efficiently now. &#8220;If it weren’t for the global hardship this crisis is causing, we would look back and say it was quite transformational,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The company is very well capitalized and fully funded to profitability. Even if the current travel volume stayed like this for three years, we would not run out of capital,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We have sufficient capital even for that scenario, but we don’t think that will happen.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="7to42" data-offset-key="cov6h-0-0">
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://en.uncoveredfund.com/">Uncovered Fund</a>, a VC firm targeting early-stage startups in Africa, announced today that it has launched its $15 million fund which is expected to close at the end of June this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tokyo-based outfit founded by <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/takuma-terakubo-5a53281a1">Takuma Terakubo</a> in 2019 will invest $50,000 to $500,000 in African startups in seed and Series A stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Uncovered Fund, Terakubo was the CEO of Leapfrog Ventures. Together with Japanese startup incubator, Samurai Incubate, they launched <a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/#:~:text=Samurai%20Incubate%20Africa%20supports%20growth,innovation%20on%20the%20African%20continent.">Samurai Incubate Fund</a>; a fund focused on early-stage African startups. During his time there, the firm raised more than $4.5 million targeted at startups in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. It also financed over 10 startups with checks similar to Uncovered Fund&#8217;s ($50,000 to $500,000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terakubo doesn&#8217;t say why he left Samurai Incubate Fund. But according to him, Uncovered Fund&#8217;s investment methodology is different from his previous firm because it doesn&#8217;t bring only money to the table.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We do not make scattered, one-shot, small investments, but rather we provide long-term growth support, including follow-on investment. In addition, we not only invest, but we also multiply the huge assets of Japanese companies to grow the business and provide technical support and finance as well,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per who these corporations are, Terakubo isn’t disclosing names just yet but says he hopes to do so in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovered Fund focuses on startups based in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa playing in retail, fintech, healthtech, logistics, MaaS, agritech, and smart city sectors. The general partner says the firm invests in these sectors because &#8220;they are basic behaviors in people&#8217;s lives, and we believe it is important to improve convenience as quickly as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has backed five startups across these sectors and markets. They include Kenyan e-commerce platform, <a href="https://sky.garden/home">Sky Garden</a>; US-based and Africa-focused healthtech startup <a href="https://rxalldelivered.com/home">RxAll</a>; Francophone Africa mobility startup, <a href="https://gozem.co/en/">Gozem</a>; Kenyan fintech company <a href="https://lipalater.com/">LipaLater</a>; and YC-backed Nigerian digital freight startup, <a href="https://www.send.ng/">SEND Technologies</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies are doing business in other countries, and Terakubo says that the firm is willing to fund startups in other African countries as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking for African startups to expand their business across multiple countries. So, we welcome startups from any country as long as the business can scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovered Fund joins other Asian early-stage VC firms like <a href="http://www.fhub.io/">Future Hub</a>, <a href="https://kepple-africa-ventures.com/home_eng">Kepple Africa</a>, and recently launched <a href="https://www.sherpa.africa/">Sherpa Ventures</a> who have launched within the past four years and funded over 50 African startups during that period. Terakubo says his VC firm hopes to increase this number by backing 15 startups this year and further the synergy between African founders and Asian investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking into joint development from Africa to Asian markets, and that is the big vision we have for the future,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a VC and also an entrepreneur, I&#8217;m looking forward to the challenge of working with African entrepreneurs to create that future.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the chemical refineries that line the Gulf Coast to oilfields of West Texas, heavy industry has always been a big part of the economy in the Lone Star State.</p>
<p>Now, as venture capital moves in to the state as part of an exodus from California, a new fund is combining Texas&#8217; industrial past with its high technology future.</p>
<p>That fund is Ironspring Ventures, which has closed its first investment vehicle with $61 million nearly two years after it launched its fundraising efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fruit of a partnership between Adam Bridgman and Peter J. Holt, the co-founders of an earlier investment vehicle called Holt Ventures, and Ty Findley, a former investor at G.E. Ventures and the Pritzker Group, the firm&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;accelerate digital adoption across legacy heavy industries,&#8221; according to Bridgman.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of the Ironspring team has a long history with industrial technologies and deep roots in the Texas economy. Findley, a managing partner, grew up &#8220;in the middle of nowhere in East Texas&#8221; but comes from a family of entrepreneurs who built businesses along the Texas and Louisiana border. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I joined up with our other co-founder and managing partner, Peter Holt,&#8221; said Bridgman. &#8220;That was really step one for us pursuing this broader mission of investing in legacy industry at the early stage of digital innovation. We were fortunate to find a strong cultural alignment and rare experience with Ty [Findley]. After co-investing over a period of time we got to know each other very well. We joined forces and it&#8217;s been a nice journey over the last year-and-a-half of formally launching and formally closing the fund in December.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first deal that the three men invested in together was <a href="https://www.augmentir.com/">Augmentir</a>, a service providing information and support for remote workers. &#8220;Everything comes back to these words &#8216;digital industrial&#8217; for us,&#8221; said Findley. &#8220;There&#8217;s this massive gap where people forget that almost the majority of GDP in this country is manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Ironspring has invested in four portfolio companies, Mercado, which is developing a service to improve the import process; Icon Build, a company developing 3-D printing tools and technologies for the building industry;  FastRadius, which brings design tools and services for prototyping and industrial design; and GoContractor, a safety and compliance management service.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s average check size is around $2.5 million and investments will range from $1 million on the low end to $4 million on the high end, according to the firm&#8217;s partners. That means looking for what the firm called &#8220;post-seed&#8221; deals.</p>
<p>And the firm is looking for technology that is transforming how businesses design products, build them, and provide services and operate across the wide range of industrial output.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to organize around those themes,&#8221; said Bridgman. </span></p>
