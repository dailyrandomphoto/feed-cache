										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the good number of hours I’ve spent researching and writing about vertical farming in recent months, one key word keeps popping up: proximity. So many of the resources spent on modern farming are devoted to transporting produce long stretches, ramping up carbon footprints in the process. Gotham Greens isn’t vertical farming, exactly, but it has become a poster child for locally grown agriculture, courtesy of its urban greenhouse that sits directly atop a Whole Foods in Gowanus Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old company currently has three New York City locations (two in Brooklyn and one in Queens), two additional farms on the East Coast (Baltimore and Providence), a pair in the Midwest (Chicago) and one in the Mountain region (Denver). Today, it announced further westward expansion with the opening of its first California greenhouse, based just outside UC Davis.</p>

<p>Gotham’s ninth location is a 10-acre farm designed to dramatically reduce the resources required to grow produce. Using its hydroponic technology, the company says it’s capable of reducing the standard 10 gallons of water required to grow a head of lettuce to less than a single gallon. Overall, it claims the farm will be able to save 270 million gallons of water a year, while occupying 300 fewer acres than traditional farming practices.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting move, heading to California, where so much of the nation’s produce is grown &#8212; and certainly a different tactic that opening a location in New York City or Chicago. Of course, in spite of California’s proud tradition of growing, the state has been plagued by the very real devastation of climate change.</p>

<p>“California is the center of North America’s leafy greens production, where water shortages, wildfires and other results of climate change are straining critical agricultural resources. By putting down roots in California, we aspire to be a part of the agricultural industry’s solution to the increasingly visible impacts of climate change,” co-founder and CEO Viraj Puri said in a release. “Our newest greenhouse facility in Northern California is strategically located to service retailers and food service providers throughout the region more quickly while conserving precious resources, including land and water.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The proximity to UCD was no mistake, either. The company will be partnering with researchers from the school and will likely have a solid pipeline of future employees. The company also used the opportunity to announce plans to reduce the plastic in its packaging 40% (versus 2020) and electricity use 5% by the year 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">Samsara IPO heading toward pricing</a>, it&#8217;s a good moment to spend a little more time digging into the IoT market. There&#8217;s a lot more going on than merely the liquidity point of one of its players, it turns out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.afero.io/">Afero</a>, for example, closed a $50 million Series C today, led by <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/">Crosspoint Capital Partners</a>. The new capital raise is roughly equivalent to all the capital that Afero raised prior to its latest round, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/afero/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, implying that the startup now has more cash on hand than at any point prior.</p>
<p>After being slightly surprised at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">how large Samsara&#8217;s own IoT-focused business had grown</a> while we weren&#8217;t watching, TechCrunch got ahold of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-britt">Afero CEO Joe Britt</a> and <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/team/hugh-thompson/">Crosspoint&#8217;s Hugh Thompson</a> to chat more about its business and why it chose this moment to raise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>What does Afero do?</h2>
<p>Per Britt, when his team was putting Afero together, they noted projections indicating that the number of connected devices in the world was going to scale by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Given that anticipated boom in connected gadgets, sensors and the like, Afero&#8217;s IoT platform was built with security in mind. That might sound intuitive, but Britt argues that the web was not initially compiled with security as a top priority, which has led to round after round of issues surrounding breaches and hacks.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to connect our lives and businesses to the internet on an ambient basis, security is going to be a pretty darn big deal. Else your toaster or production is going to get hacked.</p>
<p>Thompson, who has a background in security work, stressed how important that stance was to his interest in investing in the company, saying that the startup is &#8220;rare&#8221; in having &#8220;built things right [in security terms] from the very beginning.&#8221; (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker">TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker</a>, I am more aware than ever of how frequently major companies are compromised, making me sympathetic to arguments of the importance of building with a security-first mindset.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Afero&#8217;s IoT platform also includes a software development toolkit (SDK) for customer companies to build mobile apps on top of, as well as the ability to tailor itself to customer use cases.</p>
<p>In practice, the startup works with companies like Home Depot to bring connected devices to markets like the smart home segment. According to Britt and Thompson, the company&#8217;s platform can also support offline items like tagged physical goods to help track supply chains.</p>
<h2>Why raise now?</h2>
<p>Of all the startups that I have spoken to after raising a Series C, Afero is the smallest in terms of full-time staffing with just 24 people. Obviously, the company is going to do some hiring with its new capital. It also plans to invest in its go-to-market efforts &#8212; more spending on marketing, sales and so forth.</p>
<p>Asked by TechCrunch how large the company&#8217;s in-market footprint is today, Afero&#8217;s CEO declined to share a specific number, and after trying to find a way to explain general scale without being too precise, he simply said that there are &#8220;a lot&#8221; of Afero-connected devices in the world. Normally we&#8217;d complain a bit about a lack of hard numbers, but given that the startup&#8217;s customers might not want it to disclose how many of their devices sit atop Afero&#8217;s platform, it makes some sense.</p>
<p>In time, when Afero has a wider customer base, we&#8217;ll expect more specificity.</p>
<p>A few years back, we might have been skeptical of the scale of the market that Afero is tackling, but Samsara&#8217;s growth changed our general perspective.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be public company&#8217;s platform collects IoT data from real-world business operations, allowing for the creation of an application layer atop data sourced from sensors. Samsara&#8217;s revenues of $113.8 million last quarter provide proof of market demand for IoT platforms more generally.</p>
<p>Afero&#8217;s best-known partnership has more of a consumer flavor &#8212; Home Depot&#8217;s HubSpace line is geared toward the public &#8212; than what Samsara has built, so the two are not direct competitors today. We&#8217;re not trying to say that Afero is coming after Samsara or the other way around. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;ll be curious to see how many new customer companies Afero can land in the next few quarters &#8212; and how soon it will scale to the point that it&#8217;s comfortable sharing harder metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> is a company that works directly with developers, so having an in-house investment arm that helps these developers who are building companies on top of Twilio, makes a lot of sense. Today the communications API company announced the launch of <a href="http://www.twilio.com/ventures">Twilio Ventures</a>, a $50 million fund created to invest in companies using Twilio or who are working on innovative adjacent ideas.</p>
<p>Bryan Vaniman, senior vice president of corporate development, who is in charge of the new investment arm, came over from Adobe in March with a mission to build a fund and start investing. He says that having a funding mechanism like this, which many companies do, is a natural extension of the mission of the company to empower developers with tools to build applications faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about championing developers and startups that are building the next generation of customer engagement applications. We just think it&#8217;s a really natural extension of what we do being a developer-first company from the outset,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company has shifted to customer-oriented applications with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/"> the $3.2 billion acquisition of Segment</a> last year, customer experience has become a big part of the focus for Twilio Ventures as they look for companies to fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, we see this as an opportunity to expand our reach and impacts within that ecosystem by supporting exciting companies that are building the next generation of capabilities for developers and customer engagement applications,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will typically invest in Series A rounds, but will go later or earlier if the company is a good match, he said. Typically the checks are in the $1M to $3M range.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244530" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244530" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Companies that Twilio Ventures has invested in." width="680" height="210" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?resize=150,46 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?resize=768,237 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?resize=680,210 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-07-at-5.04.19-PM.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twilio</p></div></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve already invested in several companies that have a lot in common with Twilio, as you would expect. &#8220;If you look at the handful of investments we&#8217;ve made, <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> is a great example of a company that shares a very similar developer personal ethos to us. They&#8217;ve developed a set of API&#8217;s that enable developers to build amazing kinds of search recommendation experiences,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although they aren&#8217;t able to share exact investment amounts with these companies, he says that they are secondary strategic investors. The plan is to act as helpful partners and offer these companies access to internal resources and help with sales and marketing, but they will not have a board seat in most cases.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s possible that they could consider acquiring some of the companies that they are investing in, that is not the primary goal of the fund. &#8220;That would be more of an ancillary benefit. It&#8217;s not the primary rationale for the program, but the benefit of investing and getting closer to companies and building relationships is that there&#8217;s potential for that to lead to a deeper relationship down the road, but that would not be the primary focus,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other SaaS companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-private-investment-cools-enterprise-startups-may-try-tapping-corporate-dollars/">take a similar approach</a> building an investment arm including Salesforce, Zoom, Hubspot, Workday and Okta.</p>

That’s up from a $2 billion valuation at the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million Series E round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Tipalti uses artificial intelligence to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help businesses manage suppliers, invoices, purchase orders, tax compliance, payments and billing and other accounting services from a single cloud platform. It claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce companies’ operational workload by 80% by giving them the ability to pay partners and vendors in “within minutes.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244637" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, the company is focused on mid-market businesses, which are defined as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. alone, mid-market companies acco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unt for </span><a href="https://www.middlemarketcenter.org/ncmm-annual-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a third of employment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://rsmus.com/economics.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 40 percent of GDP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another large player in the space, Bill.com, is focused more on SMBs. That company went public in December 2019 and is currently trading at $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">254.76</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, significantly higher than the $22 a share it priced its shares at the time of its IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the market has a proper appreciation for the size of market opportunity we’re facing,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and co-founder Chen Amit. “Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiples over the last 12 months have increased because of that new appreciation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">G-Squared led Tipalti’s latest round, which also included “significant” investments from new backers Marshall Wace as well as funds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), in addition to current investors Zeev Ventures, Durable Capital Partners, 01 Advisors and others. The financing brings the company’s total raised since its 2010 inception to $550 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti’s new valuation &#8212; more than quadruple that of its last &#8212; catapults the San Mateo, California-based startup to among the most valuable private fintech companies in the world, according to </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-250-startups-most-promising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB Insights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has it done to warrant such a jump? A few things, according to Amit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, it currently processes over $30 billion in total annual payments volume — growing 120% year over year. It also recently passed the 2,000 customer mark. Those customers include Roblox, Amazon Twitch, GoDaddy, Roku, WordPress.com and ZipRecruiter, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, at the time of its Series E raise in October 2020, Tipalti said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it had seen transaction volume on its platform balloon to $12 billion, up 80% from the year prior. It then had some 1,000 customers on its books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year, Tipalti opened new offices in London, Plano, Texas, and Toronto Ontario, and has grown to 720 employees worldwide compared to 350 last year. It also launched “enhanced capabilities,” including the </span><a href="https://tipalti.com/pr20210412/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition and integration of cloud procurement solutions provider Approve.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enhanced multi-entity AP capabilities, virtual cards, mobile and added new integrations with complementary financial tech stack providers such as expense management companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s just the beginning, according to Amit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This latest investment will enable Tipalti to add more to our product lines and capabilities in the next 18 months than we have over the past 10 years combined,” he said. “The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broader challenge of financial operations for high growth and mid-market companies encompasses many problems and challenges they have and that creates more opportunity for us to monetize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti will also use its new capital in part on customer operations, as well as toward a global expansion. It also plans to hire across its product, engineer and sales and marketing teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect to double our go-to-market team next year,” Amit told TechCrunch. “The addressable market we have today is around 700,000 companies with very little penetration between us and the few other players in the market. So we want to reachout to more of these prospects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Aschebrook, founder &amp; managing partner of G Squared, said in a written statement that his firm believes that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti is reshaping how businesses manage their financial operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their growth and industry-leading retention rates are evidence that they are on a mission to solve important challenges for their customers,” Aschebrook added. “We see a huge opportunity in the target market that is largely underserved currently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti has approached a complex and often low-tech set of essential business processes and “meticulously crafted a solution with simplicity at its core.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bird, the shared micromobility company that recently went public by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">merging with a special purpose acquisition company</a>, has launched two new kick scooters for sale. The Bird Flex, a foldable personal e-scooter costing $599, and the Birdie Glow, a three-wheel scooter for kids that costs $99, will add to the company&#8217;s small but growing suite of consumer micromobility vehicles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These two new scooters, along with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">Bird Bike the company launched back in August</a>, will be available for direct-to-consumer purchases or through retail giant Target. The vehicles are only being sold in the U.S. at the moment, but Bird told TechCrunch it hopes to start selling the new scooters in Europe next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that vehicle sales only made up a small percentage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/">Bird&#8217;s Q3 top line revenue</a> at 2.1%, the company appears to be trying to build out its hardware sales unit at a time when sales of personal micromobility vehicles are on the rise. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/why-micromobility-is-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December McKinsey study</a> on micromobility found 70% of participants would be willing to ride a micromobility vehicle to work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Bird would not share how many retail products it has sold so far, nor how much top line revenue it expects to receive from retail sales.</p>
<div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234437" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto">“As interest in shared and personal electric vehicles grows across the country, we are continuing to expand our offerings of eco-friendly transportation products to meet the needs of riders at every age and at a variety of price points,” said Brian Buccella, SVP of consumer products and government partnerships at Bird, in a statement. “We know that people are looking to micro electric vehicles to replace gas-powered car trips to get around their cities. With a full suite of personal micromobility devices, we can help expand the reach and access to eco-friendly transportation.”</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Bird Flex, which is recommended for riders age 16 and up, follows in the footsteps of the Bird Air, Bird&#8217;s first personal electric kick scooter. The price point between them is the same, as are many metrics of the vehicles. In fact, the Flex has a marginally slower top speed at 15 miles per hour, versus Air&#8217;s 16 miles per hour, and less range at 15 miles of range, versus Air&#8217;s 16 miles of range, although a spokesperson for Bird told TechCrunch the battery is slightly larger in the Flex than the Air. Perhaps it&#8217;s the &#8220;larger and more rugged build&#8221; of the Flex that equates bigger battery to less range.</p>
<p>Flex specs include street-tested front-wheel suspension, a 350W brushless Hall motor, a wider base, longer platform and 10-inch diameter puncture-proof tires. It also comes with an integrated LED display which shows speed and battery life. The Flex is foldable, and it weighs just under 50 pounds.</p>
<p>The Birdie Glow is pretty much the same as Bird&#8217;s original Birdie, <a href="https://www.bird.co/it/blog/meet-birdie-birds-new-three-wheel-kids-scooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which the company launched in 2019</a>, except that this one has light-up wheels. That&#8217;ll get the kiddos! It&#8217;s designed for children aged three to eight, and is thankfully not electric. The Birdie Glow will initially be available in Electric Rose but will soon be available in other colors like Sky Blue, Twilight and Jet Pack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If investors complained about Wall Street 80 years ago, they’re howling now. Industry players get richer and richer, while many investors see mediocre results after fees.</p>
<p>Asset management is a highly unusual and somewhat baffling industry. Here are six main examples of just how peculiar this industry is.</p>
<h2>The asset management industry rarely delivers what it promises: Alpha</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ray-dalio-youaposre-not-going-to-produce-alpha-so-focus-on-balancing8230and-meditation-1384273971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha is a zero-sum game</a>, according to Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. By contrast, most industries are positive-sum: If you eat a great steak dinner, it doesn’t imply that others have to eat hot dogs. In asset management, each new money manager who generates alpha (returns above the passive benchmark performance) does so at the expense of other managers who underperform.</p>
<p>Your own investment’s value may change because of a change in the value of the underlying asset and/or market preferences. However, few investors can directly impact the value of the underlying asset, except for private equity and venture capital investors with portfolio acceleration strategies. Celebrity investors like George Soros can influence market preferences, but most of us don’t have that advantage.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Diversity and inclusion are the most readily solvable issues, and the inevitable aging of the &#8220;pale, male and stale&#8221; leaders of the industry will create room for new entrants.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In fact, it is mathematically impossible for the mean investor in a given sector to beat a low-cost index of that sector after expenses. We’d argue that money managers playing a positive-sum game include those who focus on well-developed sectors for which indices are not readily available (e.g., private companies, frontier markets, cryptocurrencies) and/or nascent asset classes.</p>
<p>For example, hedge funds, on average, have underperformed on a net-of-fees basis in both U.S. equities and bonds since 2000. The HFRI Index returned <a href="https://nirkaissar.com/hedge-funds-have-a-performance-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18.3%</a> annually during its initial 10 years from 1990 to 1999, but it returned just 3.4% annually over the 10 years to 2016. Similarly, according to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/shared/pdfs/Research/Active_Passive_Barometer_2020_02_.pdf?utm_source=eloqua&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=21040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer</a>, in the five years ended October 2021, only 26.4% of U.S. large cap, 22.7% of U.S. small cap and 24.3% of global large-cap active equity mutual funds outperformed their passive competitors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243256" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243256" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2243256 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png" alt="Rolling ten-year returns have steadily declined across hedge fund strategies" width="1024" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png 1253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243256" class="wp-caption-text">Rolling 10-year returns have steadily declined across hedge fund strategies. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Teten<br />Blue bar: Hedge-Fund Research Institute (HFRI) Weighted Composite Index (HFRI FWD) Aug. 2018 | (HF Annual Return %).<br />Green bar: S&amp;P 500 Return (Bloomberg).<br />Blue line: Barclays Hedge AUM Hedge-Fund Industry; 2017 | (Hedge Fund Industry AUM $TN).</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Given better analytics, institutional investors have realized that there is little alpha and much of the excess returns are explained by risk premia,” Nicolas Rabener, managing director of FactorResearch, said.</p>
<p>Amit Matta, a risk management expert, observed that performance is often overstated (and risk understated) due to the illiquid nature of some of the underlying investments, which allows room to manipulate pricing in favorable ways.</p>
<p>However, a large group has different objectives — corporate players. &#8220;They are fully 50% of the primary market (sellers) and are material players in the secondary market (M&amp;A), which cumulatively makes the markets a positive-sum game. It&#8217;s possible for all asset managers to make money when they buy a successful IPO or sell their holding to a corporate buyer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Size often hurts returns</h2>
<p>Standard compensation models motivate money managers to add more assets under management. This contributes to the &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; trend, where we see a steadily growing concentration of AUM at the largest money managers. The argument is that large hedge funds have the resources and talent to beat markets. The reality is far from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More capital </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/lee-sec-speaks-2021-10-12#_ftn1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the private markets than the public markets for over a decade, and this staggering growth has shown no signs of slowing. As private investment booms, companies are developing new tools to help investors navigate these markets, which can be opaque and inconsistent when it comes to reporting performance data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based <a href="https://archlabs.com/">Arch</a> has entered the fray with $5.5 million in fresh seed funding for its aggregated private investment management platform, the company announced on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244265" style="width: 1232px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244265 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png" alt="Arch's task and tax management functions" width="1222" height="727" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png 2988w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=768,457 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=1536,914 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=2048,1219 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244265" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Arch&#8217;s task and tax management functions <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arch</em></p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244256" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch likens itself to investment management platform Fidelity, but for private investments. It automates “everything that isn’t advice” for investors, advisors, and accountants, co-founder and CEO Ryan Eisenman told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eisenman, who worked for an investment advisor while in college, started building Arch in early 2018 alongside his co-founders Jason Trigg and Joel Stein, both MIT-educated software engineers. They set out to aggregate information on one platform from various private investment managers, many of whom tend to have their own internally-built portals to manage data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We aggregate data from over 5000 different firms, and we can really manage any firm. We have a process that&#8217;s scalable – whether we&#8217;ve connected with them in the past, or if they&#8217;re a new firm, we can connect with them,” Eisenman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch plans to use the proceeds from the seed round to hire new talent in operations, partnerships, and engineering, with the expectation of doubling its ten-person headcount by the end of next year, Eisenman said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new hires will help support its goal of expanding its platform to support a wider base of institutional investor types, including foundations, endowments, and pension funds. It has just over 100 clients today, most of which are investment advisors and family offices, Eisenman said. Arch does not have any full-time salespeople yet, which it hopes to add with this new capital, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new firms sharing data with Arch, the onboarding process is low-touch, as the firms share the same information with Arch as they do with their clients, Eisenman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch’s clients, the investors, report spending 35% less time on average managing their investments because of the efficiencies the platform provides by displaying information like company updates, tax information, capital calls, and cash flows all in one place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a ton of things that investors no longer need to do [with Arch]. They no longer need to log into a portal, pull down a document, file the document, make sense of it, pull data from the document, potentially put data into systems – all of that is fully automated for them,” Eisenman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of getting tens, or sometimes hundreds, of emails, they get one email every day that summarizes all the actions they need to take and all the other information that&#8217;s come in, and then gives them direct links to that information into the documents themselves,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244268" style="width: 1232px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?w=300" alt="Arch's consolidated invest" width="1222" height="549" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png 3914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=1536,691 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=2048,921 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244268" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Arch&#8217;s consolidated investment portal <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arch</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch also links to wealth management platform Addepar through its transactions API, as well as other popular databases including APX and Black Diamond, allowing Arch’s clients to integrate their performance reporting across the various platforms they use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in June 2020, it has grown annualized recurring revenue (ARR) by over 1,100% and expanded its assets under management over 2,300% to $8 billion, the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.craftventures.com/">Craft Ventures</a> led the seed round alongside several prominent angels, including Warby Parker co-founders Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, Carta CEO and co-founder Henry Ward, Harry’s founder Jeff Raider, Allbirds founder Joey Zwillinger, and Doordash founder Tony Xu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Over 25 current Arch clients also participated because they understood the need for Arch&#8217;s software firsthand, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to also include people that have supported us early as clients, as investors in our last round, was something that we&#8217;re extremely proud of. We love creating situations where we can all be aligned and win together,” Eisenman said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit is launching a new personalized Spotify Wrapped-like recap feature for all users tomorrow. The new recaps will include a variety of stats, including a summary of the time you spent on the platform, a look at the content that you interacted with or contributed, topics you engaged with and communities you’ve viewed or joined. Reddit notes that users will be able to hide their username and avatar if they want when sharing the recap across other social media apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;In previous years, Reddit Recap focused on aggregated trends across the platform. This year we wanted to add a fun, personalized in-product experience to remind users of their contributions and belonging on the platform,&#8221; Reddit said in a statement. &#8220;Every Redditor has a unique role to play on Reddit, and so we referenced user browsing and engagement data from January 1st, 2021 to November 30th, 2021 to help shape the stories about how they fit in.&#8221;</p>
<p>End-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> feature that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it&#8217;s no surprise that other companies like Apple, YouTube, Snapchat and now Reddit are looking to mimic the popular feature with their own versions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to the launch of recaps, Reddit has released data about the most popular themes on the platform in 2021. The company notes that cryptocurrency, gaming, sports, weddings, health and fitness, food and drink, and movies and television were the most popular categories. In terms of cryptocurrency, the top five most-viewed crypto communities this year were r/dogecoin, r/superstonk. r/cryptocurrency, r/amcstock and r/bitcoin. So far this year, Reddit has seen 6.6 million mentions of &#8220;crypto&#8221; across its platform.</p>
<p>As for gaming, the top five most viewed communities in 2021 were r/genshinimpact, r/leagueoflegends, r/gaming, r/rpclipsgta and r/ffxiv. For the sports category, the top five communities were r/nba, r/soccer, r/nfl, r/squaredcircle and r/mma. In terms of the weddings category, the top five communities were r/weddingplanning, r/engagementrings, r/bridezillas, r/wedding and r/weddingsunder10k.</p>
<p>Regarding health and fitness, the top five communities were r/lifeprotips, r/sports, r/progresspics, r/fitness and r/loseit. As for the food and drink category, the top five were r/food, r/cooking, r/keto, r/kitchenconfidential and r/starbucks. Lastly, the top five communities in the movies and television category were r/movies, r/marvelstudios, r/starwars, r/moviedetails and r/dc_cinematic.</p>
<p>Reddit also revealed that users created 366 million posts in 2021, which is a 19% year-over-year increase. The company has seen 2.3 billion total comments, a 12 percent increase year-over-year and 46 billion total upvotes, a 1% increase year-over-year so far this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2009, <a href="https://intellihot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intellihot</a> has been on a mission to make commercial buildings more efficient, by improving the cost and physical footprint of keeping building H<sub>2</sub>O nice and toasty. The company just announced it raised $50 million to shake up the $81 billionn global HVAC market, with plans to expand internationally. The round was led by <span style="font-weight: 400;">investors </span><a href="https://www.aegonam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegon Asset Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.avenuecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>When you walk into an office building, you see security guards, fancy company plaques on the walls and, around this time of year, you may see a Christmas tree or two. What you don&#8217;t see is what happens deep in the bowels of a building, and if you&#8217;ve never paused to think about the vast amount of magic that happens under the floors, in the walls and along the ceilings of a building, you&#8217;ve probably not thought about what an incredibly complex creature a modern office building can be. Apart from the immediately obvious &#8212; electricity, internet and an endless and deeply necessary supply of caffeinated hot beverages &#8212; buildings need hot water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paradoxically, hot water access is everywhere, necessary and yet easy to overlook — until you don’t have it anymore. Intellihot has recognized the enormous opportunity at hand to integrate hardware and software into a smart, environmentally sustainable solution to improve how commercial facilities use hot water,&#8221; said John Larkin, head of Impact Investments and co-manager of the Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund. &#8220;Intellihot reflects well upon our strategy to partner with great businesses that can deliver financial performance along with beneficial outcomes for society and planet.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Larkin points out, if the hot water stops flowing, things very quickly get unpleasant. The challenge with hot water is that usage is incredibly time-specific. If the building has apartments or gyms in it, 7 am is a huge peak, and if the hot water runs out, the building managers&#8217; phones won&#8217;t stop ringing. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also painfully expensive to heat water and to keep it hot, especially at times where hot water usage is lower than usual. Intellihot is addressing all of the above, using tankless, on-demand water heating solutions for a wide range of commercial buildings, including hotels, restaurants, stadiums, hospitals and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, truly we started it as outsiders, with no connection to the industry. I am passionate about energy loss; every time I see the radiator or a tailpipe on a car, I know that its singular purpose is to heat the environment,&#8221; explains Sridhar Deivasigamani, founder and CEO of Intellihot. &#8220;I felt the same thing when a water heater broke at my house. And since then, we have totally reinvented how water is heated and delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lot of applications, having a large tank of water means that hot water is instantly available while more water is being heated up. That&#8217;s convenient and serves as a buffer, but it is also spectacularly expensive to keep a large tank of water at temperature. In residential homes, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/water-heaters/tankless-water-heaters-vs-storage-tank-water-heaters-a5291982593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports is seeing an increase</a> in the popularity of tankless, on-demand water heaters, but for commercial buildings, the adaptation has significantly lagged behind. One of the biggest challenges in this space is that a lot of planning and engineering goes into building and upgrading medium to large commercial buildings. When the buildings are designed, the space allocated to hot water is typically designed for water tanks &#8212; which have an 80% larger footprint than Intellihot&#8217;s heaters. Once the space is there, and the energy cost of heating the water is calculated into the overall energy expenditure of the building, there hasn&#8217;t traditionally been much incentive to switch to a tankless solution &#8212; but that is very slowly starting to shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the first new startup in this space in almost 100 years,&#8221; claims Deivasigamani. &#8220;If you look at the big three companies in this space, they all started in the late 1800s. So you have generations and generations of builders, building engineers and contractors thinking this is the only way it can be done.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the incumbents are also starting to produce tankless heaters, but Intellihot believes it has an edge in the approach it takes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equipment always breaks down on a Friday night, and 90% of equipment is replaced when there is an emergency. That&#8217;s not ideal. If you&#8217;re a Chipotle or Starbucks, the solution today is to double up the number of equipment they have. That&#8217;s not great for the environment. We have an alternate approach: we launched a piece of equipment that is called <a href="https://intellihot.com/products-commercial-tankless-hot-water-heater-type-gas/tellibot-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tellibot AI</a>,&#8221; explains Deivasigamani. The equipment connects to water heaters to gather data based on flow, heating patterns, etc. You install it for 10 days, and the company will analyze the data and give you a projection for how long the existing equipment will continue to perform. The goal is to give building owners a chance to replace water heaters as scheduled maintenance, rather than at the worst possible time, at exorbitant 24-hour-call-out rates.</p>
<p>Intellihot has its equipment installed &#8220;in thousands of buildings,&#8221; its CEO told me, including hotels, multi-family residential buildings, senior living facilities, hospitals and more. The company claims it has logged more than 670 million hours of operation without failures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America as the e-commerce market explodes in the region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new company is entering the crowded e-commerce aggregator space to acquire and scale high-performing Latin American brands selling on MercadoLibre, Shopify or Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://quinio.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinio</a>, a Mexico-based company, announced today it secured $20 million in a debt-and-equity round that will be used to add more than 30 brands to its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company was founded last year by Juan Gavito, Iker Garay and Gavito’s brother, Santiago Gavito. CEO Juan Gavito, who was previously in digital advertising, and Garay have backgrounds in private equity and venture capital, while Santiago Gavito was scaling startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Iker introduced us to Thrasio’s business model and we got excited,” Juan Gavito told TechCrunch. “We thought this is the way to capture value, so we started working on everything from creating the pipeline, team, tools and understanding the specifics of doing the acquisition.”</p>
<p>Quinio isn’t focused on any certain categories, but is going after medium-sized brands that bring in between $100,000 and $20 million in annual revenue. After acquisition, the Quinio team focuses on increasing sales, operations efficiency and optimizing cost structures.</p>
<p>The company will kick off the new year with 10 brands representing $10 million revenue run rate. That has enabled Quinio to realize double-digit growth each month so far. And although the company is initially looking at acquiring 30 brands, Gavito estimates there are 100,000 sellers across Latin America that fit its strategy among a market worth $105 billion.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Cometa, which was joined by AlleyCorp, DILA Capital, Western Technology Investment, GBM Ventures, Bridge Partners and a group of entrepreneurs, including Adalberto Flores, founder and CEO of Kueski.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito expects to use over 80% of the new capital on acquiring companies, with a plan of one per month. The company will also expand its staff — at 33 people today — to over 100 by the end of next year as it begins looking for brands outside of Mexico in Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the new funding, Quinio joins a long list of aggregators, also known as e-commerce roll-ups, around the world that have also attracted investor attention to purchase marketplace companies.</p>
<p>For example, Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a> this week. Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito says the e-commerce aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America, with a few initial players launching operations between January and August of this year, all in Mexico.</p>
<p>He notes this is due to the region being one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world, citing a gross merchandise value growth of over 60% in 2020, to $105 billion, which represents double the growth rate initially expected before the global pandemic hit. E-commerce is expected to grow another 30% this year, Juan Gavito said.</p>
<p>One of the ways Quinio is differentiating itself is by acquiring companies with locally sourced products, with plans to have more than 60% of its portfolio this way.</p>
<p>“This is a key differential in terms of lead times and working capital requirements, especially considering the problems that the current Asia supply chain is facing,” Juan Gavito said. “There are just a few players in such a large market, so there is opportunity for all of us to have successful companies and business models. For example, in the U.S., there are more than 20, and many are successful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce roll-up play <a href="https://www.opontia.com/">Opontia</a> launched in June, raising $20 million in debt and equity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> older, small e-commerce brands in the Middle East and Africa. Today, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has closed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, a $42 million Series A nine months after it was founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll-up plays are generally known to secure more debt than equity when they raise mega-round deals. Opontia&#8217;s seed round was the case, but the share between equity and venture debt stands at about 50% each for its Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STV led the round, with Raed Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Upper90 and VentureSouq participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angel investors Salman Butt of Salla and Wiktor Namysl of McKinsey Poland joined, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture debt fund Partners for Growth funded Opontia&#8217;s debt financing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch gathered that Opontia has somewhat switched focus on its target market. Though it launched with eyes on the Middle East and Africa, the company has only made efforts in some parts of the former (the UAE and Saudi Arabia) while making significant headway into Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Turkey and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is opportunity there; it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not the biggest markets,&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnstonphilip/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Johnston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said when asked why Opontia wasn&#8217;t in Africa yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Poland is six times the size of Egypt, for example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e-commerce spend. We&#8217;re definitely going to Africa; we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are doing the biggest markets first. So if you have to prioritize, you go for the market that&#8217;s the biggest and then you work your way down. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the biggest markets for us, it&#8217;s Poland, Turkey, Saudi, UAE, Nigeria, after that is Egypt and Pakistan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has a slight operational and geographical difference, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Opontia founders, while Thrasio, Berlin Brands, Branded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Western Europe, Opontia has found an opening in targeting brands in East and Central Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, none of these players except Opontia is active in the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike the more prominent players, Opontia pursues an omnichannel model instead of a singular model targeting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;FBA&#8221; &#8212; fullfillment by Amazon &#8212; businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when one of our unique values is we are building like a house of brands on our omnichannel setup. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So compared to Thrasio, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on FBA, we focus on three different sales channels &#8212; marketplaces, website, Shopify and social commerce,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manfredmeyer82/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manfred Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So our acquisitions are now like 50% marketplace, but 50% marketplace and Shopify. What we&#8217;re doing is like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like building a setup where you can serve all the customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not only on the Amazon marketplace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/opontia-raises-20m-to-roll-up-e-commerce-brands-in-africa-and-the-middle-east/">spoke to TechCrunch</a> in June, they mentioned that Opontia was in talks with &#8220;more than 100 small e-commerce brands&#8221; and claimed to have signed several term sheets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, it has purchased four brands, including Novimed, a UAE-based direct-to-consumer outfit that sells medical equipment and therapeutic products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And since acquiring Novimed in August, Opontia said it has quadrupled the brand&#8217;s revenues and doubled its profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Opontia exists because we realized that there are many e-commerce entrepreneurs in CEEMEA who have grown their brands to a certain point but now need help to take it to the next level,&#8221; the founders said in an email response on why brands see getting acquired by Opontia as a viable option</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We give the founder an attractive exit, while also giving them a share in the future growth in the profit of the brand as we scale them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 20 more brands across Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East in six months. J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ohnston said at least two-thirds of the Series A investment, about $30 million, will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to carry out these acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has also hired a former executive at Jumia Kenya as its VP of operations, who will be responsible for the company&#8217;s efforts in Africa as it hopes to establish offices in Egypt and Nigeria, in addition to those in Istanbul, Warsaw, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://minlyapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a MENA-based media and entertainment startup, announced today that it has acquired <a href="https://www.oulo.com/">Oulo</a>, a Dubai-based celebrity shoutout platform, for an undisclosed fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition is coming six months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a $3.6 million seed round and off the back of an impressive year of growth that saw the platform &#8212; which connects fans with athletes, musicians and stars through personalized experiences &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 130,000 users and 1,000 celebrities in over a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oulo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a video gifting platform with more than 300 celebrities across Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 by Kamal Nazha.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merged business will operate under the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brand and roll out its combined experience offerings across the GCC region. And as part of the transaction, Nazha will join </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the chief commercial officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 450 million people in the MENA region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One out of three are between the ages of 18 to 30 &#8212; a group with a deep connection to social media and fast contributing more to the global creator economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is optimizing its solution to capture a budding audience in the MENA region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shinnawy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed El-Shinnawy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spoke to TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/27/egypts-minly-raises-3-6m-to-connect-celebrities-and-fans-through-personalized-experiences/">in June</a>, he mentioned that the company was doubling down on building local celebrity acquisition teams across MENA and the GCC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One wouldn&#8217;t have interpreted his statement as an expansion rather than a literal acquisition play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whilst Minly&#8217;s expansion in the GCC market was possible without Oulo, this acquisition has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerated our expansion there,&#8221; El-Shinnawy said when asked why the company acquired Oulu instead of expanding on its own. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to become the number one creator economy platform in the region, and speed to market is critical to achieving this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stated that the acquisition adds critical assets to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; Oulo&#8217;s roster of tier-1 pan-Arab Levantian stars, its strategic partnerships and team who can support Minly&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> existing team, both in the Levant and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the majority of pan-Arab celebrities were either Egyptian or Lebanese. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, combining forces unlocks immense synergies as, together, we dominate the two most important sources of cultural content,&#8221; said Nazha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that following the acquisition, the company&#8217;s primary objectives are to launch new complementary products, deepen its roster of stars and grow its geographic reach via an increased presence in other MENA and Arabic-speaking countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are the clear choice for stars in the region looking to create unforgettable, authentic digital experiences with fans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This acquisition will widen the gap, as the Oulo team shares the same mission and passion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minly-Oulo deal is the second major acquisition between an African and a GCC-based startup this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gradual return of tourism and travel in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to see a wave of startups raising rounds of funding to meet new opportunities in the market. In the latest development, <a href="https://easol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easol</a>, which has built event and experiences software that third-party companies can use to market and sell bookings &#8212; it includes a website builder, reservation and booking tools, and payment plug-ins &#8212; has picked up $25 million, a Series A that it will be using to continue building out its software stack, with a view to being a one-stop shop for experiences organizers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we enable [organizers] to sell events, but we don’t give them distribution,&#8221; said CEO Ben Simpson, who co-founded the London-based startup with his wife Lisa. &#8220;We see that as a major opportunity, giving creators the chance to get inventory from elsewhere and push theirs out to other places.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has seen some strong growth in the last year, after a period in which Simpson said it had zero revenue due to travel and gathering restrictions in 2020. Since closing a seed round of $4.5 million that year, it has grown the number of organizers (which Easol calls &#8220;creators&#8221;) tenfold, with the customer base up 913%, transaction numbers up 50x, and spend on the platform up by 30x. It has set ambitious targets to treble its growth in 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its software is used across some 130 countries, although the majority of the consumers engaging in the events themselves are based out of North America and Europe, Simpson said.</p>
<p>Those are scaling and traction numbers that catch the attention of VCs, and this latest round is has some of the biggies. Tiger Global is leading the Series A, with participation also from previous backers Notion Capital, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator (Easol was in the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/easol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S18 batch</a>) and FMZ Ventures &#8212; which is led by Michael Zeisser, the former Chairman of US investments at Alibaba. (Zeisser is also joining the board.)</p>
<p>Travel and tourism startups definitely shaped up to be some of the biggest pity cases during the pandemic: through no mishandling of their own, some of the most promising founders and companies found themselves suddenly in freefall when their customers &#8212; and depending on the business model, the customers of their customers &#8212; simply stopped moving around and doing things. That vacuum however also led to some very interesting pivots and efforts to find business in completely new places.</p>
<p>Peek, one of Easol&#8217;s competitors in the experiences management space &#8212; went from focusing mainly on its own experiences marketplace and turned to providing more and better tools and wider guidance to their events management customers. It too recently raised a significant round of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million just last month</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Easol might look quite a lot like Peek on the front end, however, the ethos behind what it&#8217;s doing is very different. The Simpsons came to founding the startup having previously been on the event organizing side of the equation, starting and running events like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise</a> &#8211; a massive ski/clubbing/music confab in the French Alps. Ben said that building and running that raised a ton of organizational issues specifically when it came to IT.</p>
<p class="p1">The festival not only sells tickets to events, but it manages lift passes and a range of different accomodation options, as well as a variety of ski experiences and equipment hire. &#8220;We had to run the whole thing through five different platforms,&#8221; he recalled, &#8220;which also meant a number of separate transaction fees. They had all that power on their side.&#8221; So they came up with a plan. &#8220;What if we build and ran all of that, and didn&#8217;t charge ridiculous fees but built it around a subscription model with smaller fees? Then creators could customize the journey end to end, and keep the experience all in one place, and invest in their own growth.&#8221; (Currently, the <a href="https://easol.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing model</a> is based on three tiers depending on the level of service, at £5/month, £54/month or £207/month offering a variety of different features and a commission scale that changes depending on how much you pay per month.)<b></b></p>
<p>All this is sufficiently specialized enough, Lisa added, that they didn&#8217;t feel it really existed in the complex way that experience creators needed it to. She said they thus refer to the category with a distinct term: &#8220;experience commerce.&#8221; They left Rise, which became a customer, with other current users including Wanderlust, Ibiza Rocks, Global Cycle Network, Untravelled Paths and Envision Festival.</p>
<p>The returns are what have made the pitch compelling to these companies: Easol claims that for an event with a $2 million turnover, using Easol&#8217;s software instead of a mix of third-party tools works out to more than $80,000 of savings annually.</p>
<p>“Easol’s market-leading platform and industry expertise allows clients to imagine and market unique experiences for consumers,&#8221; said Evan Feinberg of Tiger Global in a statement. &#8220;In the rapidly expanding experience commerce market, we believe Easol is poised to capture outsized growth, and we are excited to partner with Ben, Lisa and the Easol team.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/d46570d1b23448a6c8d2251e26f99102bc1d47bf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bento.africa%2F&amp;userId=1725294&amp;signature=bc5b84af3f271644">Bento</a>, Nigeria’s digital payroll and human resource management platform is expanding to Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda with plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa over the next one year.</p>
<p>In its next phase of expansion, Bento is eyeing Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola and Ethiopia by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Bento is tapping the payroll and HR management market in Africa that has traditionally relied on laborious analog processes to disburse pay. The startup, founded in 2019, is helping businesses to automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances including taxes and pension.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244703" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Seeing so many companies using analogue methods to manage their workforce is both frustrating and exciting for us. Employers don’t have access to locally customized, world-class payroll and HRM tools, and employees can’t easily access third-party services to help make life easier. When you think about it, your salary powers your life, so we’re building the operating system that will have a profound impact on the African continent for generations to come,” said Bento co-founder and CEO, Ebun Okubanjo.</p>
<p>Bento said that its platform is leveraging data to extend credit solutions to third parties (employees) and other services like unemployment insurance, savings and investments.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s proprietary credit engine, built in partnership with Israel’s Tarya, ensures the disbursement of instant loans.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Bento currently serves over 900 businesses including healthcare and financial service companies such as Hygeia and Tangerine Africa, and Y Combinator-backed startups Paystack, Kobo360, Branch and LORI Systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re starting with payroll and HRM, but moving rapidly towards Salary 2.0, where we redefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent,” said Bento’s other co-founder and COO, Chidozie David Okonkwo.</p>
<p>“Having successfully established product-market fit in Nigeria, one of the most difficult markets to penetrate in Africa, we’re excited to roll out across the continent and solve the real problems we know millions of employers and employees face on a daily basis,” said Okonkwo.</p>
<p>Bento’s expansion comes about a month after Workpay, a Nairobi-based payroll and HR management startup, expanded to Nigeria to tap small medium sized businesses in the West African region. Workpay, a Y Combinator startup, is among the 50 enterprises in Africa that received equity-free funding and support from Google. Workpay said its platform makes it possible for companies to pay in 15 currencies across Africa and to hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity. Its platform currently supports 400 businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cinetpay.com/">CinetPay</a>, a payment gateway that allows e-merchants and merchants to accept mobile money and other forms of payments in Francophone Africa, has secured $2.4 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital fund 4DX Ventures and unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> are the investors in the round, and it signifies two particular markers for the pair. CinetPay is their first investment in the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/idrissmarcialmonthe&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiot9647tP0AhVTiP0HHVYLBzsQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Pq3P2OHcp2ZVjPdDspjZi"> Idriss Monthe</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ci.linkedin.com/in/daniel-dindji-7a1418122&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjurMG-7tP0AhWpgv0HHZRkCwMQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3b8c27f9Pi3ghM6LAnXa-a">Daniel Dindji </a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in 2016 after CEO Monthe experienced issues collecting payments at his previous startup, CinetCore, a site specializing in the sale of online domain names.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we launched our website to sell domain names online, we faced difficulty in collecting online payment after creating many PayPal accounts which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were blocked by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PayPal because we were in Africa,&#8221; the CEO told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the cost that we make is that in Francophone Africa 80% of the population have a mobile money account. And between 10 and 20% of people have a bank account and credit cards. We decided to explore the tract of mobile money and create a payment gateway, where we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all mobile money available in Francophone Africa to enable merchants to accept online payments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ivorian startup acts as an online and point-of-sale payment solution for merchants to process payment from more than 130 different payment operators &#8212; mobile-money, bank cards, wallets &#8212; in nine French-speaking African countries: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Congo, Guinea and Benin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, merchants have to open an account and then upload their KYC, integrate Cinet&#8217;s APIs and start collecting payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each merchant pays an annual subscription fee of $20 a year and Cinet collects 1-1.5% commission on every transaction made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244715" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244715" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244715" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Team-CinetPay.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244715" class="wp-caption-text">CinetPay team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants on the platform range from e-commerce platforms and digital public services to insurance companies and schools. Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 12,000 merchants have registered on the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Monthe admits that only 400 of them are active. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked why the company had a poor retention rate, he said most active merchants have opened several accounts in the past before sticking with one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also possible that CinetPay&#8217;s numbers are a reflection of the presence of bigger payments gateways such as MFS Africa and PawaPay that target sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s 562 million registered mobile money accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the company has done fine in its own right. So far, it has processed more than 30 million transactions for these 400 active merchants, processing about $12.5 million in transactions monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been tracking the Francophone Africa market for some time now, and have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CinetPay’s ambitious goal to digitize payments across the region,” said Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures. “We look forward to partnering with the CinetPay team alongside our long-time portfolio company, Flutterwave, to help usher in the next phase of digital payments across the Francophone region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave&#8217;s involvement in the round is a continuation of the unicorn&#8217;s partnership with CinetPay that started in 2019, said both companies in a statement. It is also a diversification from the mobile money moves Flutterwave has made recently where it signed a partnership with MTN to allow businesses in select countries to receive MTN mobile money (MoMo) via the gateway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola said the investment in CinetPay is an example of the duo&#8217;s shared vision to &#8220;simplify payments on the continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CinetPay said the seed investment gives it the opportunity to boost its sales and marketing efforts across the markets in West and Central Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monthe maintained that despite the company&#8217;s size being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smaller to that of its competitors, its geographical presence, technology and mission to &#8220;simplify payment and make it accessible via all channels&#8221; makes it different from other players. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plan is to be the foremost payment gateway in the next four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our vision is to be the first payment aggregator in Francophone Africa by 2025. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our geographical presence in 15 countries in Francophone Africa. First </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovation, first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market share,&#8221; he remarked in a grandiose manner.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s has acquired the Austria-headquartered startup GeoGebra, the latest in a series of purchases by the Indian edtech giant this year as it scales its online learning platform across the globe.</p>
<p>Neither of the firms disclosed the purchase price, but a source familiar with the matter said the deal size is about $100 million and includes both cash and stock. Byju’s declined to comment.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/?lang=en">GeoGebra</a> operates an interactive and collaborative mathematics learning tool and reaches over 100 million students across more than 195 countries and territories. The platform offers its service to both enterprises as well as philanthropic non-profit organisation, the latter of which accesses GeoGebra at no charge. Byju&#8217;s said GeoGebra&#8217;s current apps and web services will continue to be available for free post the acquisition.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244707" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;GeoGebra was born out of a passion to help students learn math in a visually appealing and engaging manner. Our shared passion for learning and teaching resonates with BYJU’S, making them a perfect partner for our onward journey. I am confident that this partnership will help millions of students learn mathematics in an interactive way, in turn making them overcome their fear of math and learn to master it,&#8221; said Markus Hohenwarter, co-founder of GeoGebra, in a statement.</p>
<p>Byju’s said the GeoGebra acquisition “complements” its product strategy. The most valuable Indian startup will integrate GeoGebra’s offerings with its products to make “math more engaging” for its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GeoGebra team has built a powerful and stimulating platform that complements BYJU’S mission of providing impactful learning for students. Designed to improve mathematical understanding, it offers significant features that provide interactive resources that adapt to every child’s style and pace of learning,” said Anita Kishore, Chief Strategy Officer of Byju’s, in a statement.</p>
<p>“At Byju&#8217;s, with the help of innovative teaching and technology, we have been making Math fun, visual, and engaging. And with GeoGebra on board, we will continue to further enhance, reimagine and transform the way Math is taught and learned. Together with our combined strengths, we will have a wider reach and the best resources to build innovative and exciting next-generation learning formats,” she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GeoGebra is the latest in a series of about 10 purchases Byju&#8217;s has made this year as it looks to fill the whitespaces in its offerings. The Bangalore-headquartered startup has this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/">acquired Tynker</a>, Scholr, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash Institute</a>, Hashlearn, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">Epic</a>, Great Learning, and Gradeup among others for over $2 billion in cash and equity deals.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran, founder and chief executive of Byju’s, told TechCrunch in an earlier interview that the firm is still looking for more merger and acquisition opportunities. In the meantime, Byju&#8217;s is also exploring an initial public offering as soon as next year. TechCrunch first reported that some bankers including Morgan Stanley have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">pitched a $50 billion valuation to Byju&#8217;s</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, at the start of the fintech services boom in Africa, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oblantern/?originalSubdomain=uk">Oliver Blantern</a> got an opportunity to work in the continent offering advisory services to high-growth startups. For slightly over three years his company, Riverhouse Technology, helped the emerging tech firms in talent sourcing and acquisition.</p>
<p>The trained lawyer did all this while running the Africa Payments Club, a platform that brought together a pool of founders, experts and investors in the tech space to connect and address common business challenges as well as to scout for opportunities in Africa.</p>
<p>The platform, born out of his experiences at Riverhouse, provided a light-bulb moment to Blantern, who in March this year launched <a href="https://impactrooms.com/">Impact Rooms</a> to provide solutions to some of the obstacles that founders, investors and executives regularly face.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Impact Rooms offers well-rounded solutions for startup problems, from ensuring that they are investor-ready and are matched with the right investors, to raising capital. To be investor-ready means that the startups have strong financial models, are sourcing the right kind of human capital, and comply with regulations.</p>
<p>Blantern said the Impact Rooms is also using data to help investors make decisions on which countries, industries or startups to invest in – giving an equal opportunity to startups across all markets in Africa.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage a high percentage of capital into regions outside the four main markets (South Africa, Kenya, Egypt and Nigeria) as much as we can. We want to encourage capital into African women-led businesses, and to support a high number of existing local and global investors to invest more capital in this market,” Impact Room CEO and founder Blantern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On Impact Rooms, startups also get access to a diverse range of services, including legal and marketing support, from the platform’s other partners. Impact Rooms is backed by US-based investment group Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/world-mobile-group-bringing-zanzibaris-online-through-mobile-network-built-on-blockchain/">Blockchain</a> Ventures (GBV).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our job is to support startups and help them all the way to maturity. We conduct company evaluations through investor-readiness support and offer introductions to relevant service partners, and then support with capital raising.”</p>
<p>The Impact Rooms team is currently spread across the world with some of its experts in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">Kenya</a>, Zambia, Ghana, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Australia, US, UK and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Blantern said that the startup has also built a database to provide insights on how investors are making investment decisions.</p>
<p>“It is the most comprehensive and intelligent investor database for Africa, and it allows us to understand why some companies raise capital and others don’t, as well as to improve their chances in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms uses its proprietary algorithm, Cortex, to conduct company evaluations and in valuation benchmarking to understand trends.</p>
<p>The startup is planning to establish Smart Fund, an investor-matching program that uses algorithms to pick the best opportunities for funders. The fund will bring together investors with shared interests from across the world to expand their investment prospects in Africa.</p>
<p>“We work and partner with investors, incubators, companies, and all kinds of ecosystem players, including financial service providers &#8211;we are not a competitor. We are here to work with everyone in this ecosystem,” he said.</p>
<p>Impact Rooms is currently working with 14 startups from six countries across Africa, spanning different specialties from e-commerce to blockchain-based communications. The supported startups include Ghana’s Wala Digital Health, a SaaS Software connecting hospitals and donors for critical blood transfusions.</p>
<p>The startup has so far evaluated 85 companies and by the end of next year, it hopes to work with 5,000 companies across the continent and to directly, or indirectly create an additional 10,000 jobs. This in addition to helping 1,000 startups raise funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jin Stedge studied aerospace engineering at MIT, but after she found herself at Scotty Labs, an SRI International spin-out focused on autonomous driving, she says she came to appreciate how far away the tech is from large-scale adoption.</p>
<p>Indeed, when Scotty was acquired by DoorDash in the summer of 2019, she teamed up with Sanjaya Wijeratnebut, a colleague and senior software engineer at Scotty Labs, and they got to work on a more ruthlessly practical challenge: empowering truck drivers to run their current businesses more efficiently.</p>
<p>For Stedge, it was largely personal. Her  grandparents were owner operators who acquired up to six trucks in the 1980s; her uncles and cousins later entered the business, too, she says. Armed with their insights, she knew the daily difficulties that independent truckers endure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244679" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She also knew that predictions by AI experts who said truck drivers would be out of work <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-experts-predict-the-future-truck-drivers-out-of-jobs-by-2027-surgeons-by-2053/">by 2027</a> were flat wrong. &#8220;If you think about what long-haul truckers do,&#8221; says Stedge, &#8220;they go over the Rockies, they have to tarp freight to the back of their trucks, they&#8217;re often without cell service for hours at a time &#8212; that kind of environment is just really hard to automate.&#8221;</p>
<p>It helped, of course, that the market they&#8217;d be chasing is enormous. It&#8217;s no coincidence that so many startups have flocked to address different aspects of the trucking industry, from brokers and load marketplaces to outfits that help with cash flow, make equipment, provide insurance or make compliance products.</p>
<p>In fact, the opportunity that Stedge and Wijeratnebut spied with their startup, <a href="https://www.truenorthfleet.com/">TrueNorth</a>, was to create a single, easy-to-use platform to help truckers manage their customers; find, book, and coordinate loads; optimize their routes; invoice their customers; and collect payment. It would also pay them upon the completion of a job, so drivers wouldn&#8217;t be forced to wait a month or more to be paid, as has long been customary.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/">SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;SoftBank-backed Flock Freight is the freight industry&#8217;s newest unicorn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/softbank-backed-flock-freight-is-the-freight-industrys-newest-unicorn/embed/#?secret=bfCQsWOw9s" data-secret="bfCQsWOw9s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea, broadly speaking, was for TrueNorth to give the independent truckers who make up somewhere between 10% and 20% of the industry the resources of a larger fleet &#8212; and better economics.</p>
<p>Y Combinator liked the pitch enough to welcome Stedge and Wijeratnebut into its winter 2020 batch. A seed check from Sam Altman quickly followed, then an $8.5 million Series A round led by former Stripe exec Lachy Groom.</p>
<p>Now, Stedge says, the company has just closed on $50 million in Series B funding co-led Groom and Altman (along with brothers Max and Jack). Many others have joined the ride, too, including  Flexport Fund, Tribe Capital, Original Capital, K5 Global, 137 Ventures, and Fifth Down Capital.</p>
<p>TrueNorth has so far raised $61.8 million altogether.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2244694 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg" alt="" width="5998" height="3999" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg 5998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3DttJ6vc.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5998px) 100vw, 5998px" /></p>
<p>The question begged is whether TrueNorth, which already employs 50 people &#8212; half of them women, notably &#8212;  can deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>Certainly, the $50 million should help, along with $10 million in working capital that TrueNorth has separately secured from a debt provider. It&#8217;s already using that money to ensure its customers get paid promptly after each job.</p>
<p>The company is also already lowering costs for the roughly 200 truckers already using its software, insists Stedge. She says that just one way it&#8217;s doing this is pooling its customers together and securing lower-cost insurance for the group. (&#8220;An independent trucker who&#8217;s truly on their own will pay $20,000 to $30,000 a year in insurance, which is crazy,&#8221; says Stedge. &#8220;With us, they pay $10,000 a year.&#8221;)</p>
<p>TrueNorth says, too, that it increases drivers&#8217; revenue by helping them find the highest-paying trucking jobs and making it simple to book them.</p>
<p>Still, one outstanding question is how effectively TrueNorth is able to reach its customers, given that it is targeting a very fragmented market. Stedge notes that the company has &#8220;never done outbound sales&#8221; because all of its customers have found the company on their own, and she says that 90% have additionally referred friends. With deeper pocketed rivals, it could need to spin up a more aggressive marketing strategy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One rival in particular would seem to be a threat, and that&#8217;s CloudTrucks, which just two weeks ago closed on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">$115 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in Series B funding and whose founder, Tobenna Arodiogbu, previously cofounded Scotty Labs, where he was CEO.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/">CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/cloudtrucks-raised-115m-series-b-to-help-truck-entrepreneurs-manage-their-business/embed/#?secret=qRO7qlnXOF" data-secret="qRO7qlnXOF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like TrueNorth, Arodiogbu&#8217;s vision is to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their businesses. As he told TechCrunch in late November, &#8220;Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who’s actually doing the really hard work.”</p>
<p>For her part, Stedge sees CloudTruck&#8217;s momentum as a strong signal to truckers and investors alike. &#8220;We serve the same customer, which is independent truckers, [but] I think it&#8217;s good, to be honest,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a humongous market. It&#8217;s a $100 billion market, just in these independent truckers and small fleets. So the more people who are helping owner operations and who are doing that marketing and brand awareness, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Stedge is hiring fast, and revenue is starting to add up for the young company, which charges customers between 15% and 18% of all goods they move. (If that seems high, Stedge observes that big fleets often take closer to 40%.) Right now, those drivers are delivering between $30,000 and $50,000 per year per trucker, which puts TrueNorth&#8217;s gross revenue at between $6 million and $10 million. But that&#8217;s up 3.4 times over the last six months alone, and the company is still mostly operating in its first market Dallas, and more newly in Atlanta, says Stedge.</p>
<p>As important, she says: the company has been significantly improving its contribution margin, which is basically the portion of sales that helps to offset its fixed costs. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re growing really fast if there&#8217;s a leaky bucket,&#8221; says Stedge, who could just as well be talking about one of her trucking customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know that you&#8217;re building a business that lasts, and we have been very efficient with our money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few weeks after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/21/lydia-adds-stock-and-crypto-trading-to-its-payment-app/">stock and crypto trading</a>, French fintech startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is announcing that it has raised a $100 million Series C round. With this funding round, the startup has reached a unicorn valuation, which means that it is currently valued at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Dragoneer and Echo Street are investing in the startup for the first time, and many of Lydia’s existing investors are putting more money on the table, such as Tencent, Accel and Founders Future.</p>
<p>“What’s really impressive with this round is that it is primarily financed by existing investors,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243430" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Times are changing. A few years ago, when a startup chose to raise from its existing investors, it usually meant that the team couldn’t find new investors. So existing investors would accept to put more money in the company in exchange for a lower valuation.</p>
<p>But now, many VC firms have raised huge funds. Hedge funds are now investing in venture rounds. Investing in the most competitive startups have become harder. If a portfolio company is doing well, VC firms now usually want to double down on their previous investment.</p>
<p>And Chiche confirmed that Lydia’s valuation has increased starkly compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/lydia-raises-another-86-million-to-build-european-financial-super-app/">last year’s round</a>.</p>
<p>At first, Lydia was a peer-to-peer payment app. After adding your debit card and your bank details, you could send and receive mobile payments with other Lydia users. It progressively became the dominant mobile payment app in France.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the app has evolved quite a lot to become a financial super app with a wide range of features and financial products. Users can get a virtual or physical debit card that works on the Visa network. They can also manage their money more easily by creating sub-accounts that they can share with other Lydia users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243434" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243434" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="size-full wp-image-2243434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lydia-Trading-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243434" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lydia</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to daily payments, Lydia also offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">small loans</a> from €100 to €3,000, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/" title="Lydia partners with Cashbee to add savings accounts">savings accounts</a>, and now trading. In particular, the new crypto and stock trading partnership with Bitpanda makes it much easier to invest small amounts of money whenever you want.</p>
<p>Lydia and Bitpanda are offering fractional shares so that you can buy, for example, €10 worth of Apple share 24/7 — it’s something quite new for the French market. And given the success of trading in Robinhood and Cash App in the U.S., the new trading feature could represent a big opportunity for the future of the French startup.</p>
<p>By adding more products on top of peer-to-peer payments, Lydia wants to drive engagement. The business model is quite clear. When you’re sending and receiving a handful of payments with the app, everything is free. If you want to go further, the company offers premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>Lydia has attracted 5.5 million users so far. Even more important, a third of French people who are 18 to 35 years old have a Lydia account. In other words, things are going well in France. And the startup now wants to go down the same road in other European countries.</p>
<p>Lydia plans to hire 800 people over the coming three years, including 160 people in 2022 alone. By 2025, the company hopes that 10 million customers in Europe will use Lydia as their primary account.</p>
<p>“What we’re experiencing is the reinvention of the banking industry,” Cyril Chiche told me. According to him, people are not going to manage money the same way in a few years. Some companies will get it while others won’t change.</p>
<p>He doesn’t think it’s a duel between neobanks and incumbents. Some legacy players may have what it takes to stay relevant in the future. But, of course, he truly belies that Lydia can simplify retail banking so that it becomes more accessible to more users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://flip.id/">Flip</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an Indonesia-based fintech startup, announced today it has raised $48 million in a Series B to accelerate its growth. The funding brings Flip’s total capital raised to $65million. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sequoia Capital India, Insight Partners and Insignia Ventures Partners co-led the Series B round. Flip is Insight Partners’ first investment in Indonesia. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup plans to use the fresh capital to accelerate its business expansion further, strengthen its operations in Indonesia, advance technology and expand its engineering and product teams. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243939" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This new funding is a testament to our team’s commitment and persistence. It gives us the resources we need to fuel and accelerate our mission to build innovative solutions that simplify money movement in Indonesia,” said </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arriyan/">Rafi Putra Arriyan</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder and CEO of Flip. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Arriyan, Luqman Sungkar and Ginanjar Ibnu Solikhin co-founded the company in 2015 while studying at University of Indonesia. They built the Flip platform to find an answer to the problem Arriyan himself experienced as a college student – having to wait for a long time to transfer funds and pay a transfer fee each time to different banks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Indonesia, transferring money can be tedious for bank account holders – from funds getting stuck while transferring to lengthy clerical processes and poor product experiences with outdated interfaces and complicated flow. Flip hopes to change that by helping individuals and businesses to eliminate complexity and execute their money transfer at a low cost. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip, which intends to be the most customer-centric financial technology company in the world, enables users to do fair financial transactions from anywhere to anyone. The startup obtained a license from Bank Indonesia (BI) in 2016 to provide financial services, including interbank transfers to more than 100 domestic banks, international remittances, e-wallet top-ups, salary transfers and business solution products.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said the annual volume of money transfer in Indonesia was recorded at a nominal value of more than </span>$2.2 trillion<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in 2020, citing </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/ekonomi-keuangan/spip/Default.aspx">Bank Indonesia&#8217;s data</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Interbank transfer is the most dominant payment method in Indonesia’s fast-growing digital economy. Flip has a massive user base and is growing rapidly with outstanding retention metrics, all of which point to the delightful and seamless product that the company has built… Sequoia Capital India believes that Flip is the most exciting consumer fintech company in Indonesia. The firm is thrilled to be leading the third consecutive round, testament of its high conviction in the company,” said Aakash Kapoor, vice president of Sequoia India. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip serves more than seven million users for various kinds of financial transactions from and to different regions in Indonesia and overseas money transfers. More than 340 Indonesian companies and SMEs in travel, hospitality, e-commerce, transportation, education, outsourcing, crowdfunding, business management sectors use Flip’s employee payroll, customer refunds, invoice/ supplier payments, and international transfers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its users have increased 10x compared to before the pandemic following the increase of technology adoption and mobility restrictions in Indonesia, Arriyan said. During the pandemic, the protocol around mobility restriction in Indonesia resulted in most bank offices closing, requiring people to use technology-based solutions for their financial transactions, he continued. The shift in consumer behavior from visiting bank branches to using digital products increased users, Arriyan added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Flip is disrupting the existing interbank transfer market and has established itself as a clear leader in the category, with its superior product that allows for seamless payment movement between bank partners,” said Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As the first institutional investor in Flip, we have witnessed the incredible growth of the product and the execution of the team over the past two years. Flip is now the dominant player in its space, with millions of Indonesians trusting the platform for their day-to-day financial needs,” said Samir Chaibi, principal at Insignia Ventures Partners.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Flip has added over 250 team members to build its financial services for millions of Indonesian people. The company has increased its team size by 140 % over the past months. </span></p>
