										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://joompay.com/">JoomPay</a>, a startup with a similar product to PayPayl-owned Venmo in the US, is set to launch in Europe shortly after being granted a Luxembourg Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license. The app allows people to send and receive money with anyone, instantly and for free. “<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/venmo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="venmo">Venmo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> me” has become a common phrase in the US, where people use it to split bills in restaurants or similar. Venmo is in common use in the US, but it’s not available in Europe, although dozens of other innovative mobile peer to peer transfer options exist, such as Revolut, N26, Monese and Monzo. The waitlist for the app&#8217;s beta is open now (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/mt/app/joompay-mobile-finance/id1480381529">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joompay.wallet&#038;hl=en&#038;gl=US">Android</a>).</p>
<p>Europe leads the world&#8217;s instant payments industry, with $18 trillion in worldwide volume predicted by 2025 up from $3 trillion in 2020 – a growth of over 500%. Western Europe &#8211; and COVID-19 &#8211; is now driving that innovation and will account for 38% of instant payment transaction value by 2025. While Europe lacks simple peer-to-peer payments solutions such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/venmo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="venmo">Venmo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> or Square Cash App in the US, challenger banks have stepped up to provide similar kinds of services. JoomPay’s opportunity lies in being able to be a middle-man between these various banking systems.</p>
<p>Shopping app <a href="http://Joom.com">Joom</a>, which has been downloaded 150M times in Europe, has spun-off JoomPay to solve this problem. The app allows users to send and receive money from any person, regardless of whether they use JoomPay or not – and you only need to know their email or the phone number. JoomPay connects to any existing debit/credit card or a bank account. It also provides its users with a European IBAN and an optional free JoomPay card with cashback and bonuses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yuri Alekseev, CEO and co-founder of JoomPay, said: &#8220;Since COVID-19 started, we’ve seen a significant decline in cash usage. People can’t meet as easily as before but still need to send money, and we offer a viable alternative.”</p>
<p>JoomPay may have an uphill struggle. Its main competitors in Europe are the huge TransferWise, Paysend, and of course <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/making-tiktok-more-accessible-to-people-with-photosensitive-epilepsy">announced</a> today it is rolling out a new feature that will allow people with photosensitive epilepsy to automatically skip videos that can trigger seizures.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Skip All&#8221; option will be introduced to all users over the next few weeks and comes a few months after TikTok began automatically warning creators if a video contains effects, like flashing lights or certain visual patterns, that can be harmful to people with photosensitive epilepsy. If they upload those videos, TikTok automatically prefaces them with a warning screen.</p>
<p>Once a user turns on the &#8220;Skip All&#8221; option, they won&#8217;t see any videos TikTok has identified as potential triggers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077978" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077978" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2077978 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?w=314" alt="TikTok's warning for videos with content that can trigger epileptic seizures" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Photosensitivity-Warning.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2077978" class="wp-caption-text">TikTok&#8217;s warning for videos with content that can trigger epileptic seizures</p></div></p>
<p>According to the Epilepsy Foundation, one of several organizations TikTok consulted with, the condition affects about 65 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47943607">advocates have called on social media platforms</a>, including YouTube and Facebook, to place warnings before content with potential triggers, the task often falls to individual creators. For example, if a video has flashing lights, they might mention that at the beginning or in its description. But not all creators are aware of photosensitive epilepsy or its triggers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, online trolls have posted harmful content on purpose, sometimes tagging them with keywords related to epilepsy. The Epilepsy Society, another organization that worked with TikTok, <a href="https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/zachslaw">has called for malicious posts</a> to be covered by the United Kingdom’s Online Harms bill.</p>
<p>In a statement published with TikTok’s announcement, Nicola Swanborough, the Epilepsy Society’s acting head of external affairs, said &#8220;social media can be a lifeline for many people with epilepsy, allowing them to connect with others with the condition from around the world,&#8221; and that the organization hopes &#8220;other platforms will follow TikTok’s lead in ensuring greater inclusivity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer drones have over the years struggled with an image of being no more than expensive and delicate toys. But applications in industrial, military and enterprise scenarios have shown that there is indeed a market for unmanned aerial vehicles, and today, a startup that makes drones for some of those latter purposes is announcing a large round of funding and a partnership that provides a picture of how the drone industry will look in years to come.</p>
<p><a href="http://percepto.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Percepto</a>, which makes drones &#8212; both the hardware and software &#8212; to monitor and analyze industrial sites and other physical work areas largely unattended by people, has raised $45 million in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Alongside this, it is now working with Boston Dynamics  and has integrated its Spot robots with Percepto&#8217;s Sparrow drones, with the aim being better infrastructure assessments, and potentially more as Spot&#8217;s agility improves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by a strategic backer, <a href="https://www.kochind.com/companies/koch-disruptive-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koch Disruptive Technologies</a>, the investment arm of industrial giant <a href="https://www.kochind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koch Industries</a> (which has interests in energy, minerals, chemicals and related areas), with participation also from new investors State of Mind Ventures, Atento Capital, Summit Peak Investments, Delek-US. Previous investors U.S. Venture Partners, Spider Capital and Arkin Holdings also participated. (It appears that Boston Dynamics and SoftBank are not part of this investment.)</p>
<p>Israel-based Percepto has now raised $72.5 million since it was founded in 2014, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation, but CEO and founder Dor Abuhasira described as &#8220;a very good round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives us the ability to create a category leader,&#8221; Abuhasira said in an interview. It has customers in around 10 countries, with the list including ENEL, Florida Power and Light and Verizon.</p>
<p>While some drone makers have focused on building hardware, and others are working specifically on the analytics, computer vision and other critical technology that needs to be in place on the software side for drones to work correctly and safely, Percepto has taken what I referred to, and Abuhasira confirmed, as the &#8220;Apple approach&#8221;: vertical integration as far as Percepto can take it on its own.</p>
<p>That has included hiring teams with specializations in AI, computer vision, navigation and analytics as well as those strong in industrial hardware &#8212; all strong areas in the Israel tech landscape, by virtue of it being so closely tied with its military investments. (Note: Percepto does not make its own chips: these are currently acquired from Nvidia, he confirmed to me.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The Apple approach is the only one that works in drones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s because it is all still too complicated. For those offering an Android-style approach, there are cracks in the complete flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It presents the product as a &#8220;drone-in-a-box&#8221;, which means in part that those buying it have little work to do to set it up to work, but also refers to how it works: its drones leave the box to make a flight to collect data, and then return to the box to recharge and transfer more information, alongside the data that is picked up in real time.</p>
<p>The drones themselves operate on an on-demand basis: they fly in part for regular monitoring, to detect changes that could point to issues; and they can also be launched to collect data as a result of engineers requesting information. The product is marketed by Percepto as &#8220;AIM&#8221;, short for autonomous site inspection and monitoring.</p>
<p>News broke last week that Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/amazons-drone-delivery-team-hit-with-layoffs-amid-reorganization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reorganising</a> its Prime Air efforts &#8212; one sign of how some more consumer-facing business applications &#8212; despite many developments &#8212; may still have some turbulence ahead before they are commercially viable. Businesses like Percepto&#8217;s stand in contrast to that, with their focus specifically on flying over, and collecting data, in areas where there are precisely no people present.</p>
<p>It has dovetailed with a bigger focus from industries on the efficiencies (and cost savings) you can get with automation, which in turn has become the centerpiece of how industry is investing in the buzz phrase of the moment, &#8220;digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We believe Percepto AIM addresses a multi-billion-dollar issue for numerous industries and will change the way manufacturing sites are managed in the IoT, Industry 4.0 era,” said Chase Koch, President of Koch Disruptive Technologies, in a statement. “Percepto’s track record in autonomous technology and data analytics is impressive, and we believe it is uniquely positioned to deliver the remote operations center of the future. We look forward to partnering with the Percepto team to make this happen.”</p>
<p>The partnership with Boston Dynamics is notable for a couple of reasons: it speaks to how various robotics hardware will work together in tandem in an automated, unmanned world; and it speaks to how Boston Dynamics is pulling up its socks.</p>
<p>On the latter front, the company has been making waves in the world of robotics for years, specifically with its agile and strong dog-like (with names like &#8220;Spot&#8221; and &#8220;Big Dog&#8221;) robots that can cover rugged terrains and handle tussles without falling apart.</p>
<p>That led it into the arms of Google, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/google-buys-boston-dynamics-creator-of-big-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired it</a> as part of its own secretive moonshot efforts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/google-buys-boston-dynamics-creator-of-big-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2013</a>. That never panned out into a business, and probably gave Google more complicated optics at a time when it was already being seen as too powerful. Then, SoftBank stepped in to pick it up, along with other robotics assets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/08/softbank-is-buying-robotics-firm-boston-dynamics-and-schaft-from-alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2017</a>. That hasn&#8217;t really gone anywhere either, it seems, and just this month it was reported that Boston Dynamics was reportedly facing yet another suitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/hyundai-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-softbank-owned-boston-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyundai</a>.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that partnerships with third parties that are going places (quite literally) become strong signs of how Boston Dynamics&#8217; extensive R&amp;D investments might finally pay off with enterprising dividends.</p>
<p>Indeed, while Percepto has focused on its own vertical integration, longer term and more generally there is an argument to be made for more interoperability and collaboration between the various companies building &#8220;connected&#8221; and smart hardware for industrial, physical applications. It means that specific industries can focus on the special equipment and expertise they require, while at the same time complementing that with hardware and software that are recognised as best-in-class. Abuhasira said that he expects the Boston Dynamics partnership to be the first of many.</p>
<p>That makes this first one an interesting template. It will see Spot carrying Percepto’s payloads for high resolution imaging and thermal vision &#8220;to detect issues including hot spots on machines or electrical conductors, water and steam leaks around plants and equipment with degraded performance, with the data relayed via AIM.&#8221; It will also mean a more thorough picture, beyond what you get from the air, and potentially a point at which the data that the pairing sources results even in repairs or other work to fix issues.</p>
<p>“Combining Percepto’s Sparrow drone with Spot creates a unique solution for remote inspection,” said Michael Perry, VP of Business Development at Boston Dynamics, in a statement. “This partnership demonstrates the value of harnessing robotic collaborations and the insurmountable benefits to worker safety and cost savings that robotics can bring to industries that involve hazardous or remote work.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our &lt;a href=&#8221;https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6”>survey of VCs in Israel will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic. The Israeli VC eco-system is closely aligned with the European one, with many VCs co-investing with VCs in Israel, hence their inclusion in this survey.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Israel&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Israel, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/">$215 million from SoftBank</a> to double down on the surge of interest in online learning, Kahoot has made an acquisition to expand the scope of subjects that it covers. The popular startup, which lets people build and share educational games, has picked up Drops, a startup that helps people learn languages by way of short picture- and word-based games. The plan is to integrate more Kahoot features into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/drops-8841" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="drops-8841">Drops&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> apps, and to bring some of Drops&#8217; content into the main Kahoot platform.</p>
<p>Kahoot, which trades a part of its shares through Norway&#8217;s alternative exchange the Merkur Market and currently has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KAHOOT-ME.OL?p=KAHOOT-ME.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market cap of over $3 billion</a>, said in an <a href="https://kahoot.com/press/2020/11/24/kahoot-acquires-drops-to-make-language-learning-awesome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> that it would pay $31 million in cash, plus up to $19 million more in cash and shares, based on Drops meeting certain targets between now and 2022. The deal is expected to close this month, and is the company&#8217;s biggest to date.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Drops makes three main apps. First in an eponymous freemium app, with free and paid features, that helps adults learn new languages, currently some 42 in all, with a focus on vocabulary, built around five-minute, &#8220;snackable&#8221; sessions. A second app, Scripts, is aimed at learning to read, write and sign, and it covers four alphabets and four character-based writing systems. A third, Droplets, is aimed specifically at language learning for learners aged between eight and 17. Altogether Drops has clocked up 25 million users.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Notably, one reason it might be off TechCrunch&#8217;s (and the startup world&#8217;s) radar is that it was bootstrapped. (It did go through an accelerator, <a href="http://www.gamefounders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameFounders</a>.) But it has had some notable accolades, including getting named app of the year by Google in 2018.</span></p>
<p>The startup was founded in Estonia and has 21 employees with no &#8220;head office&#8221; as such, with the team spread across Estonia, US, UK, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Hungary, Ukraine and Russia. This could be one reason why it&#8217;s kept costs low: in 2019 it reported gross revenues of $7.5 million (€6.3 million), with cash conversion of 40%.</p>
<p>For some more context, Kahoot &#8212; which is also backed by the likes of Microsoft, Disney and Northzone &#8212; says that in the last 12 months, more than 1 billion participating players in over 200 countries attended over 200 million Kahoot! sessions. That figure includes both educational users of its free services, as well as enterprises, which pay to build and use games (for example related to professional development or business compliance) on the platform.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome Drops to the expanding Kahoot! family as we advance towards our vision to become the leading learning platform in the world,” said Eilert Hanoa, the CEO of Kahoot, in a statement. “Drops’ offerings and innovative learning model are a perfect match to Kahoot!’s mission of making learning awesome through a simple, game-based approach. Drops and language learning becomes the latest addition to our growing offering of learning apps for learners of all ages and abilities. We will continue to expand in new areas to make Kahoot! the ultimate learning destination, at home, school or work, and to make learning awesome!”</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a bonanza for educational apps, which are collectively seeing a huge rush of usage in the last year.</p>
<p>For students, educators and parents, they have become a way of connecting and teaching at a time when physical schools are either closed, or drastically curtailed in what they can do, in order to help limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Businesses and other organizations, on the other hand, are leaning on e-learning as a way of keeping connected with staff, engaging them, and training them at a time when many are working from home.</p>
<p>It might seem ironic that at a time when travel has been drastically limited, if not completely halted altogether, for many of us, that language learning has seen an especially big boom.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s about making hay &#8212; that is, using the moment to get yourself ready for a time in the future when you might actually get to use your newly acquired foreign language skills. Or maybe it&#8217;s just another option for distracting or occupying ourselves in a more constructive way. Whatever might be the motivation or cause, the effect is that language learning is on the up.</p>
<p>Most recently, Duolingo &#8212; which incidentally also uses game-based concepts, where you enter a leaderboard for your learning and your daily sessions become winning streaks &#8212; raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/language-learning-app-duolingo-confirms-it-has-raised-35m-on-a-2-4b-valuation/\" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$35 million on a $2.4 billion valuation</a>, a huge jump for the company.</p>
<p>Kahoot cites <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/948857/digital-language-learning-global-market-size-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">figures</a> that predict that digital language learning will be an $8 billion+ market by 2025 as describes Drops as &#8220;one of the fastest-growing language platforms in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The entire Drops team has spent the last five years building a new way to learn language, and we’re just getting started,” said Daniel Farkas, co-founder and CEO, Drops, in a statement. “We’ve introduced millions of users across the globe to our playful, dynamic approach to language learning. Kahoot! is doing the same for all types of learning. We’re excited to work with such a mission-aligned company to introduce the Drops platform to game-loving learners everywhere.”</p>
<p>This is Kahoot&#8217;s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kahoot-/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fourth acquisition</a>, and its biggest to date. As with Drops, previous M&amp;A deals were made to bolt on new areas of expertise to the platform, such <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/educational-gaming-platform-kahoot-acquires-math-app-maker-dragonbox-for-18m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maths learning</a> for students and more tools to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/user-generated-e-learning-site-kahoot-acquires-actimo-for-up-to-33m-to-double-down-on-corporate-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage enterprise users</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://caura.com/">Caura</a>, the U.K. startup that wants to take the hassle out of car ownership, is launching car insurance &#8212; unveiling its insurtech ambitions.</p>
<p>Dubbed &#8220;Caura Protect,&#8221; the new insurance product claims to reduce the cost and time taken to insure a car, building on the app&#8217;s existing car management features.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/caura/">Launched earlier this year</a> by Sai Lakshmi, who previously co-founded medication management service Echo, Caura is a mobile app designed to manage all of the vehicle-related admin that car owners endure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Drivers are on-boarded by entering their vehicle registration number and can manage parking, tolls, MOT, road tax, congestion charges, and now insurance  — a “one-stop shop” app in a similar vein to Echo. The idea is that Caura minimises car ownership admin and helps to mitigate associated penalty fines.</p>
<p>Caura is FCA approved to undergo various insurance activities and enables drivers to compare insurers and manage their policy within the app. The startup also says it has redesigned the signup and verification process to significantly reduce the time needed to find the best insurance policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caura instantly verifies users against official sources like the DVLA, simplifying the experience, and reducing the risk of insurance fraud,&#8221; says the company.</p>
<p>The idea is to offer a much more user-friendly insurance search and buying process than is typical of price comparison websites that ask for a multiple page questionnaire to be filled out before sending you &#8212; the &#8220;prospect&#8221; &#8212; to the insurer to complete your purchase. Instead, Caura claims that users can research options, select a quote, pay, and be covered to drive in around a minute (if you navigate the app really fast, I&#8217;m assuming).</p>
<p>The insurance cover itself is provided by six of the leading U.K. insurers, including Aviva and Markerstudy.  In early 2021, Caura users will be able to pay for insurance in monthly instalments.</p>
<p>Asked why no one seems to have made shopping around for car insurance quite so straightforward, Lakshmi tells TechCrunch: &#8220;Startups in insurtech have been so busy finding niches that they&#8217;ve forgotten to innovate for the mainstream consumer&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chinese Uber for trucks Manbang announced Tuesday that it has raised $1.7 billion in its latest funding round, two years after it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-truck-idUSKBN1HV0ON">hauled in $1.9 billion</a> from investors including SoftBank Group and Alphabet Inc&#8217;s venture capital fund CapitalG.</p>
<p>The news came fresh off a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-uber-for-trucks-raising-1-7-billion-ahead-of-ipo-next-year-11604996654">Wall Street Journal report</a> two weeks ago that Manbang was seeking $1 billion ahead of an initial public offering next year. The company declined to comment on the matter, though its CEO Zhang Hui <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2019-05-28/doc-ihvhiqay1843937.shtml">said</a> in May 2019 that the firm was &#8220;not in a rush&#8221; to go public.</p>
<p>Manbang said it achieved profitability this year. Its valuation was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-truck-hailing-app-on-course-for-10-billion-valuation-1533726603">reportedly</a> on course to reach $10 billion in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which runs an app matching truck drivers and merchants transporting cargo and provides financial services to truckers, was formed from a <a href="http://www.huochebang.cn/about">merger</a> between rivals Yunmanman and Huochebang in 2017. It was a time when China&#8217;s &#8220;sharing economy&#8221; craze began to see consolidation and shakeup.</p>
<p>The latest financing again attracted high-profile backers, including returning investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vision Fund and Sequoia Capital China, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/permira">Permira</a> and Fidelity, a consortium that co-led the round. Other participants were Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent, Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital and more.</p>
<p>The company has other Alibaba ties. Its CEO Zhang, who founded <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yunmanman" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yunmanman">Yunmanman, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> hailed from Alibaba&#8217;s famed B2B department where Manbang chairman Wang Gang also worked before he went on to fund ride-hailing giant Didi&#8217;s angel round.</p>
<p>Manbang claims its platform has over 10 million verified drivers and 5 million cargo owners. The latest funding will allow it to further invest in research and development, upgrade its matching system, and expand its service capacity to functions like door-to-door transportation.</p>
<p>Sequoia is quite bullish about truck-hailing as it made its sixth investment in Manbang. For Permira, a European private equity fund, the Manbang investment marked the China debut of its <a href="https://www.permira.cn/news-views/%E6%96%B0%E9%97%BB/%E7%92%9E%E7%B1%B3%E8%B5%84%E6%9C%AC%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%83%E5%8F%B7%E5%9F%BA%E9%87%91%E5%8B%9F%E9%9B%86110%E4%BA%BF%E6%AC%A7%E5%85%83/">Growth Opportunities Fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger bank <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> is adding a third subscription product called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/n26" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="n26">N26 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Smart. N26 Smart is designed to be a mid-tier subscription plan with advanced banking features but without a travel insurance package.</p>
<p>In Europe, in addition to the free plan, N26 already provides two subscription tiers called N26 You and N26 Metal. N26 You costs €9.90 per month and comes with higher limits, such as five free ATM withdrawals instead of three and free withdrawals in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>With an N26 You account, you can create sub-accounts (N26 Spaces), share them with other N26 users or use them to save money. As an N26 You subscriber, you also get a travel insurance package with medical travel insurance, trip and flight insurance and more. You can also access some partner offers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>N26 Metal is the most expensive plan and costs €16.90 per month. In addition to everything in N26 You, you get car rental insurance when you’re abroad and phone insurance. As the name suggests, you also get a metal card.</p>
<p>The new N26 Smart subscription costs €4.90 and works well for people who don’t need travel insurance. With an N26 Smart subscription, you can create up to ten sub-accounts. You get five free ATM withdrawals per month. You can also call N26 support directly in addition to in-app support chat.</p>
<p>N26 is launching a new round-up feature for N26 Smart users. It lets you round each purchase up to the nearest Europe and save it in a separate sub-account. N26 Smart account also access colorful debit cards —&nbsp;the same colors as N26 You.</p>
<p>This is just a first step as N26 plans to revamp its subscription products altogether. In the near future, N26 You will become N26 International. There will be more features focused on borderless banking. N26 Metal will become N26 Unlimited.</p>
<p>As for the free N26 Standard account, the company wants to focus on digital cards. Some users are going to switch to the N26 Smart plan to keep some of the features that they’ve been using with a free account. That move should help the company’s bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finally. It only took almost three weeks, but the Biden-Harris transition has officially begun.</p>
<p>On Monday, the General Services Administration gave the green light for the Biden-Harris team to transition from political campaign to government administration, allowing the team to receive government resources like office space, but also classified briefings and secure computers. And, with it, comes a shiny new <code>.gov</code> domain.</p>
<p>Transitioning is an obscure part of the law that&#8217;s rarely discussed, in large part because outgoing governments and incoming administrations largely get on and try to maintain continuity of government through a peaceful transition of power. The process is formally triggered by the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Services Administration, the lesser-known federal agency tasked with the basic functioning of government, and allows the incoming administration to receive funds, tools, and resources to prepare for entering government.</span></p>
<p>But this time around, the agency&#8217;s head Emily Murphy had <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">been reluctant to trigger the formal transition period after the Trump campaign filed a number of lawsuits challenging the election.</span></p>
<p>Murphy finally approved the transition on Monday after Michigan certified its election results.</p>
<p>Up until now, the Biden-Harris team <code>buildbackbetter.com </code>to host its transition website. Now it&#8217;s hosted at <code>buildbackbetter.gov</code>, a departure from the <code>ptt.gov</code> domain used by the incoming Obama-Biden administration in 2008.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-team-lacks-full-u-s-cybersecurity-support-in-transition-fracas-11605891470">Wall Street Journal reported last week</a> that until now the Biden-Harris team was using a Google Workspace for email and collaboration, secured with hardware security keys that staff need to log into their accounts. That setup might suffice for an enterprise, but had security experts worried that the lack of government cybersecurity support could make the camp more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>As for the domain, which you might not think much about, the shift to a <code>.gov</code> domain marks a significant step forwards in the camp&#8217;s cybersecurity efforts. Government domains, hosted on the <code>.gov</code> domain, are <a href="https://digital.gov/2018/10/29/gsa-steps-up-security-for-dotgov/">toughened</a> to prevent against domain hijacking or spoofing. In simple terms, they&#8217;re far more resilient than your regular web hosting services.</p>
<p>Biden tweeted out the domain marking the change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.amprobotics.com/">AMP Robotics</a>, the recycling robotics technology developer backed by investors including <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com/newsroom/2019/11/21/amp-robotics-raises-16-million-series-a-led-by-sequoia-capital-joining-alphabet-backed-sidewalk-infrastructure-partners-and-leaders-in-sustainable-investing">Sequoia Capital and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, is close to closing on as much as $70 million in new financing, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The new financing speaks to AMP Robotics&#8217; continued success in pilot projects and with new partnerships that are exponentially expanding the company&#8217;s deployments.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the company announced a new deal that represented<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/"> its largest purchase order</a> for its trash sorting and recycling robots.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DYLZz5VhRG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/">Sequoia-backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sequoia-backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/embed/#?secret=DYLZz5VhRG" data-secret="DYLZz5VhRG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That order, for 24 machine learning-enabled robotic recycling systems with the waste handling company Waste Connections, was a showcase for the efficacy of the company&#8217;s recycling technology.</p>
<p>That comes on the back of a pilot program earlier in the year with one Toronto apartment complex, where the complex&#8217;s tenants were able to opt into a program that would share recycling habits monitored by AMP Robotics with the building&#8217;s renters in an effort to improve their recycling behavior.</p>
<p>The potential benefits of AMP <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robot-a0fd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robot-a0fd">Robotic&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> machine learning enabled robots are undeniable. The company&#8217;s technology can sort waste streams in ways that traditional systems never could and at a cost that&#8217;s far lower than most waste handling facilities.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch reported earlier the tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups — the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.</p>
<p>AMP’s robots already have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/colorado" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="colorado">Colorado, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amp-robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="amp-robotics">AMP Robotics </a> worked with its investor, <a href="https://www.sidewalklabs.com/">Sidewalk Labs</a> on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sidewalk-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="sidewalk-labs">Sidewalk Labs</a> is transporting the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics.</p>
<p>Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they’re doing in their recycling efforts.</p>
<p>It was only last November that the Denver-based AMP Robotics raised a $16 million round from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and others to finance the early commercialization of its technology.</p>

<p>As TechCrunch reported at the time, recycling businesses used to be able to rely on China to buy up any waste stream (no matter the quality of the material). However, about two years ago, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/piling-up-how-chinas-ban-on-importing-waste-has-stalled-global-recycling">China decided it would no longer serve as the world’s garbage dump</a> and put strict standards in place for the kinds of raw materials it would be willing to receive from other countries.</p>
<p>The result has been higher costs at recycling facilities, which actually are now required to sort their garbage more effectively. At the time, unemployment rates put the squeeze on labor availability at facilities where trash was sorted. Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has put even more pressure on those recycling and waste handling facilities, despite their identification as &#8220;essential workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given the economic reality, recyclers are turning to AMP’s technology — a combination of computer vision, machine learning and robotic automation to improve efficiencies at their facilities.</p>
<p>And, the power of AMP&#8217;s technology to identify waste products in a stream has other benefits, according to chief executive Matanya Horowitz.</p>
<p>“We can identify… whether it’s a Coke or Pepsi can or a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/starbucks" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="starbucks">Starbucks <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> cup,” Horowitz told TechCrunch last year. “So that people can help design their product for circularity… we’re building out our reporting capabilities and that, to them, is something that is of high interest.”</p>
<p>AMP Robotics declined to comment for this article.</p>

<p>The Bangalore-based startup’s Series B was led by London-headquartered private equity firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apis-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apis-partners">Apis Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (which invested through its Growth Fund II), with participation from existing investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Smilegate Investments. The new round brings the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/cashfree-raises-5-5m/">startup’s to-date raise to $42 million</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cashfree.com/">Cashfree</a> kickstarted its journey in 2015 as a solution for restaurants in Bangalore that needed an efficient way for their delivery personnel to collect cash from customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Akash Sinha and Reeju Datta, the founders of Cashfree, did not have any prior experience with payments. When their merchants asked if they could build a service to accept payments online, the founders quickly realized that Cashfree could serve a wider purpose.</p>
<p>In the early days, Cashfree also struggled to court investors, many of whom did not think a payments processing firm could grow big &#8212; and do so fast enough. But the startup’s fate changed after Y Combinator accepted its application, even though the founders had missed the deadline and couldn’t arrive to join the batch on time. Y Combinator later financed Cashfree’s seed round.</p>

<p>Fast-forward five years, Cashfree today offers more than a dozen products and services and helps over 55,000 businesses disburse salary to employees, accept payments online, set up recurring payments and settle marketplace commissions.</p>
<p>Some of its customers include financial services startup Cred, online grocer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bigbasket-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bigbasket-com">BigBasket, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> food delivery platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> insurers HDFC Ergo and Acko and travel ticketing service provider Ixigo. The startup works with several banks and also offers integrations with platforms such as Shopify, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon Pay.</p>
<p>Based on its offerings, Cashfree today competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/setu-raises-15m-to-help-developers-connect-with-banks-to-offer-indians-sachet-sized-financial-products/">scores</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">startups</a>, but it has an edge &#8212; if not many. Cashfree has been profitable for the past three years, Sinha, who serves as the startup’s chief executive, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Cashfree has maintained a leadership position in this space and is now going through a period of rapid growth fuelled by the development of unique and innovative products that serve the needs of its customers,” Udayan Goyal, co-founder and a managing partner at Apis, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup processed over $12 billion in payments volumes in the financial year that ended in March. Sinha said part of the fresh fund will be deployed in R&amp;D so that Cashfree can scale its technology stack and build more services, including those that can digitize more offline payments for its clients.</p>

<p>Cashfree is also working on building cross-border payments solutions to explore opportunities in emerging markets, he said.</p>
<p>“We still see payments as an evolving industry with its own challenges and we would be investing in next-gen payments as well as banking tech to make payments processing easier and more reliable. With the solid foundation of in-house technologies, tech-driven processes and in-depth industry knowledge, we are confident of growing Cashfree to be the leader in the payments space in India and internationally,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, <a href="https://www.alivecor.com/">AliveCor</a>, a nine-year-old, 92-person company whose small, personal electrocardiogram devices help users detect atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and tachycardia from heart rate readings taken from their own kitchen tables, raised $65 million from investors.</p>
<p>Today, it&#8217;s clearer why investors &#8212; who&#8217;ve now provided the Mountain View, Ca., company with $169 million altogether &#8212;  are excited about its prospects. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alivecor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alivecor">AliveCor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just received its newest FDA clearance under the agency&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/software-medical-device-samd">software as a medical device </a>designation for an upgrade that generates enough detail and fidelity that AliveCor says its cardiological services can now serve as stand-in for the vast majority of cases when cardiac patients are not in front of their doctor.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company says the FDA-cleared update can detect premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, sinus rhythm with wide QRS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a world where the pandemic continues to rage and people remain hesitant to visit a hospital, these little steps add up. In fact, CEO Priya Abani, along with AliveCor founder and chief medical officer David Albert, formerly the chief clinical scientist of cardiology at GE, say AliveCor&#8217;s &#8220;Kardia&#8221; devices have been used to record nearly 15 million EKG recordings since March of this year, which is up over 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>They also claim a 25% increase year-over-year in what they call physician-patient connections, meaning doctors specifically asking their patients to use the device, either at their medical office or at the patient&#8217;s home. Indeed, the pair says that while the company has focused historically on consumer sales, so much new business is coming through doctor referrals that roughly one out of every two of its devices is now sold through these recommendations.</p>
<p>Patients still need to pay out of pocket for AliveCor&#8217;s personal EKG devices, one of which currently sells for $89 while a more sophisticated model sells for $139.</p>
<p>The company also more recently rolled out a subscription product for $99 per year that &#8220;unlocks&#8221; additional features, including monthly summaries of a customer&#8217;s heart data, and hopefully soon, says Abani, access to cardiologists who will be able to answer questions in lieu of one&#8217;s own cardiologist.</p>
<p>Abani &#8212; who joined AliveCor last year from Amazon, where she was a general manager and director of Alexa &#8212; says other offerings are also in the works that should help customers measure their hypertension and blood pressure. She adds that the company more broadly sees itself as becoming a way for people to manage chronic conditions from home and that, if things go AliveCor&#8217;s way, employers will begin offering the service to employees as a way for them to take better care of their own heart health.</p>
<p>In the meantime, AliveCor&#8217;s bigger push into the enterprise appears tied not only to COVID and its ripple effects but also to competition on the consumer front from Apple Watch, which also now enables wearers to records the electrical pulses that make one&#8217;s heart beat and to determine whether the upper and lower chambers are their heart are in rhythm.</p>
<p>Though AliveCor has sung Apple&#8217;s praises for raising awareness around heart health, last year owing to shrinking sales, AliveCor stopped making an earlier product called the KardiaBand that was an FDA-cleared ECG wristband designed for use with Apple Watches.</p>
<p>AliveCor&#8217;s products are currently sold in 12 countries, including India, South Korea, and Germany, and it has clearance to sell in more than 37 altogether.</p>
<p>In addition to selling directly to customers through its site, its devices are available to buy through Best Buy, CVS, and Walgreens.</p>
<p>Very worth noting: Neither Apple nor AliveCor can detect actual heart attacks. While both can detect atrial fibrillation, acute heart attacks are not associated with atrial fibrillation.</p>

But if Americans were expecting an election week, November stretched on into a month of election drama, with President Trump mounting an unprecedented effort to undermine election results and stall the transition process, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/23/937802054/trump-is-running-out-of-time-as-key-states-set-to-certify-that-biden-won">states certified Biden&#8217;s win</a>.</p>
<p>President Trump at last appeared to accept the election results Monday, but not in so many words. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a concession speech, but it was probably the closest thing yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same,&#8221; Trump tweeted, seeming to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1331013212377116673">contradict a fresh claim</a> made by GSA Administrator Emily Murphy that the White House did not influence her decision to block the transition. The General Services Administration (GSA) plays a role in making election results official and moving the transition forward on the federal level.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8230;fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1331013908971261953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>President-elect Biden&#8217;s transition work proceeded in spite of the roadblocks, with the incoming leader introducing aspects of his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03207-2">plan to get COVID-19 under control</a> and working out the names of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/us/politics/biden-antony-blinken-secretary-of-state.html">officials he plans to appoint</a>. But with the head of the GSA refusing to release $6.3 million in federal funds for the transition, Biden&#8217;s hands were tied in some important ways. Murphy&#8217;s extremely unusual refusal to recognize the election results also blocked the president-elect&#8217;s ability to access secure government devices and receive briefings from federal agencies, including those involved in the pandemic response.</p>
<p>Apart from getting Biden&#8217;s transition on track, Trump&#8217;s words and GSA&#8217;s belated cooperation could help the nation move on in another important way. For weeks, election conspiracies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/">roiled the internet</a>, inspiring a number of Trump supporters to denounce mainstream social networks, which reminded users of the election results and cracked down on some forms of misinformation. Those conspiracy theories were often spread right from the top, with President Trump promoting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/trump-s-election-attacks-put-voting-tech-firm-in-the-crosshairs">baseless claims</a> of fraud involving mail-in ballots and voting machines as he refused to concede.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s online supporters may not move on from the election quickly, but they&#8217;re likely to follow his lead — and for now at least, it looks like Trump will signal defeat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2020, parents and guardians are super spoilt for choice in the STEM toys gift department &#8212; which is great news in the midst of a pandemic that&#8217;s supercharging homeschooling needs. The category has matured to offer an interesting range of options for children across a wide span of ages, shedding some of its earlier reliance on Disney IP in favor of more original ideas. Below, we&#8217;ve rounded up 20+ gift ideas to get the (robotic) ball rolling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true the educational value of &#8220;learn to code&#8221; gizmos remains hard to quantify. And some price tags can seem tricky to justify. But there&#8217;s no doubt a lot of thought has gone on creating child-friendly product design and into chunking and structuring the learning. The short story is there&#8217;s plenty to intrigue and inspire developing minds, even if there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll have a future Googler on your hands. (But that&#8217;s okay; maybe your kid will invent the <em>next</em> paradigm-shifting platform?)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also good to see attention continuing to be paid to encouraging children to explore art &amp; design, not just get their heads around engineering &amp; science concepts. Maybe in the coming years we&#8217;ll get a little STEM ethics thrown into the mix &#8212; to further round-out the learning potential. While there&#8217;s clear value in kids understanding how digital tools work under the hood, helping the next generation appreciate that connectivity can change people&#8217;s behavior and reshape the world around them looks no less important a lesson to learn.</p>

The Pi-powered machine runs Raspbian OS and comes preloaded with STEM-friendly software, including Scratch, Python and Minecraft, so little coders can get to grips with block-based and more sophisticated programming languages once the computer has been put together. The kit also includes a breadboard for building electronics projects. (NB: The basic box needs an HDMI-capable TV to act as a monitor for the computer, or there&#8217;s a $300 bundle that comes with a monitor.)</p>

<p>For parents looking for screen-free STEM toys <a href="https://www.learningresources.com/botleyr-the-coding-robot-2-activity-set">Botley 2.0</a> is worth a look. The battery-powered rolling-and-sensing programmable robot comes with a remote control for coding directional sequences (of up to 150 steps) via simple button pressing. There&#8217;s also a loops button to introduce the coding principle of recycling a previous sequence.</p>
<p>Botley&#8217;s maker, Learning Resources, has updated the robot for 2020 with new interactions, color-changing eyes and night vision so it can carry on line-sensing in the dark. There are also new programming sequences for kids to discover that transform the bot into fresh characters &#8212; such as a train, police car, ghost and frog &#8212; expressed via different sounds and movements. The kit also includes a 78-piece activity set so kids can devise obstacle courses for Botley to navigate.</p>

The online educational game — called <a href="https://codeillusion.io">Disney Codeillusion</a> — is billed as teaching four coding languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Processing), with a focus on visual arts thanks to the inclusion of Disney&#8217;s animated movie characters. The content features the usual cartoon suspects &#8212; from Queen Elsa and Aladdin to Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>The web-based course is definitely not a cheap option — and requires an internet connection via a desktop computer (not a mobile device) to work — costing $500 for a package that excludes any physical merch and also strips out some other digital elements (such as an RPG game). The package with all the bells &amp; whistles (aka the &#8220;Enchanted&#8221; edition) weighs in at $900. But with 125 lessons (averaging 30 minutes a pop), kids should at least be kept busy working on their code creations for some time &#8212; which might be magic enough for parents stuck homeschooling during a pandemic.</p>
<p>There is also a free seven-day trial to get a taster of lesson content before committing to shell out.</p>

<p>As we noted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gift-guide-stem-toys-for-your-builders-in-training/">last year’s gift guide</a>, U.K. STEM learning startup Kano has pivoted from selling Raspberry Pi-powered build-it-yourself computer kits to a more convention &#8220;my child’s first PC&#8221; proposition. The Windows-based plug-in-the-bits-and-play <a href="https://kano.me/eu/store/products/kano-pc">Kano PC</a> is aimed at parents who want to set their child on the path to STEM learning in a more mainstream computing environment. At $300 the laptop-slash-tablet is hardly a &#8220;toy&#8221; but the advantage of shelling out for a fully fledged computer is increased utility &#8212; and, hopefully, longevity. Kano touts the PC as capable of running “thousands” of applications.</p>
<p>Of most relevance to the STEM side, it comes preloaded with Kano’s <a href="https://kano.me/eu/downloadable">Software Studio package</a>: A set of learning tools geared toward teaching kids design, science, coding and creativity &#8220;in simple and fun ways&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>

<p>For very young kids point your peepers at <a href="https://kumiita.com/eng/">Kumiita</a>. The educational toy for kids who haven&#8217;t even reached their first birthday began as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1599191780/kumiita-educational-programming-toy-for-0-year-old">Kickstarter</a> side-project. Now its Japanese maker is selling the gizmo globally, via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/KUMIITA/page/FCBE5355-B75C-4497-8B52-7F379AE9EA03?ref_=ast_bln">Amazon</a>. The idea is to teach foundational programming concepts via screen-free (and internet-free), tile-based floor play.</p>
<p>A battery-powered robot — Kumiita — responds to pictorial instructions on the tiles. Kids choose which tiles to place to &#8220;program&#8221; the robot — getting immediate feedback on their sequence as the bot twirls, changes colour, plays animal sounds or moves off in a new direction. If the bot falls off the pathway there’s obviously a problem and kids have to set about &#8220;debugging&#8221; by changing their choice of tiles. That in turn encourages problem solving and sequential thinking. Tiles in some of the packs also introduce conditional coding concepts.</p>

Instead, the <a href="https://shop.learnwithexplore.com/products/mindlabs-energy-and-circuits">MindLabs: Energy and Circuits</a> pack has kids play with a set of physical cards &#8212; viewing them through the screen of a tablet where they get to build out circuits that are brought to life digitally via the companion app. The kit offers 20+ interactive lessons with step-by-step instructions on basic circuit concepts. (NB: Children will need access to a tablet.)</p>
<p>The approach offers a relatively affordable way for kids to learn about electronics components and concepts through (virtual) trial and error &#8212; though clearly if it&#8217;s a screen-free toy you&#8217;re after, this isn&#8217;t it. An added advantage is children are able to collaborate remotely with friends for group learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Austrian STEM toy maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/robo-wunderkind-wants-to-build-the-lego-mindstorms-for-everyone/">Robo Wunderkind</a> has updated its programmable robotics kits for 2020 with new sensor modules, including an LED display block that can show designs or display scrolling text; a line-follower block so the bots can detect and follow lines; and an accelerometer block to give them spacial awareness.</p>
<p>For those not already familiar with the STEM toy, kids snap together the magnetic blocks to build sensor-laden robots and program them via a drag-and-drop coding interface in the companion app.</p>
<p>Blocks can be combined in multiple ways to build different sensing objects &#8212; from rolling robots to smart flashlights. The cheapest kit comes with six modules and 10 guided projects, while the top-of-the-range Explorer Pro kit ($400) has 15 modules and 30 projects. The blocks are also compatible with Lego pieces so children can augment the design of their constructions with additional elements if they have a few bricks lying around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, this one is going to be a different<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/gift-guide-gifts-for-the-promising-podcaster/"> from last year</a>. Because everything is different from last year. I know 2020 has been a pretty big change for my own personal podcast. I always prefer conducting interviews in person when I’m able — in fact, around 400 or so episodes were done exactly like that.</p>
<p>But face-to-face interviews are going to continue to be a non-starter for the foreseeable future, so I’ve had to switch the show to a virtual setup. It’s less than ideal for my own creative and aesthetic preferences, but when the world shifts radically, you do your best to adapt along with it.</p>
<p>For me, that’s meant a couple of things. First — and most obviously — shifting from in-person interviews to virtual ones. Another more surprising (for me) aspect has been the addition of a video element. I’ve started doing it less frequently, but I’ve incorporated YouTube live-streaming into my repertoire. After all, most of my interviews are done over Zoom, with the video stripped out. Sometimes it’s fun to do both.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So here’s a good place to start for the podcaster in your life — whether they’re just starting out or looking to make the transition to remote streaming.</p>

<p>This one is a repeat from last year, mostly because I’ve been using the heck out of it. AKG’s mic has become my go-to for podcasts and meetings alike. I’ve used it for television appearances, Disrupt panels and a recent guest hosting appearance on NPR. It sounds good, has simple-to-understand settings, plug-and-play functionality and it looks great.</p>

<p>The thing about webcams is that there are a lot of them. The other thing about them is they’re mostly pretty cheap. Logitech’s StreamCam is pretty pricey as far as the category goes. Many or most of these products can be had for around $100 or less. The StreamCam comes at a premium — but you get a lot of camera for that price.</p>
<p>It’s probably overkill for most scenarios (see also: our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gift-guide-7-great-gifts-for-anyone-working-from-home/">work from home gift guide</a>), but it delivers really solid streaming quality in a compact package. That includes 1080p video at 60fps, with face tracking and good low-light shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/streamcam.960-001289.html#buy-streamcam">$170 from Logitech</a></p>

<p>Okay, this one is less exciting, but man oh man is it important. I suspect most amateur podcasters don’t even consider a wind screen, but after listening to a bit of level-spiking sibilance, you’ll understand exactly why this microphone add-on is so important.</p>
<p>I was using another model until its recent, untimely demise. I just picked this one up for $12 on Amazon and it’s been great. There’s a clamp at the bottom that attaches to most USB mics (including the Blue Yeti and the above AKG). The arm is also super flexible, which is the biggest issue I had with the older model.</p>

<p>This is the light ring that made most of our staff look great during our first-ever virtual Disrupt. It’s been sitting in the corner of my living room for several months now, and I utilize it for both video streams and meetings.</p>
<p>Like anything involving stills or video, lighting is incredibly important, and the GVM is a real powerhouse with a stated 70,000 hours of life. It’s intense and adjustable/dimmable, offering really solid realistic color settings.</p>

<p>Another returning item from last year. And honestly, this one is a bit hopeful that some day soon we’ll all be comfortable talking at each other in cramped spaces again. But the RODEcaster Pro is honestly just too good not to include here.</p>
<p>The RODEcaster Pro is a multi-channel mixing board that saves up to four mics&#8217; worth of input (along with effects and guest phone calls via Bluetooth) to an SD card, which will greatly assist in any post-podcast processing. I’m happy to retire it from my list when another podcasting board can offer similar functionality with such an accessible interface and reasonable price. Until then, the RODEcaster Pro continues to be the best way to quickly up your podcasting game.</p>

<p>Your results will vary, but I know a lot of folks who rely on Zencastr for remote recording. The interface is great, recording each track remotely, offering levels in-real time and uploading them to the servicer. Files are saved as lossless .wavs and separated by guest.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is committing $1 billion in production spend at its ABQ Studios in Albuquerque, New Mexico, along with plans to expand those studios, the company said.</p>
<p>In an announcement alongside New Mexico&#8217;s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, Netflix&#8217;s chief executive <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ted-sarandos" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ted-sarandos">Ted Sarandos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said the company would add 300 acres to its existing space in ABQ Studios, creating one of the largest film production facilities in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That means roughly 1,000 new production jobs in New Mexico over the next 10 years, the company predicted, and an additional 1,467 construction jobs to complete the expansion.</p>
<p>“My administration has expanded our state’s competitive film incentives, facilitating higher-wage employment for New Mexicans all across the state, and increased opportunities for rural communities,” said Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>The proposed expansion and $150 million in capital expenditures will add 10 new stages, post-production services, mills, backlots and training facilities, wardrobe suites, a commissary and other flexible buildings.</p>
<p>New Mexico&#8217;s government is providing $17 million in funding and the city of Albuquerque is providing another $7 million in financing, including $6 million in infrastructure in-kind financing.</p>
<p>The city is also issuing bonds to abate property and other taxes over a 20-year term to cover the first $500 million investment by Netflix to build out the production facility.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Netflix has also agreed to lease 130 acres from the State Land Office in addition to the private purchase of another 170 acres.</p>
<p>New Mexico&#8217;s Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary, Alicia J. Keyes, said the deal could ultimately result in $2.5 billion worth of spending in the state.</p>
<p>Netflix also committed to supporting the state&#8217;s indigenous, Latino, Black and other underrepresented content creators and filmmakers.</p>
<p>Productions filming in New Mexico currently include &#8220;The Harder They Fall&#8221; and &#8220;Intrusion&#8221; &#8212; and the company expects to begin shooting the next season of &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; in the state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s just get this out of the way: For the past several years, I’ve contributed the “Best Gifts for Frequent Travelers” segment to TechCrunch’s annual gift guide. I love it. It was easily my favorite gift guide to write, and it was an audience favorite, as well. But I am no longer a frequent traveler. I’ve left New York City exactly once since March. Odds are that special person in your life isn’t traveling much, either.</p>
<p>So, in honor of this new sedentary life to which we’ve all grown accustomed over the past eight or nine months, I’m bringing you the polar opposite. This, friends, is the gift guide for those who have come to carve out office space in their homes. For everyone who’s come to blur the important lines between work and personal life.</p>
<p>The transition hasn’t been an easy one for everyone, but here are a handful of gifts that can help ease the transition and make someone’s home office a…well, a home, I guess. They’re not necessarily the most fun gifts, but odds are someone in your life can really use them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>I never truly appreciated the value of a good office chair until this pandemic. I’ve been lucky to work for a corporation that considers Herman Millers a necessary expense. I honestly can’t remember which manner of ratty Amazon bargain bin chair I had held onto for the last several years, but a month or two into this, I rolled it into the donation pile.</p>
<p>There’s truth in the conventional wisdom that you get what you pay for when it comes to office chairs. And, indeed, it’s an investment. But there are deals to be had. I didn’t spend an arm or leg, so I’m not going to encourage you to. After a good amount of research, I landed on this beast from Staples. It’s big and comfortable and offers great full body support that won’t leave you sore after eight hours in front of the computer (I mean, do get up and move around at least once an hour for your health and sanity).</p>
<p>Best of all, it’s almost shockingly affordable.</p>

<p>Remember how I told you I wasn’t going to encourage you to spend an arm and a leg on the chair? Well, consider this a gift for the person in your life who was really good this year. If a good office chair is an investment, a computer is a lifeline. I wouldn’t recommend an iMac for, say, a 3D designer, but for many or most, you can’t really argue with ease of use for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> all-in-one.</p>

<p>Apple refreshed the system earlier this year, with some improved features, including, notably, an improved webcam — that’s obviously an important upgrade these days. There are no external monitors to deal with and minimal futzing required out of the box. There is, of course, a big Apple Silicon redesign coming in the next year or two, but that won’t do you a whole lot of good in the meantime.</p>

<p>Much like the office chair, Webcams were one of those those things I really didn’t pay much mind to before the pandemic. But the truth is this: Built-in webcams, as a category, suck. There are exceptions to this, of course, but unlike with smartphone makers, cameras have nearly universally been an afterthought with PC manufacturers. I do suspect there’s a good chance this will finally shift in the next year or so, but for now, you really want to avoid using your computer’s built-in camera for those important Zoom meetings, if you can.</p>
<p>There are a ton of options out there, and you can get a decent webcam at a decent price — Logitech is usually a pretty solid choice. This time out, however, I’m giving the prize to Razer. The gaming company has delivered a clever and versatile camera. It’s got an adjustable clip/stand, can capture video at 1080p @ 30FPS / 720p @ 60FPS and, best of all, there’s a built-in light ring. It’s not going to replace a pro-level camera set up, obviously, if they do a lot of conference appearances or frequently appear on CNN. But if they’re looking to liven up a Zoom call or two, this is a solid choice.</p>

<p>Okay, so, as a longtime podcaster this is something I’ve been thinking about well before the pandemic started. The truth is a decent set of headphones should double as an okay meeting mic. But if conference calls are central to work days, a good mic is a great way to up that game. And hey, everyone’s starting a podcast these days, right?</p>
<p>RØDE has some great USB mic options. The NT-USB Mini wouldn’t be my first (or probably even tenth) choice for podcasting. But its price and size make it a nice option for augmenting meetings and other calls. It also has the advantage of size and a removable stand that will make it a good travel companion if we’re able to travel again.</p>

<p>Living in Queens at the height of the pandemic in New York — and dealing with my own personal health issues — I basically didn’t leave my apartment in April or May. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitnesscubed" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitnesscubed">Cubii’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sit down elliptical isn’t a replacement for full-body exercise, but it’s a nice supplement, if you’re housebound for any reason.</p>

<p>Headphones are necessary for working from home, but I’d also recommend getting a semi-decent speaker for your desk. A smart speaker is likely the path of least resistance for listening to streaming services like Spotify, and Nest Audio is probably the most well-rounded of the bunch. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Assistant is great for all of the smart stuff and the new hardware sounds really solid.</p>

<p>Did I need to spend $200 on a seltzer maker? No, of course not. Do I regret spending $200 on a seltzer maker? Also no. Aarke’s system looks great, has a solid build and pulling down that hand crank is decidedly satisfying. Hydration is important, friends. Honorable mention to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/self-cleaning-water-bottle-company-larq-raises-a-10m-series-a/">LARQ</a> UV disinfecting bottle.

<p>Bonus entry, this one from TechCrunch Editor Greg Kumparak:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been working from home for a few years now, and honestly the most important change I&#8217;ve made this year is vastly improving my home office&#8217;s lighting situation. Lighting — both natural and artificial — is hugely important to how we feel throughout the day, and being able to customize the lights to your exact likings is one of the huge plusses of working from home. No more awful flickering fluorescent lights! Want to make the lights purple and blue? You do you.</p>
<p>Smart lighting lets you do fancy things like shifting the colors to those that make you feel alert/productive, or dim them as evening approaches. During the California wildfires, when smoke and haze dyed the sky a terrifying orange, I shifted all of my lighting to be <em>way </em>more blue than it otherwise would be to help my brain realize it was the afternoon and not, as it seemed, an impossibly long sunrise.</p>
<p>Philips Hue bulbs are a solid pick, generally. They offer a ton of flexibility and options, the downside being that they&#8217;re generally on the more expensive end. I also don&#8217;t expect Philips to drop support for the Hue line or go out of business any time soon. New competition has been entering the market at lower price points, but my hesitation there is always how well they&#8217;ll be supported in the years to come.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;ve already got other smart lights around their house though, try to stick within the same brand. It makes things considerably easier to not have to deal with new hubs, apps, etc.</p></blockquote>

		Matheus is a hedge funds investment analyst for a major global investment manager and technology provider. In prior roles, he was an associate at a LatAm-focused venture capital firm and worked in corporate venture with regional banks and the Brazilian stock exchange. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Since 2007, the number of publicly listed companies in Brazil has decreased <a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/bolsas-e-indices/noticia/2019/11/14/numero-de-empresas-na-bolsa-e-o-menor-desde-1996.ghtml">from 400 to just a little over 300</a>.</p>
<p>In the past six years there were only 21 IPOs — an average of just 3.5 public exits per year; by 2019,<a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/listed_companies/"> even Iran had more listed companies than Brazil</a>. Global capital markets are heated given pandemic stimulus packages and low interest rates worldwide, but in Brazil the boom comes with a special feature: in Q3 2020, there were 25 primary and secondary equity offerings, and this year is on track to be the most active in history both in number of deals and dollar volume.</p>
<p>The most important event, however, is not necessarily the reversal of a shrinking public market but the fact that startups are issuing stocks for the first time, a dramatic change for a market previously dominated by industries like commodities and utilities.</p>
<h2>Growth versus value: Revert the shrinking market and internet companies</h2>
<p>Not only is Brazil&#8217;s IPO market roaring, the waitlist is even more impressive: <a href="http://sistemas.cvm.gov.br/asp/cvmwww/ciasabertas/registros/formRegCias.asp">More than 47 companies have filed at CVM</a> (equivalent to the the Securities and Exchange Commission) to issue equity and are waiting for approval. In other words, the IPO is equivalent to more than 15% of the number of publicly listed companies. In the first half of October, <a href="http://sistemas.cvm.gov.br/asp/cvmwww/ciasabertas/registros/RegistrosAno.asp">six companies were approved to issue equity</a>. Obviously construction and retail names are still predominant as they take advantage of the lower rates, but the main novelty are new entrants in internet and technology.</p>
<p>In the past decade, <a href="http://www.b3.com.br/data/files/70/11/B3/BC/A9FF47102C784E47AC094EA8/Ofertas_Publicas__Imprensa__-_Setembro.20__SITE_.xlsx">there were 56 IPOs in Brazil and only two were in the software space, both in 2013.</a> That is a reflection of the profile of the investors who dominate local markets, which are used to allocating assets to companies in sectors like oil, paper and cellulose, mining or utilities. Historically, publicly listed companies in the country were value plays, as few of them had significant exposure to the domestic market and derived a significant share of revenue from commodities and exports.</p>
<p>As a result, companies that focused on the domestic market or on growth were never quite embraced by local investors. Many investors deploying capital in Brazil were mostly foreign and very risk-averse to the dynamics of the domestic market; in 2007, when Brazil went through a similar IPO boom, <a href="https://www.euqueroinvestir.com/onda-ipo-2020-entenda/">70 percent of the demand for equity offerings came from foreign investors.</a></p>
<p>Along with an undervalued currency, growth companies struggled to find attractive valuations on the local exchange. As a result, growth companies such as Stone Payments, Netshoes, PagSeguro, Arco Educação and XP Investimentos <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2019/08/20/em-tres-anos-empresas-brasileiras-ja-levantaram-mais-de-us-5-bilhoes-nos-eua.ghtml">did their IPOs in New York</a> where they attained higher valuations. It&#8217;s ironic that there were three times more IPOs of Brazilian growth companies in the U.S. in the past five years than there were in the domestic market in the last decade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two large job search and recruiting platforms are coming together, with <a href="http://vettery.com">Vettery</a> acquiring <a href="https://hired.com">Hired</a>.</p>
<p>The news follows a report last week in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/job-site-hired-once-valued-at-500-million-discusses-winding-down">The Information</a> claiming that Hired had begun to sell off its assets and wind down the company. The report also stated that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hired" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hired">Hired <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Mehul Patel &#8220;abruptly resigned&#8221; via Zoom in early October.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement simply says that Patel is moving on &#8220;to pursue new opportunities,&#8221; with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vettery" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vettery">Vettery <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Josh Brenner becoming chief executive of the combined companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brenner told me that the two platforms are largely complementary, with only a 5% overlap in their respective customer bases. Hired, he said, has built AI job-matching tools (as well as talent assessment and bias reduction features) that are particularly well-suited for software and engineering positions, while Vettery offers &#8220;a little bit more breadth in the verticals that we support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key is bringing scale to these marketplaces,&#8221; Brenner said. &#8220;We see this as a formidable competitor to any of the legacy hiring solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077676" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077676" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077676" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?w=680" alt="Hired and Vettery logos" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077676" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vettery</p></div></p>
<p>The plan, he added, is to create a single &#8220;unified solution&#8221; that brings together the best of both platforms. Vettery says this solution will offer job-matching AI that draws on combined data from 1.5 million interviews and more than 21,000 job placements.</p>
<p>Asked whether the combined site would operate under the Hired or Vettery brand name, Brenner said, &#8220;We believe there will be one brand in the future. Right now, we’re continuing to keep both brands while we do the research to figure out what the best approach is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hired was founded in 2012 and raised more than $130 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hired">according to Crunchbase</a>. Vettery, meanwhile, launched in 2014 and was itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/20/adecco-acquires-vettery/">acquired two years ago by HR services firm Adecco Group</a>.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Asked how many Hired employees would be joining Vettery, Brenner said it was too early in the transition to specify, but he added, &#8220;Not only does Hired have a great client base, they&#8217;ve also got an amazing team that we’ve admired as well and gotten to know over the last period of time &#8230; so we’re extremely hopeful that we can bring together as many of those talented people as possible.&#8221;</p>
