										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European satellite and communications startup, <a href="https://hiber.global/">Hiber BV</a> has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand its IoT satellite network.  The funding comes from the European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), the EU’s innovation agency, which has a €278 million Innovation Fund. The EIC co-invested with an innovation credit provided by the Dutch government and existing shareholders. Other investors include Finch Capital, Netherlands Enterprise Agency and Hartenlust Group. Hiber’s satellite constellation tracks and monitors machines and devices in harder-to-reach places.</p>
<p>At the same time co-founder of Hiber, Laurens Groenendijk, is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives” the company said in a statement. Steven Kroonsberg joins as CFO. Roel Jansen joins as CCO. Groenendijk has been Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer at Treatwell as well as a serial investor.</p>
<p>Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector. It is a key step in realizing our aim of making the Internet of Things really simple and available for everyone in remote and developing regions of the world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, because it can reach out-of-the-way areas, Hiber&#8217;s network may be able to reduce losses in food production and leakages from oil wells.</p>
<p>Nicklas Bergman, European Innovation Council Fund Committee Member, commented: “I am glad to announce the EIC Fund support to this highly innovative company aiming at creating a European champion in the satellite Internet of Things sector. This equity financing will help Hiber to enable affordable and ubiquitous connectivity for the IoT solutions.”</p>
<p>Elia Montanari, Head of Management and Control at the European Space Agency, commented: “This major success has been supported at European level by collaboration of major EU bodies (EIC, EIB, ESA) fostering the Space Value Chain”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many work teams, especially stores and restaurants, rely on manual spreadsheets to ensure their operations are running smoothly. Based in Singapore, <a href="https://hellonimbly.com/">Nimbly</a> develops software that automates more of that process. Its features include digital checklists, inventory management and field audits that can be accessed through a mobile app. The startup announced today it has raised $4.6 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Insignia Ventures Partners, with participation from Sovereign’s Capital and Saison Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Daniel Hazman and Jonathan Keith, Nimbly is currently used by more than one hundred organizations in seven countries, including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. Most of Nimbly’s users are in the retail or food and beverage industries, and include KFC, Kopi Kenangan, 7-Eleven and Under Armour. Some clients also come from the fast-moving consumer goods and agriculture sectors, like Cargill and Wilmar.</p>
<p>The new funding brings its total raised to $5.7 million and will be used for Nimbly’s Southeast Asia expansion, including a new partnership with restaurant operator Express Food Group, and adding products like more analytics, mystery shopper and employee training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nimbly is designed to replace spreadsheets, emails and messaging apps by combining their functionalities into one app. This includes checklists, audits and live video to ensure that standard operating procedures are followed across all locations. For example, restaurants may use Nimbly to see if food safety and hygiene standards are being followed. FMCG companies can use it to track inventory at stores and share information about how their sales and promotions compare to competitors, while use cases for agriculture include verifying that suppliers are following sustainability measure at their farms.</p>
<p>In a statement, Insignia Venture Partners founding managing partner Yinglan Tan said, “SaaS enterprise is an emerging vertical in Southeast Asia with more businesses of all sizes and across industries seeking to transition and even upgrade their capabilities to software tools. That makes us very excited to have partnered with Daniel, Jonathan and their team at Nimbly as they lead this space in building software stack capable of serving the operational needs of companies first in Southeast Asia, and then globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vienna-based GoStudent, which connects students to tutors on a virtual learning platform, has raised a €70M Series B funding round led by new US investor Coatue. Coatue has been making &#8216;raids&#8217; into the European startup scene for the past year or so. It was joined by existing investors Left Lane Capital and DN Capital. This brings the total amount raised to €83.3M.</p>
<p>GoStudent competes with offline players like Schülerhilfe in Germany and Acadomia in France, which focus on small-classes in learning centers. By doing it online, GoStudent can introduce cost savings for users. It also competes where tutors advertise in traditional marketplaces like classified ads. The offering is similar to Chinese players like Zhangmen, VIPKid, TAL Education.</p>
<p>The investment will be used for growth and expansion into international markets such as Turkey and Greece. GoStudent is aiming for 15 countries across Europe and to grow its team to +800 employees and +10,000 tutors. It claims that over 250,000 tutoring sessions are booked every month on its platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The acquisition, for which terms remain undisclosed and is still subject to regulatory approval, sees Finch create a new Ireland-registered entity called Nomu Pay.</p>
<p>After facing a huge accounting scandal and failing to make payments on its own loans, Wirecard went into insolvency last year. Since then, various parts of its business have been bought, including one of its largest assets, Wirecard Solutions, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/railsbank-wirecard/">acquired by the U.K.&#8217;s Railsbank</a>.</p>

<p>Finch&#8217;s managing partner Radboud Vlaar tells me Noma Pay’s larger plan is to invest in payments infrastructure in Turkey and the Middle East region. He says that more details will be provided on the new entity&#8217;s strategy and branding once the deal has formally closed.</p>
<p>Explains Vlaar: &#8220;We see tremendous  growth opportunities to further enhance payments for Turkey&#8217;s 80 million inhabitants. We are excited to team up with Wirecard Turkey under the leadership of its CEO Serkan Yasin and we continue to actively look for further M&amp;A opportunities in the region to accelerate its growth and development&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wirecard Turkey (Wirecard Ödeme ve Elektronik Para Hizmetleri A.Ş.) was established in Turkey in July 2008 and started its operations the following year as the country&#8217;s first &#8220;direct carrier billing&#8221; service provider. In 2014, it was wholly acquired by Wirecard Issuing &amp; Acquiring Gmbh, which is a subsidiary of Wirecard AG.</p>
<p>Today, the Turkish company provides various payment services, namely: direct carrier billing, credit card acquiring, and e-money. It has contracts with all three GSM operators and the majority of banks in Turkey, and more than 1,200 merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is great talent in Turkey to build a leading next generation payments company,&#8221; adds Vlaar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Men’s health and wellbeing startup <a href="https://www.manual.co/">Manual</a> has raised a $30m Series A round from US-based Sonoma Brands and Waldencast, and Manual’s existing European investors Felix Capital and Cherry Ventures. FJ Labs and the GISEV Family Office also participated in the round. The cash will be used for product development and international expansion. Manual provides diagnostics, treatments and ongoing care and plans to expand across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company has already expanded to Brazil.</p>
<p>Manual is competing with Numan (raised $13M), also from the UK (Manual launched a month earlier than them). In the US it is competing with Ro (raised $876.1M) and Hims (listed). All these brands tend to focus on issues like vitamins and erectile dysfunction, with the, often common refrain of, ‘normalizing’ the idea that men should look after themselves better, across a number of fronts and removing stigma’s around sexual health. It performs blood tests and other tests to analyze heart health, gut health, testosterone, sleep, energy, and immunity. They are pushing at a large market, as men historically avoid doctors.</p>

<p>George Pallis, CEO and Founder, previously led marketing at Wise and Deliveroo. In a statement he said: “We’ve been encouraged to see men of all ages increasingly turning to Manual to solve multiple health problems, with almost half of our customers seeking help for more than one issue. It’s clear that a health concern may have more than one cause, and we can provide customers with the ability to treat their health in a more holistic way. Using different treatments to understand and improve their wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Speaking to during an interview Pallis added: “We built our own teleconsultation product and have different applications for the blood test offering. When you get your results we will offer a clinician, we&#8217;ll walk you through all the data and the learnings. We offer tools where people can monitor their progress and have regular check-ins with our medical team.”</p>
<p>Antoine Nussenbaum, co-Founder and partner of Felix Capital, commented: “There is still much work to be done to remove the taboo when it comes to men looking after their wellbeing and talking openly about health concerns. But we’re starting to see a shift happen amongst consumers.”</p>
<p>Kevin Murphy, Managing Director of Sonoma Brands, commented: “Manual exists to empower men to take better care of themselves and to live fuller lives by doing so. George and his team have the clarity of vision and the skill to make Manual a leader in this exciting and important area.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-focused talent recruitment and outsourcing company</span><a href="http://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced that it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been accepted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Techstars Toronto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will join nine other startups in the accelerator&#8217;s class of 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes two weeks after Nigerian bus-booking platform Plentywaka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/">announced its participation</a> in the program as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last November by serial entrepreneurs</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adewaleyusuf/?ppe=1"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adewale Yusuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/opeawo"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opeyemi Awoyemi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/hacksultan"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Akintunde Sultan.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before TalentQL, Yusuf co-founded Nigeria-based tech media publication Techpoint Africa; Awoyemi co-founded online recruitment site Jobberman; and Sultan founded nonprofit tech accelerator DevCareer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a &#8220;talent pool&#8221; developers join before passing through different assessments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the engineers pass the assessments, they can join the company&#8217;s &#8220;talent network&#8221; to access opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic accelerated the need for international companies to seek cheaper and remote talent around the world. TalentQL is hoping to tap into what it thinks is a gold mine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Yusuf, the company, which is also U.S.-based, wants to decentralize access and democratize opportunity for Africa&#8217;s top tech talents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of its local clients, TalentQL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assists with recruitment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other model entails hiring vetted engineers for international companies, managing them, and providing tax and health insurance services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re coming to the market to support the talent with health insurance, some tools to work with and a community to be part of. These are some of the offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets us apart from other companies,&#8221; Yusuf said to TechCrunch over a phone call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite that, the company has faced the same challenge that has plagued the space &#8212; the lack of senior engineering talent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When most engineers reach that level of expertise, they tend to leave the country to the U.S. and Europe for better opportunities or, better still, launch their own startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a problem Andela faced in the past, resulting in the layoff of 400 junior developers “due to market demand for more senior engineering talent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yusuf says this is why the company is pursuing a Pan-African and diasporan play (Africans in the U.S. and Europe), hoping to fill in the gap with senior talent from these places</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And to further </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Pan-African ambitions, it is planning to open an office in Kenya in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although TalentQL is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote, Yusuf says this has to happen to establish the right kind of understanding between on-the-ground recruiters and the engineers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want a situation where when we&#8217;re recruiting from other countries, our technical recruiters are from those countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want them to be able to speak the language of these engineers and understand the culture of their countries,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL currently has over 100 tech skills available with more than 2,000 developers on its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These developers cater to clients from the U.S., Europe, Nigeria and Kenya. The CEO says the company is also in talks with some Fortune 500 companies to execute placements for their African expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/11/17/talentql-raises-300k-pre-seed-zedcrest-capital/">$300,000 pre-seed secured last year</a>, the 6-month-old company will receive a $120,000 investment from Techstars. But<span style="font-weight: 400;"> besides the funding, Techstars&#8217; backing will be crucial in two ways, according to Yusuf. First is how it operates going forward in a crowded tech talent marketplace with the likes of Ethiopia&#8217;s Gebeya and Nigeria&#8217;s Decagon and Semicolon. The other would be helping the company to be a global company, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an African one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sunil Sharma, the managing director of Techstars Toronto and an investor in five Nigerian startups, Techstars&#8217; investment in TalentQL gives the accelerator a chance to participate in the burgeoning tech talent space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rise of Nigeria is more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appreciated now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology sectors like finance, mobility and e-commerce, where talented Nigerians are not only bringing innovation and disruption but are doing so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and at scale,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as intriguing is the opportunity relating to talent itself as Nigerians and Africans across the continent are contributing more to supporting tech companies across the world, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://everli.com/">Everli</a>, the European marketplace for online grocery shopping that started in Italy but now also operates in Poland, Czech Republic and France, has raised a $100 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Verlinvest, with participation from new investors Luxor, DN Capital, C4 Ventures, and Convivialité Ventures. FITEC (part of Fondo Italiano d’Investimento), 360 Capital, Innogest, and DIP also followed on.</p>
<p>Everli, formerly called Supermercato24, says it will use the injection of capital to accelerate growth and further expand its international footprint.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2014, Everli lets customers order from local supermarkets for delivery. The company uses gig economy-styled personal shoppers who go into the store and ‘pick’ the products ordered and then deliver them same-day, or for an added cost within an hour. The company charges a delivery fee to consumers, but also generates revenue from fees charged to partnering merchants, and, notably, through advertising.</p>
<p>It has become the delivery partner of some of Europe’s largest grocery brands, offering access to over 300,000 products across the 70 cities it operates in. And, like other online grocery offerings, Everli has benefited from a boost in e-commerce and a reliance on delivery services prompted by the pandemic and country lockdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everli is focused specifically on the grocery space,&#8221; says Federico Sargenti, CEO at Everli. &#8220;Rather than small baskets, or picking up just the basic essentials, Everli is focused on delivering whatever you need right up to your full weekly shop, with same-day delivery and a one-hour delivery window of your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that what further differentiates Everli is its strong relationships with retailers, and the use of their existing infrastructure. &#8220;Instead of being tethered and restricted to a radius around our own expensive central warehouses, we are able to operate across a much wider geographical footprint, entering small-to-medium density areas and offering many customers their first opportunity to receive same day groceries, [all] while retaining sustainable unit economics&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sargenti describes Everli as more similar to Instacart than many other European delivery firms, including the new crop of dark stores or those that offer groceries as a secondary service to takeouts. &#8220;[This is] why we’re leading the grocery space in Europe and securing brands like Lidl, Kaufland, and Carrefour,&#8221; adds Sargenti.</p>
<p>In 2020, Everli sales almost quadrupled to $130 million. That growth is happening more and more outside Italy, with its international expansion now responsible for over 20% of orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to have played a role in helping many people during these difficult times, but we are only getting started, as this industry will never be the same again,&#8221; says Sargenti in a statement. &#8220;The shift to online delivery is not reversing, and expectations on all sides are only increasing. We have built a model which we believe offers unparalleled value to consumers, through wide access to the retailers and products they love, even in less urban areas, and to retailers, who are now able to affordably compete online and reach a whole new consumer base&#8221;.</p>
<p>Adds Simone Sallustio, Executive Director at Verlinvest: “Everli combines its tech &amp; data excellence with the grocery retail experience of its partners and this combination provides it with the perfect position to cement itself as the European e-grocery market leader, delivering the best experience to consumers, value to retail partners, and digital activation to brands&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you develop software for a large enterprise company, chances are you&#8217;ve heard of <a href="https://www.tricentis.com/">Tricentis</a>. If you don&#8217;t develop software for a large enterprise company, chances are you haven&#8217;t. The software testing company with a focus on modern cloud and enterprise applications was founded in Austria in 2007 and grew from a small consulting firm to a major player in this field, with customers like Allianz, BMW, Starbucks, Deutsche Bank, Toyota and UBS. In 2017, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/23/insight-ventures-invests-165-million-in-automated-testing-startup-tricentis/">raised</a> a $165 million Series B round led by Insight Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Today, Tricentis announced that it has acquired <a href="https://www.neotys.com/">Neotys</a>, a popular performance testing service with a focus on modern enterprise applications and a tests-as-code philosophy. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition. France-based Neotys launched in 2005 and raised about €3 million before the acquisition. Today, it has about 600 customers for its NeoLoad platform. These include BNP Paribas, Dell, Lufthansa, McKesson and TechCrunch&#8217;s own corporate parent, Verizon.</p>
<p>As Tricentis CEO Sandeep Johri noted, testing tools were traditionally script-based, which also meant they were very fragile whenever an application changed. Early on, Tricentis introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricentis_Tosca">a low-code tool</a> that made the automation process both easier and resilient. Now, as even traditional enterprises move to DevOps and release code at a faster speed than ever before, testing is becoming both more important and harder for these companies to implement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You have to have automation and you cannot have it be fragile, where it breaks, because then you spend as much time fixing the automation as you do testing the software,&#8221; Johri said. &#8220;Our core differentiator was the fact that we were a low-code, model-based automation engine. That&#8217;s what allowed us to go from $6 million in recurring revenue eight years ago to $200 million this year.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qsOdnqCSyZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">3 new $100M ARR club members and a call for the next generation of growth-stage startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 new $100M ARR club members and a call for the next generation of growth-stage startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=qsOdnqCSyZ" data-secret="qsOdnqCSyZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tricentis, he added, wants to be the testing platform of choice for large enterprises. &#8220;We want to make sure we do everything that a customer would need, from a testing perspective, end to end. Automation, test management, test data, test case design,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Neotys allows the company to expand this portfolio by adding load and performance testing as well. It&#8217;s one thing to do the standard kind of functional testing that Tricentis already did before launching an update, but once an application goes into production, load and performance testing becomes critical as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you put it into production &#8212; or before you deploy it &#8212; you need to make sure that your application not only works as you expect it, you need to make sure that it can handle the workload and that it has acceptable performance,&#8221; Johri noted. &#8220;That&#8217;s where load and performance testing comes in and that&#8217;s why we acquired Neotys. We have some capability there, but that was primarily focused on the developers. But we needed something that would allow us to do end-to-end performance testing and load testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies already had an existing partnership and had integrated their tools before the acquisition &#8212; and many of its customers were already using both tools, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking forward to joining Tricentis, the industry leader in continuous testing,&#8221; said Thibaud Bussière, president and co-founder at Neotys. &#8220;Today’s Agile and DevOps teams are looking for ways to be more strategic and eliminate manual tasks and implement automated solutions to work more efficiently and effectively. As part of Tricentis, we’ll be able to eliminate laborious testing tasks to allow teams to focus on high-value analysis and performance engineering.&#8221;</p>
<p>NeoLoad will continue to exist as a stand-alone product, but users will likely see deeper integrations with Tricentis&#8217; existing tools over time, include <a href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/tricentis-analytics/130/en/content/tricentis_analytics/analytics_intro.htm">Tricentis Analytics</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Johri tells me that he considers Tricentis one of the &#8220;best kept secrets in Silicon Valley&#8221; because the company not only started out in Europe (even though its headquarters is now in Silicon Valley) but also because it hasn&#8217;t raised a lot of venture rounds over the years. But that&#8217;s very much in line with Johri&#8217;s philosophy of building a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of Silicon Valley tends to pay attention only when you raise money,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;I actually think every time you raise money, you&#8217;re diluting yourself and everybody else. So if you can succeed without raising too much money, that&#8217;s the best thing. We feel pretty good that we have been very capital efficient and now we&#8217;re recognized as a leader in the category &#8212; which is a huge category with $30 billion spend in the category. So we&#8217;re feeling pretty good about it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During every economic boom, there are startup investors who appear on the scene from new corners. Some churn out; others earn the respect of the old guard over time.</p>
<p>Jake Paul would be happy to be in the latter camp. Then again, the 24-year-old didn&#8217;t become a social media star by being conventional. Little wonder that Paul is now jumping into venture capital with an outfit that&#8217;s branded the <a href="https://angel.co/v/back/anti-fund">Anti Fund</a>. Newly formed with serial entrepreneur Geoffrey Woo, the endeavor is traditional in some ways but has a decidedly different point of view, say the two.</p>
<p>Some of the basics: Anti Fund is not a discrete pool of capital but is instead using AngelList&#8217;s Rolling Funds platform, which enables investors to raise money through a quarterly subscription from interested backers. Among those who&#8217;ve already committed capital are Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why choose a rolling fund instead of a traditional fund? For one thing, Paul and Woo were drawn to its Rule 506(c) structure, which allows issuers to broadly solicit an offering. Because Anti Fund plans to focus largely on consumer-focused opportunities and next-generation creator platforms in particular, it wants to be &#8220;able to promote and advertise our fund,&#8221; says Woo, who most recently founded a nutrition-based <a href="https://hvmn.com/">food and beverage company</a> and earlier in his career <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/11/groupon-acquires-realtime-location-aware-service-glassmap-to-help-you-find-deals/">sold a company</a> to Groupon.</p>
<p>Paul relatedly wants to ensure his fans can get involved if they like. &#8220;I have followers are different reasons, and they want to be involved in what I&#8217;m doing. If they&#8217;re involved in our fund, then that&#8217;s more people rooting for us and our portfolio companies to win. We almost create this army that&#8217;s pushing all of these companies forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for check sizes, Anti Fund plans to invest between $100,000 and $1 million in one to two startups every quarter. The goal, says Paul, is to be the &#8220;biggest rolling fund on AngelList,&#8221; investing &#8220;around $10 million to $20 million a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti Fund is just the newest effort to come from the world of social media influencers. As we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mrbeasts-management-company-night-media-has-a-new-venture-fund-thats-backed-by-creators/">earlier this month</a>, the management company of another YouTube star, MrBeast, has dived into the world of venture capital with a $20 million fund it assembled with commitments from social media creators. Dispo, a photo-sharing app cofounded by YouTube star David Dobrik also attracted <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html">widespread attention</a> and funding earlier this year.</p>
<p>A new startup called <a href="https://getjuice.com/">Creative Juice</a> just raised funding, too, to provide <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance">equity-based financing</a> to YouTube creators. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is among its investors. (It make a lot of sense, suggests Woo, who says that Anti Fund believes firmly that &#8220;individuals will become their own media channels.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/style/byte-vine-short-video-apps.html">10 years</a> into the influencer phenomenon, the trend isn&#8217;t surprising. &#8220;I think a lot of creators with newfound wealth &#8212; a lot of YouTubers or Instagram models &#8212; don&#8217;t necessarily know what to do with their money,&#8221; says Paul, who has already diversified into boxing, making his professional boxing debut last year. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to lead the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Paul nor Woo is new to startup investing. Woo has invested in roughly 20 startups on his own, including Paribus, an email widget that saved consumers money and that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/capital-one-acquires-online-price-tracker-paribus/">acquired</a> by Capital One. Paul, meanwhile, previously cofounded another small venture outfit called <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/investor/tgz-capital">TGZ Capital</a> that he says participated in the funding rounds of 15 startups.</p>
<p>One of these is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.getquip.com/">Quip</a>, a seven-year-old oral care company that has raised $62 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. Another company backed by Paul is <a href="https://www.triller.co/">Triller</a>, a social video app that briefly became the most-downloaded free app in the App Store <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreabossi/2020/08/03/triller-jumps-to-no-1-on-the-app-store-overtakes-tiktok-as-drama-continues/?sh=13bf86496d4a">last summer</a> when bigger rival TikTok was facing an uncertain future in the U.S.</p>
<p>Triller has since lost enough of that momentum that talk of going public via a special purpose acquisition vehicle has yet to lead to a tie-up, six months after the company reportedly began <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-triller-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-tiktok-rival-triller-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN26W0V5">exploring the possibility</a>. Still, as a stakeholder, Paul is keeping it in the headlines, including by providing it with exclusive rights to stream a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/jake-paul-vs-ben-askren-start-date-how-to-watch-online-press-conference-shenanigans">pay-per-view boxing match</a> between himself with former MMA wrestler Ben Asken on April 17.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it&#8217;s because Paul moved from L.A. to Miami to train for the fight that he met Woo, a Californian who visited Miami this past January for what was supposed to be a weekend trip and wound up staying. The two say they happened to hit it off at a tech event and, after establishing they had mutual friends, connected over their interest in performance nutrition, with Paul investing in Woo&#8217;s newest company, HVMN.</p>
<p>Last month, they decided to partner on Anti Fund, too.</p>
<p>Whether the two succeed as business partners will take time to learn. Certainly, they both have a strong work ethic. Woo has started three companies since graduating from Stanford with a computer science degree. Though Paul makes what seems an inordinate amount of money for creating YouTube videos, he has created thousands of them in order to amass his more than 20 million followers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also clear that, as with his social media career, Paul is taking boxing <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a30456685/jake-paul-pro-boxer-interview/">seriously</a>. During his most recent fight, in November, he <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-nate-robinson-fight-results-highlights-paul-scores-scary-knockout-in-second-round/live/">knocked out</a> former NBA player Nate Robinson in the second round. His first boxing match, against fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib in January of last year, also ended in a knockout just minutes into the fight.</p>
<p>Many professional athletes see the fights as mere stunts, given Paul&#8217;s famous made-for-video antics, from a short-lived <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jake-paul-admits-tana-mongeau-marriage-was-fake-gives-julia-rose-relationship-update-exclusive">marriage</a>, to <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/7/19/16001358/jake-paul-house-neighbors-youtube">disregarding</a> the concerns of neighbors in West Hollywood, to being charged by police last June for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/04/jake-paul-youtube-riot-looting/">criminal trespass and unlawful assembly</a> connected with the looting of an Arizona mall.</p>
<p>An obvious risk is that the best deal-makers in the world will see Anti Fund as a stunt, too, or else that something that Paul says or does will ruffle feathers. As industry watchers know, investors&#8217; excitement over Dobrik&#8217;s Dispo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">dissipated quickly</a> after Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">first detailed</a> various accusations of misconduct against members of the Dobrik&#8217;s online squad, including an accusation of rape that allegedly took place during a video shoot.</p>
<p>Paul, who finished high school online in order to pursue a career as an influencer, is well aware of the Dobrik scandal. It&#8217;s because he has grown up in plain view, in fact, that he&#8217;s not concerned about something from his past threatening his future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely [risky to be in my position]. Your life is put on display when you choose to be a celebrity and specifically a vlogger. But because I&#8217;ve lived online, everyone&#8217;s seen everything already,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He also thinks that &#8220;VCs and people in the business world understand more and more how to work&#8221; with influencers and other celebrities who have enormous followings and are bringing them along as their careers evolve. &#8220;At the end of the day,&#8221; he says of business dealings, &#8220;if someone is a good person and you have a relationship established with them, that&#8217;s what really matters.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thelivekindlyco.com/">LIVEKINDLY Collective</a>, the shouty parent company behind a family of plant-based food brands, has snagged cash from the global impact investing arm of $103 billion investment firm TPG to close its latest round of funding at $335 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fundraising shows that investors still have high hopes for plant-based food brands and that despite the money that&#8217;s flowed to companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods &#8212; and the resurgence of older brands in the category like Quorn or Kelloggs&#8217; Morningstar Farms &#8212; there&#8217;s still a healthy appetite among investors for more brands.</p>
<p>LIVEKINDLY was founded by some heavy hitters from the food industry, including Kees Kruythoff, the former president of Unilever North America; Roger Lienhard, the founder of Blue Horizon; and Jodi Monelle, the chief executive and founder of LIVEKINDLY Media. Food industry veterans like Mick Van Ettinger, a former Unilever employee, and Aldo Uva, a former Nestlé employee, round out the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded as a rollup for a number of different vegetarian and alternative protein food brands, the LIVEKINDLY Collective is now one of the largest plant-based food companies, by funding.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the money to expand into the U.S. and China and to power additional acquisitions, partnerships and investments in plant-based foods.</p>
<p>The company raised money previously from S2G Ventures and Rabo Corporate Investments, the investment arm of the giant Dutch financial services firm, Rabobank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the founding investors behind LIVEKINDLY believe that the technology has a long way to go before it matures. And it&#8217;s likely that this latest round will be LIVEKINDLY&#8217;s last before an initial public offering of its own. </span></p>

<p>“We are building a global pureplay in plant-based alternatives &#8212; which we believe is the future of food,” said Roger Lienhard, founder and executive chairman of Blue Horizon and founder of LIVEKINDLY Collective. “In just one year, we have raised a significant amount of capital, which testifies to the urgency of our mission and the enormous investment opportunity it represents. We believe the momentum behind plant-based living will continue to grow in both the private and public markets.”</p>
<p>As a result of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its investment, Steve Ellis, co-managing partner of The Rise Fund, has joined the LIVEKINDLY Collective board of directors, effective March 1, 2021.</span></p>
<p>“We are excited to work with LIVEKINDLY Collective and its ecosystem of innovative companies and world-class leaders to meet the growing global demand for healthy, plant-based, clean-label options,” said Ellis. “The company’s unique, mission-driven model operates across the entire value chain, from seed to fork, to drive worldwide adoption of plant-based alternatives and create a healthier planet for all.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, a Utah-based software company that provides corporate spend management software, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">a $165 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation</a>. It followed its competitor <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> to unicorn-status as the market for financial services software and corporate payment solutions stayed red-hot in 2021 after a blockbuster 2020.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, a competitor to both Divvy and Brex, is looking to raise new capital from Stripe and D1 Capital Partners at a valuation that could top $1 billion. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-invests-in-brex-rival-ramp-at-1-6-billion-valuation">first reported the news</a>, which TechCrunch confirmed with a source familiar with the transactions.</p>
<p>Ramp also competes with startups like <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> and <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a>, each providing software designed to help companies allow, administer and track corporate cash outflows. The startup category is perhaps best known for its concept of providing company cards to startups and other SMBs, though its market has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">matured into financial software designed</a> to provide a central node for internal expense controls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pace of investment into startup cohorts has been aggressive. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">raised $150 million</a> after the pandemic set in, while Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">raised several</a> times <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">last year</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">adding a debt facility earlier this year</a> to its financial backstop. Airbase also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">raised last year</a>, sharing growth metrics as 2020 came to a close. Teampay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">added $5 million</a> to its 2019-era Series A last year as well.</p>
<p>And in a sign that the model of fintech startups building corporate spend software could prove popular in other markets, a Latin American-focused startup in the space called <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">raised $3.5 million earlier this month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss automation and technology company ABB has <a href="https://new.abb.com/news/detail/76179/abb-and-amazon-web-services-steer-fleets-to-an-all-electric-future">announced a collaboration</a> with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a cloud-based EV fleet management platform that it hopes will hasten the electrification of fleets. The platform, which the company says will help operators maintain business continuity as they switch to electric, will roll out in the second half of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement comes after a wave of major delivery companies pledged to electrify their fleets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon already has a number of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian-sourced electric delivery vans on the streets of California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to have 10,000 more operational by this year; UPS ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival for its fleet; 20% of DHL’s fleet is already electric; and FedEx plans to electrify its entire fleet by 2040. A </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/charging-electric-vehicle-fleets-how-to-seize-the-emerging-opportunity#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted commercial and passenger fleets in the U.S. could include as many as eight million EVs by 2030, compared with fewer than 5,000 in 2018. That’s about 10-15% of all fleet vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make EV adoption easier and more scalable for fleets,” Frank Muehlon, president of ABB’s e-mobility division, told TechCrunch. “To power progress, the industry must bring together the best minds and adopt an entrepreneurial approach to product development.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABB brings to the table experience in e-mobility solutions, energy management and charging technology, which will combine with AWS’s cloud and software to make a single-view platform that can be tailored to whichever company is using it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies will be able to monitor things like charge planning, EV maintenance status and route optimization based on the time of day, weather and use patterns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon said they’ll work with customers to explore ways to use existing data from fleets for faster implementation.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=DkyssVdHU6" data-secret="DkyssVdHU6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The platform will be hosted on the AWS cloud, which means that it can scale anywhere AWS is available, which so far includes in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">25 regions globally</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform will be hardware-agnostic, meaning any type of EV or charger can work with it. Integration of software into specific EV fleets will depend on the fleet&#8217;s level of access to third-party asset management systems and onboard EV telematics, but the platform will support a layered feature approach, wherein each layer provides more accurate vehicle data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon says this makes for a more seamless interface than existing third-party charging management software, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have the technology or the flexibility to work with the total breadth of EV models and charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do fleet managers have to contend with the speed of development in charging technology, but they also need real-time vehicle and charging status information, access to charging infrastructures and information for hands-on maintenance,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon. &#8220;This new real-time EV fleet management solution will set new standards in the world of electric mobility for global fleet operators and help them realize improved operations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This software is aimed at depot and commercial fleets, as well as public infrastructure fleets. Muehlon declined to specify any specific EV operators or customers lined up to use this new technology, but he did say there are “several pilots underway” which will “enable us to ensure that we are developing market-ready solutions for all kinds of fleets.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oh hello. What’s this then? A Niantic-branded AR headset? Perhaps? John Hanke, CEO of the Pokémon GO developer teased what could be a first-party head-mounted wearable, as the company makes a more aggressive push into augmented reality.</p>
<p>“Exciting to see the progress we’re making to enable new kinds of devices that leverage our platform,” the executive noted in the text accompanying an image of eyeglasses temples sporting the Niantic name in bright orange.</p>
<p>Niantic has been a fairly active investor in the augmented reality hardware space, so there is also the possibility that they&#8217;ve done a branding partnership with a startup on a project, but this cryptic image crop is certainly making it look like they&#8217;re showcasing a device with first-party branding. There&#8217;s also the potential that this is a product in the &#8220;smart glasses&#8221; category that doesn&#8217;t include a display but focuses on building audio or camera functionality into a pair of glasses. Niantic has previously announced that they&#8217;ve been working with Qualcomm to help define their reference design for their XR hardware platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Niantic for additional comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting to see the progress we’re making to enable new kinds of devices that leverage our platform&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/yYglk4q89G">pic.twitter.com/yYglk4q89G</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Hanke (@johnhanke) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnhanke/status/1376624749787242499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Notably, the Twitter teaser also follows Niantic’s posting of a job listing for a Head of AR OS Engineering.</p>
<p>“We are on an ambitious mission to turn the world into an Augmented Reality canvas which games and other applications can paint on top of,” the listing states. “This future is fully realized on AR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Niantic’s Engineering Team is seeking an inspirational leader to oversee the engineering direction to help build an AR operating system for HMDs and enable applications for millions of Niantic players.”</p>

<p>The image arrives amid a recent flurry of activity for the one-time Google spin-out. Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/niantic-announces-partnership-with-nintendo-on-new-augmented-reality-pikmin-title/">the company announced an AR title based on Pikmin</a>, another Nintendo collaboration following its wildly successful Pokémon title. Earlier this month, it showed off a proof-of-concept version of Pokémon GO running on Microsoft’s HoloLens 2.</p>
<p>Niantic&#8217;s AR platform has stayed under wraps for the most part as the company seems to wait for a more active moment in augmented reality development to make a major push. Part of that activity may ultimately be defined by a broader AR hardware ecosystem, and as Apple and Facebook compete to release their own devices, I would imagine that there is some concern among players like Niantic that those early devices will focus on first-party software initially and leave fewer platform opportunities for third-parties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of companies have emerged over the last few years determined to reduce waste in the electric vehicle battery market. Chief among these is recycling firm Redwood Materials, which has quickly expanded since its launch in 2017 by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel to become the largest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America. Now the firm is teaming up with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra in a deal that may help boost the domestic battery supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the agreement, all Proterra batteries will be sent to Redwood’s facilities for recycling in Carson City, Nevada. The two companies entered the agreement in January, but have been in discussion since last summer, when Proterra reached out to learn more about Redwood’s recycling process. That led to a trip out to Redwood’s facilities in Nevada to see if the recycler could process Proterra battery packs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That went really well,” Proterra CTO Dustin Grace told TechCrunch. Grace worked for Straubel for around nine years at Tesla. “We were super excited to see their operation. From there, we started work on our master supply agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra has sent around 26,000 pounds of battery material to Nevada for recycling since entering the partnership, though this does not represent the pace of future deliveries. Overall, Redwood receives 60 tons per day, or 20,000 tons of batteries per year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The batteries that power Proterra’s fleets are designed to last the lifespan of the vehicle, but the company offers a battery leasing program that guarantees replacement after six years &#8212; which means plenty of useful life will remain in the battery, as much as 80-90% charging capacity. To exploit the remainder of this capacity, Proterra has plans to reuse the batteries in second-life applications &#8212; such as in stationary storage systems hooked up to Proterra charging hardware &#8212; before they head to Nevada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First the grading of the battery will occur at Proterra by our remanufacturing engineering team. If the battery is deemed ready for second-life, it will go into one of those applications; if it’s not, it gets recycled,” Grace said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only once all this useful life is exhausted will the batteries be sent to Redwood, where the waste will be reprocessed into valuable raw material. And with the transit EV market poised to reach 50% of all annual sales by 2025, there will be plenty of batteries that will need reprocessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just weeks after Redwood announced it was teaming up with e-bike manufacturer Specialized to recycle its batteries. Redwood already has arrangements to process scrap from Panasonic’s battery cell production at the Nevada Tesla Gigafactory, and with Amazon to recycle EV batteries and other waste. Through these business-to-business partnerships Redwood aims to develop a circular battery supply chain, supplying the raw materials back to the manufacturer. The company also accepts electronics and batteries</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-now-accepting-your-old-smartphones/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from everyday consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can be mailed to Redwood via a mailing address posted on its website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership is a sign that both companies are thinking large-scale and long-term. A spokesperson for Redwood said in a statement to TechCrunch that the recycler is focused on “developing the solution for a fully closed-loop recycling for EV batteries.” That means finding truly sustainable, long-term sources of materials like cobalt, lithium and copper to eventually move beyond terrestrial mining. And Straubel</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has been vocal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past about his ambition to grow Redwood into one of the world’s largest battery materials companies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more battery-grade raw materials become available in the United States, Proterra sees an opportunity to eventually expand into domestic battery-cell manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still early days but we’re trying to set ourselves up for the future state of this market at scale. That’s really the primary benefit of this partnership existing today,” Grace said. “The way we see it, domestic cell production for Proterra is a very, very important part of our roadmap here in the coming years. The idea of generating more battery-grade raw materials on North American soil directly supports the expansion of that battery manufacturing concept within the U.S. So I think this starting now absolutely aids our plans for domestic cell manufacturing in the near future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another proptech is considering raising capital through the public arena.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.knock.com">Knock</a> confirmed Monday that it is considering going public, although CEO Sean Black did not specify whether the company would do so via a traditional IPO, SPAC merger or direct listing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are considering all of our options,&#8221; Black told TechCrunch. &#8220;We pioneered the real estate transaction revolution over five years ago and our priority is to build a war chest to dramatically widen the already cavernous gap between us and any unoriginal knock-offs.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/property-tech-startup-knock-hires-goldman-sachs-to-go-public?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported earlier today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company had hired Goldman Sachs to advise on such a bid, which Knock also confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, Knock is potentially seeking to raise $400 million to $500 million through an IPO, according to “people familiar with the matter,” at a valuation of about $2 billion. The company declined to comment on valuation.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Knock COO Jamie Glenn are no strangers to the proptech game, having both been on the founding team of Trulia, which went public in 2012 and was acquired by Zillow for $3.5 billion in 2014. The pair started Knock in 2015, and have since raised over $430 million in venture funding and another $170 million or so in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock started out as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> real estate brokerage business until last July, when the company announced a major shift in strategy and said it was becoming a lender. At the time, Knock unveiled its Home Swap program, under which Knock serves as the lender to help a homeowner buy a new home before selling their old house. It previously worked with lending partners but has now become a licensed lender itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the company now offers integrated financing &#8212; the mortgage and an interest-free bridge loan &#8212; with the goal of helping consumers make strong non-contingent offers on a new home before repairing and listing their old home for sale on the open market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that move, Knock eliminated its Home Trade-In program, where it helped consumers buy before selling by using its own money to purchase the new home on behalf of the consumer before prepping and listing the consumer’s old house on the open market. Under that trade-in model, the homeowner used the proceeds from selling their old home to buy the new home from Knock and pay the company back for any repairs it did to prep the house for sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Black told me that Knock had decided to move away from its trade-in program in part because it was capital-intensive and required the closing of a house to take place twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It added friction to the experience,” he said. “And now, especially during COVID, it can be inconvenient to try and sell a house at the same time as buying one. This is about making something possible that isn’t possible with any other traditional lender. We’re able to lend some money before an owner’s [old] house is even listed on the market.” </span></p>
<p>To sum up what Knock does today, Black said the company aims to offer a full service technology platform that includes everything &#8220;from pre-funding the homebuyers to make non-contingent offers and win bidding wars, to getting their old home ready for market with our contractor network to selling their old home quickly at the highest price and empowers them to have their own agent working with them in the app through the entire process.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demand for the Home Swap, he added, has &#8220;exceeded all expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock is headquartered in New York and San Francisco. The company launched the Home Swap in three markets in July 2020, and today it is in 27 markets in nine states, including Texas, California and North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our original plan was to be in 21 markets by the end of 2021,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;At our current growth rate, we expect to end the year at 45 markets and be in 100 by 2023.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Knock began 2021 with 100 employees and now has 150. Its plan is to have at least 400 employees by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other proptech startups that have recently announced plans to go public include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/proptech-startup-states-title-now-doma-going-public-via-spac-in-3b-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (formerly States Title).</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities traditionally have been bustling hubs where people live, work and play. When the pandemic hit, some people fled major metropolitan markets for smaller towns — raising questions about the future validity of cities. It’s true that we’re still months away from broader reopenings and herd immunity via current vaccination efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those who predicted that COVID-19 would destroy major urban communities might want to stop shorting the resilience of these municipalities and start going long on what the post-pandemic future looks like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.N. </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/40b530ac84ab4931874e1f7efb4f1a22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s population will reside in cities, communities that are the epicenters of culture, innovation, wealth, education and tourism, to mention just a few benefits. They are not only worth saving — they’re also ripe for rebirth, precisely why many municipal leaders in the U.S. anticipate the Biden administration will allocate substantial monetary resources to rebuilding legacy infrastructure (and doing so in a way that prioritizes equitable access). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this emphasis on inclusivity and social innovation, the tech community has the ability to address a range of lifestyle and well-being issues: infrastructure, transportation and mobility, law enforcement, environmental monitoring and energy allocation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this time of reset for cities, what smart city technologies will transform how we live our lives? What kinds of technology will make the biggest impact on cities in the next 12 months? Which smart cities are ahead of the curve? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To unpack these questions and more, we conducted the SmartCityX Survey of industry experts — including smart city investors, corporate and municipal thought leaders, members of academia and startups on the front lines of urban innovation — to help provide valuable insights into where we’re heading. Below you’ll find some key takeaways:</span></p>
<h2><b>Infrastructure is the most crucial issue for cities</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical infrastructure topped the list of most prominent issues facing today’s cities, followed closely by traffic and transportation. Cisco may have </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-turns-off-lights-on-smart-city-push-11609178895"><span style="font-weight: 400;">left the party too soon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but others, including countless startups, are lining up and capitalizing on future growth opportunities in the space. A couple of recent data points that support this trend — particularly as it relates to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure rebuilding, IoT and open toolkits to connect fragmented technologies — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">include the following:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley Systems, fresh off a September IPO, </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/bentley-systems-touchdown-ventures-set-up-100m-corporate-venture-capital-fund-61222293"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a $100 million corporate venture capital fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2020/12/09/qualcomm-announces-qualcomm-iot-services-suite-aimed-enable-digital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualcomm announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its IoT Services Suite, comprising leading solutions ranging from wireless connectivity, hardware, software and data analytics to platform integration.   </span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Infrastructure is paramount to Smart City success. It&#8217;s crucial that this infrastructure be &#8220;architected&#8221; as opposed to just connected. This is the only way to truly achieve seamless interoperability while ensuring scalability, reliability, security and privacy. Technology companies that offer robust architectural components and/or platforms stand to deliver tremendous stakeholder value and outsized returns to investors.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sue Stash, general partner, Pandemic Impact Fund</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>What’s driving change in cities?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what will accelerate innovation and change in cities, an overwhelming majority cited COVID-19 as the primary factor, followed by remote work, which has accelerated the adoption of online collaboration tools and forced legacy companies to complete multiyear digital transformation projects in a matter of months. The biggest opportunity is to build cities back better and smarter, focusing on new infrastructures that do more with less, and for most of us, that begins and ends at home.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are trending hotter than pogs right now, and the number of articles published on the subject in the last few weeks has ballooned into the thousands. So a pardon must be begged at the outset here, but the overlooked potential of token economies is simply too important to let slip away.</p>
<p>NFTs are but one small <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">part of a much larger development</a> in the world of finance capital. What leaves some scratching their heads and chuckling could, within a decade, completely transform the model of investment that has been in place since the rise of Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2>Non-fungible what?</h2>
<p>NFTs have had a strange first step into the spotlight, bringing wealth to a very small group of people and making most people simply perplexed. Before NFTs are written off as a flash in the pan, it might be worth considering that NFTs were never designed to be very useful in traditional investment frameworks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>An auction house selling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/daily-crunch-nft-artwork-sells-for-69m/">$69 million JPEG</a> is akin to a horse-and-buggy driver strapping a small nuclear reactor to the top of the cab and declaring, “This is an <em>atomic </em>buggy!” as the horse continues to chug along, doing all the work. You’ll get the attention of bystanders, but nothing has fundamentally changed here.</p>
<p>Each of the headline-grabbing NFT sales seen recently are instances of exactly this kind of backward thinking. And the bystanders criticizing the buggy driver and saying, “nuclear reactors are hype,” are not really seeing the long-term implications, or they just don’t like horses.</p>
<h2>Whales, dogs and unicorns</h2>
<p>From early conceptions of investment as a way to fund transoceanic ship voyages, to the rise of venture capital as we know it today, the entire cosmos of finance capital has remained an elite sport. This is because the current model is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">big investors getting big wins</a>.</p>
<p>Almost the entire world of finance capital is structured on big whales and unicorns, mythical creatures that mere mortals consider themselves lucky to have glimpsed. The word “structured” is chosen here carefully, as the “big-dog” theory of capital is literally built on powerful intermediaries that facilitate the will of these top investors.</p>
<p>The invention of bitcoin is an epochal event in the development of finance. Bitcoin itself has crystallized into merely another playground of power, but the technological tremors it left in its wake are starting to emerge as the real game-changers. Primarily, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) &#8212; of which blockchain is but one instance &#8212; are a breakthrough on par with being able to send a message instantaneously to a person on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>DLTs mean that finance capital no longer has a need for powerful intermediaries &#8212; or intermediaries of any kind. Middlemen are currently very necessary in order for parties to establish trust in transactions, trades contracts or investments. Paying for the services of these middlemen can be written off as the cost of doing business for large companies and wealthy individuals, but these expenses remain prohibitive barriers for many.</p>
<p>DLTs break down these barriers because trust is established by and built into the very architecture of the network itself. With DLTs, anybody with an internet connection can do big-dog-style business deals at whatever level they can afford, and the way that these deals are transacted is through tokens.</p>
<h2>Token economies will be transformative</h2>
<p>DLT economies are going to be adopted by all of the major investment players in the next few years as the advantages of decentralizing investment are too numerous to ignore &#8212; lower friction for transactions due to automation, much quicker (real-time) results and analysis of market conditions, greater security through transparency, and a higher level of customization for financial products and services. The adoption of decentralized finance by major players will have a net-positive impact for everyone else.</p>
<p>Tokens are the lifeblood of this new system, and non-fungible tokens are just one type of token. In this emerging model, there are payment tokens that behave like money, security tokens that are comparable to stocks, utility tokens that provide functions like space or bandwidth and hybrid tokens that mix these tokens into new forms. If it sounds a bit confusing and exciting, that’s because it is.</p>
<p>The main takeaway to understand here is that tokens are going to replace not just stocks and other investment products but also the entire idea of having middlemen between you and your purchases, whether that middleman is an investment broker, a credit card company, a platform provider or a bank. The decentralized economy is going to be a much more open and direct kind of market.</p>
<h2>The rubber hits the road like this</h2>
<p>It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model. These protrusions are most apparent where economic reality doesn’t really make sense.</p>
<p>Think of the emerging gig economy, where nobody really seems to have a steady job anymore, where each of us is some kind of professional mercenary, moving from gig to gig. Think of the huge number of subscriptions that most of us carry like millstones around our necks. Think of the paradoxically frustrating relationship of musicians to streaming platforms, or artists to galleries. Think about the amount of crushing poverty that still remains on our planet.</p>
<p>These are all instances of models of living and working not really fitting into old containers. We can all sense that these aspects of our lives aren’t really functioning optimally, but we can’t quite say why and we certainly don’t know what the solution might look like. Decentralized, tokenized economies have the potential to erase all of these pain points, paradoxes and kludges and replace them with something much more intuitive and elegant.</p>
<p>This new reality is easy to imagine in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/why-the-next-cryptokitties-mania-wont-be-about-collectables/">some of its attributes</a>: Instead of nine different subscriptions, you can just pay directly for the content that you want, when you want it. Instead of artists giving up half of their earnings to galleries or musicians giving, well, all of their earnings to streaming platforms, they now just take direct payment for their work through fluid networks built by and for this type of content. Instead of paying brokers to facilitate your investments, you can now just invest directly in the enterprises that interest you, including formerly out-of-reach sectors like real estate investment. Instead of crushing poverty and fiercely protected borders between classes, we break down barriers and give everyone access to value.</p>
<p>Many of the other developments in a token economy have yet to be imagined, and this is probably the most exciting aspect of all. When we distribute the economy globally, in a way that allows anyone with an internet connection the ability to interact and contribute in a meaningful way, we are unlocking the value of untapped assets that are worth literally trillions of dollars. So what is holding us back, and how do we get there as soon as possible?</p>
<h2>The work ahead is very clear</h2>
<p>The hardest part of unlocking this new economy has already been achieved &#8212; we have the technological understanding of how to distribute and decentralize a system of consensus that combines with a system of digitizing assets for trade and investment.</p>
<p>The remaining work that will actually bring this system online is fairly obvious &#8212; first and foremost, we need to take a look at the ecological impacts that this new system has had in its infancy. We should absolutely outlaw mining farms or set the strictest limits for how much of their energy comes from nonrenewables. If the backbone of this new economy is destroying the planet, we need to shut it down before it grows, full stop. The system needs to be ecologically sustainable.</p>
<p>The second most immediate concern is that there are currently no standards, no common network, that the multitude of different cryptocurrencies and tokens agree on. It’s astounding and absolutely frustrating that the various cryptos are hardly even talking about this.</p>
<p>It’s as if we have a bunch of different companies not only inventing the light bulb but also inventing their own light sockets and wiring protocols, and each one is insisting that they are the best and they will win out in the end. Light bulbs are great, but can we please agree on one socket? This beautiful new economy will never get off the ground unless we build a neutral, interoperable network, and this network needs to be feeless and scalable.</p>
<p>The last cause of immediate concern is regulation and legal frameworks. There are too many people still in crypto that have some kind of anarchist’s deathwish to just be completely left outside, and this is not serving the long-term goals of our communities.</p>
<p>I’m all for knocking intermediaries out of the value chain, but this doesn’t automatically entail the establishment of a never-never land that no regulatory agencies are invited to. Legal frameworks for decentralized economies go hand in hand with our ethos of open-source, community-building, transparent operations. We all need to be advocates for thorough and precise regulation of our nascent technology.</p>
<p>With ecology, interoperability and regulation as our watchwords, we can begin work on building the actual apps and other infrastructure that will allow users to leverage the power of a new economy. The uses are limitless, from selling excess electricity to your regional smart power grid, to investing in your favorite artists’ network, to accepting direct payment for your own labor, to &#8212; yes &#8212; buying NFTs, which will make a lot more sense in the new economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The non-fungible token (NFT) mania</a> has inspired Ethereum fans to spend more than <a href="https://www.duneanalytics.com/rchen8/opensea">$224 million</a> on crypto collectibles so far in 2021 through marketplaces OpenSea and Rarible, but many buyers may not understand what they actually own.</p>
<p>“An NFT is not that different from any other crypto purchase in that you are buying control over information in an entry in a ledger,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, one of the founders of <a href="https://smoroslaw.com/">Smolinski Rosario Law</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

<p>NFT buyers don’t actually own the media files associated with their blockchain receipts, whether those files are JPEGs or GIFS or MP3s. The best way to know which aspects of the NFT craze will outlast this trendy boom is to look at the history of comparable assets. As it turns out, people have been making crypto collectibles for nearly seven years.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio">Zebedee </a>co-founder Christian Moss, who has been working on blockchain-based games since 2014, said he stopped making Bitcoin-based collectibles because transaction fees shot up. To make matters worse, some buyers viewed tokens as investments instead of as toys.</p>
<p>“They were tokens on Bitcoin,” Moss said. “A lot of developers ended up trying to pump their tokens and prices. … It felt like people who played those games felt like they were investors on the board. I don’t want my game to be an investment vehicle. Then players might try to sue me if they lost their tokens. It changed the dynamic of the game.”</p>
<p>These days, Moss helps people earn small amounts of bitcoin by playing mainstream video games like <a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio/status/1371136734965215232">Counter-Strike</a>. That way, there’s no confusion about how to value virtual assets; cryptocurrency is money and in-game assets are toys.</p>
<p>“NFTs aren’t game items at all; they are receipts,” Moss said. “If you have the receipt, you might be able to get an item in a game, but they can’t allow a Zelda sword NFT [in Counter-Strike], for example, because that might be copyright infringement. There are legal implications there.”</p>
<p>Indeed, legal implications are the crux of the NFT trend. Whether a court would protect the receipt-holder&#8217;s ownership over a given file depends on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s great if the artist intends to transfer any copyright for a work of art to an NFT purchaser, but can that be perfected to the point where a court of law or copyright office would recognize that transfer? That gets into additional questions of jurisdiction,&#8221; Rosario said. “Brands and platforms need to make sure they have the right agreements in place to govern these relationships.”</p>
<p>With regard to NFT sellers who take screenshots of other people’s content and profit from a corresponding NFT, Rosario said it’s hard to say whether that violates any laws.</p>
<p>“You probably start by looking at Twitter’s terms of service and begin the investigation there. It really depends,” he said, adding that impersonation or stealing someone’s passwords are different issues entirely.</p>
<p>And there are still open questions beyond copyright issues and fraud, such as <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cryptocurrency-and-ofac-beware-of-the-34002/">sanctions</a> and porn regulations.</p>
<h2><b>Finding a space for adult content</b></h2>
<p>A growing number of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/">adult content creators</a> are selling erotic NFTs on platforms like Rarible, often earning <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aella">hundreds of dollars</a> per photo. One such artist, <a href="https://rarible.com/polyannie">PolyAnnie</a>, said she has earned more from selling NFTs on Rarible alone than her average annual earnings <a href="https://allmylinks.com/polyannie01">across platforms</a> like OnlyFans, Patreon and ManyVids combined.</p>
<p>“I sold 90 NFTs, bringing in 10.11 ETH in five months,” she said. “I purchased 18 NFTs from other creators, too.”</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/french-parliament-passes-porn-age-verification-legislation/">age-verification requirements</a> for platforms with adult content, while other jurisdictions make platforms <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/2020/04/08/the-lessons-of-fosta-sesta-from-a-former-content-moderator/">potentially liable</a> for child porn or revenge porn if the platforms don’t heavily moderate explicit content. As such, platform providers tend to be conservative about their terms of service.</p>
<p>“A lot of these NFT platforms don’t want to deal with the risks of sexually oriented content,” PolyAnnie said.</p>
<p>That’s why some <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/42525">sex workers</a> have had their content <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:42525">censored </a>by platforms like Rarible. As for the most popular NFT platform, OpenSea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">which raised a Series A round from a16z earlier this month</a>, CEO Devin Finzer said his team moderates the platform and limits search results for adult content, so those NFTs can only be found by someone going directly to the creator’s profile.</p>
<p>“We haven’t exactly nailed it down, but one option is a separate section of our site for that type of content,” Finzer said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coming wave of electric vehicles will require more than thousands of charging stations. In addition to being installed, they also need to work — and today, that isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>If a station doesn&#8217;t send out an error or a driver doesn&#8217;t report it, network providers might never know there&#8217;s even a problem. Kameale C. Terry, who co-founded <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com">ChargerHelp!</a>, an on-demand repair app for electric vehicle charging stations, has seen these issues firsthand.</p>
<p>One customer assumed that poor usage rates at a particular station was due to a lack of EVs in the area, Terry recalled in a recent interview. That wasn&#8217;t the problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There was an abandoned vehicle parked there and the station was surrounded by mud,&#8221; said Terry who is CEO and co-founded the company with Evette Ellis.</p>
<p>Demand for ChargerHelp&#8217;s service has attracted customers and investors. The company said it has raised $2.75 million from investors Trucks VC, Kapor Capital, JFF, Energy Impact Partners and The Fund. This round values the startup, which was founded in January 2020, at $11 million post-money.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build out its platform, hire beyond its 27-person workforce and expand its service area. ChargerHelp works directly with the charging manufacturers and network providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today when a station goes down there&#8217;s really no troubleshooting guidance,&#8221; said Terry, noting that it takes getting someone out into the field to run diagnostics on the station to understand the specific problem. After an onsite visit, a technician then typically shares data with the customer, and then steps are taken to order the correct and specific part — a practice that often doesn&#8217;t happen today.</p>
<p>While ChargerHelp is couched as an on-demand repair app, it is also acts as a preventative maintenance service for its customers.</p>
<h2>Powering up</h2>
<p>The idea for ChargerHelp came from Terry&#8217;s experience working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles, including head of customer experience and director of programs. During her time there, she worked with 12 manufacturers, which gave her knowledge into inner workings and common problems with the chargers.</p>
<p>It was here that she spotted a gap in the EV charging market.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the stations went down we really couldn&#8217;t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,&#8221; Terry said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=YvX6vjL7uC" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And yet, the general practice was to use electrical contractors to fix issues at the charging stations. Terry said it could take as long as 30 days to get an electrical contractor on site to repair these non-electrical problems.</p>
<p>Terry often took matters in her own hands if issues arose with stations located in Los Angeles, where she is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was a part that needed to be swapped out, I would just go do it myself,&#8221; Terry said, adding she didn&#8217;t have a background in software or repairs. &#8220;I thought, if I can figure this stuff out, then anyone can.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January 2020, Terry quit her job and started ChargerHelp. The newly minted founder joined the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/los-angeles-cleantech-incubator-reboots-its-incubation-program-with-16-member-cohort/"> Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator</a>, where she developed a curriculum to teach people how to repair EV chargers. It was here that she met Ellis, a career coach at LACI who also worked at the Long Beach Job Corp Center. Ellis is now the chief workforce officer at ChargerHelp.</p>
<p>Since then, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://elementalexcelerator.com/">startup incubator</a>, raised about $400,000 in grant money, launched a pilot program with Tellus Power focused on preventative maintenance and landed contracts with EV charging networks and manufacturers such as EV Connect, ABB and SparkCharge. Terry said they have also hired their core team of seven employees and trained their first tranche of technicians.</p>

<p>ChargerHelp takes a workforce-development approach to finding employees. The company only hires in cohorts, or groups, of employees.</p>
<p>The company received more than 1,600 applications in its first recruitment round for electric vehicle service technicians, according to Terry. Of those, 20 were picked to go through training and 18 were ultimately hired to service contracts across six states, including California, Oregon, Washington, New York and Texas. Everyone picked to go through training is paid a stipend and earn two safety licenses.</p>
<p>The startup will begin its second recruitment round in April. All workers are full-time with a guaranteed wage of $30 an hour and are being given shares in the startup, Terry said. The company is working directly with workforce development centers in the areas where ChargerHelp needs technicians.</p>
