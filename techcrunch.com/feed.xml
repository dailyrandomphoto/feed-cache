										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Health and wellness apps startup <a href="https://palta.com/">Palta</a>, has raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Per Brillioth at VNV Global, with the participation of Target Global and other existing and new investors. The cash will be used to generate more products, such its existing products Flo.Health, Simple Fasting, Zing Fitness Coach, and others.</p>
<p>Palta claims to have 2.4M active paid subscribers in their apps.</p>
<p>Yuri Gurski, CEO and founder of Palta said: “Palta Brain platform, the foundational powerhouse that drives our consumer digital apps, allows for much faster scaling of both products that we envisage internally, as well as those that come to us from the market.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Mobile and preventative health services are the future of the health industry,” said Per Brillioth, CEO of VNV Global. “As a result, Palta has proven its capabilities to develop and scale its wide range of leading mobile subscription products.”</p>
<p>Headquartered in London with offices in Munich, Vilnius, Warsaw, and other locations, the company says most of its revenue comes from customers in the US (60%) and Western Europe (20%).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, August 2, 2021. What a day. Square kicked off this week’s news cycle with a megadeal, Google popped up with new hardware, and there are new VC funds aplenty. It’s busy, but before we get started, there’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/hear-startup-alley-companies-pitch-expert-vc-judges-on-the-next-episode-of-extra-crunch-live/">special summer edition of Extra Crunch Live this week that’s 100% pitch-off</a>. It’s on Wednesday, so be there or be square. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-is-building-its-own-chip-for-the-pixel-6/"><strong>Google pursues custom silicon:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Alphabet’s Google subsidiary is getting into the custom silicon game, TechCrunch reports. Akin to what Apple did with its A and M chips, Google hopes that its Tensor SoC (system on a chip) “will differentiate itself in a crowded smartphone field,” Brian Heater writes. For more on Google’s new hardware, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">head here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/"><strong>Square buys Afterpay:</strong></a> U.S. fintech giant Square is buying the Australian buy now, pay later company Afterpay for $29 billion in stock. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">dug into the deal’s numbers</a>, but the gist is that Afterpay brings merchants, global users and a new fintech product to Square. The deal isn’t cheap, but it does make sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/"><strong>Cloud infra spend accelerates:</strong></a> Want to know why investors are so hot and bothered by the tech industry these days? In part because demand just keeps accelerating. TechCrunch covered new data today indicating that the cloud infra market &#8212; which underpins so very many services that consumers and corporates depend on alike &#8212; saw spending grow 39% in Q2 2021 compared to the year-ago quarter. The total for the second quarter? $42 billion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-sold-to-new-media-firm-from-former-disney-execs/"><strong>Reese Witherspoon’s media company sells for $900M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This is not our usual startup fare, but when a media company sells for nearly $1 billion, we have to pay attention. Per TechCrunch, the company, Hello Sunshine, made content for major streaming firms. What’s weird is who bought it. A “yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs,” TechCrunch writes. Mysterious.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/"><strong>Afterpay investor bullish on Afterpay:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch published an op-ed by Dana Stalder, an investor at Matrix Partners and self-described “only institutional venture investor” in Afterpay. Their take? That Square + Afterpay will be greater as a sum than the mere addition of their parts. We’ll see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>Nektar.ai wants to consolidate B2B sales data:</strong></a> Selling software is no easy game, and there are myriad tools that every SDR and AE is expected to use. Nektar wants to be the central collection point <em>and</em> brain for all that data, and it just raised $6 million to grow its operation. Frankly, the salesops market is big, and I am surprised we don’t hear about even more companies pursuing similar lines of work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/yaydoo-secures-20m-aims-to-simplify-b2b-collections-payments/"><strong>Investors back startups making B2B payments simpler:</strong></a> Sticking to the B2B world, Yadoo has raised a $20 million round to power business-to-business payments. In short, while Venmoing your friend beer money is as easy as drinking said beer, it’s not the same with corporations. Yadoo is one of the startups looking to take the problem on, in this case from the startup’s Mexico City HQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, some venture capital news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/element-ventures-pulls-in-130m-to-double-down-on-the-fintech-enterprise-trend/"><strong>Element Ventures raises $130M:</strong></a> It’s a sign of the times that I am not at all surprised that a B2B-focused fintech venture capital firm just raised nine figures. Of <em>course</em> that’s a big enough problem space to deploy that amount of capital. And of <em>course</em> there are enough startups that fit its parameters to fill its book with deals. Element will invest in 15 companies each year, focusing on deals in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>More money for</strong><strong> LatAm:</strong></a> Newtopia is a new fund focused on Latin America that just put together a fresh $50 million fund. It will invest in pre-seed companies ($100,000 checks) and larger rounds ($250,000 to $1 million) in startups scaling toward their Series A. Early-stage investing is its own beast, so it’s nice that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the burgeoning Latin American market</a> is getting its own dedicated vehicles to tackle the task.</li>
<li>From the podcast today, if you are into edtech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-tale-of-two-edtech-ipos/">boy do we have the show for you</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand Curve: Questions you need to answer in your paid search ads</h2>
<p>At some point, almost every early-stage startup will use paid search ads to connect with customers and throw down the gauntlet with their competitors.</p>
<p>Most of these initial attempts at paid search are unsuccessful. There&#8217;s a steep learning curve when it comes to transforming passive searchers into paying customers, and almost no one gets it right the first time.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive guest post, growth marketing expert Stewart Hillhouse identified &#8220;14 questions your paid search should answer to ensure you&#8217;re only paying for the highest-intent shoppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question 1? “What’s in it for <strong>me</strong>?”</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/zoom-reaches-85m-settlement-in-zoombombing-lawsuit/"><strong>Zoombombing costs Zoom $85M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s immaterial technology fine comes via Zoom, the video product that became ubiquitous during the pandemic. It was sued by users claiming that it was “violating users’ privacy by sharing their data with third parties without permission and enabling ‘Zoombombing’ incidents,” per TechCrunch. The settlement is worth a total of 0.07% of the company’s $112 billion market cap. Oh no.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><strong>Amazon will pay you $10 for your palm print:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of sums of money so small that they should not induce any sort of behavioral changes, Amazon wants to give people $10 in credit if they give the company their palm print so that they can better check out at the e-commerce giant’s physical stores. Hard pass on this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/"><strong>Salesforce buys Mulesoft an RPA firm:</strong></a> CRM giant Salesforce is investing in Mulesoft, a company that it bought a ways back, in the form of German RPA company Servicetrace. Servicetrace will link up with Mulesoft, not Salesforce proper.</li>
<li><strong>I asked TechCrunch reporter and genial human </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller"><strong>Ron Miller</strong></a><strong> why the deal matters</strong>. He said that the deal, “while not on par with the Slack megadeal, is probably the kind of smaller deals the company will make in the next year.” He explained that the Servicetrace acquisition gives SFDC an “entry into the growing RPA market without spending a ton of money.” Ron’s also bullish on the planned Mulesoft integration.</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of the big reasons you’re giving 110% of your talent and effort to your private company is because you’re hoping to eventually cash in on all those vested incentive stock options (ISOs) that have been sitting in some account, waiting for the day your company goes public.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that. Who doesn’t dream of reaping an options windfall and using it to retire early, buy a house, pay off their college loans, travel around the world or become a full-time philanthropist?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to figuring out how to cash in their stock awards, most employees are on their own.</p>
<p>Their employers can’t always provide the answers they need &#8212; especially when the questions relate to personal finances. Most companies admit they need to be better at explaining how ISOs work in general, but they can’t legally work one-on-one with employees to help them exercise and sell shares the right way.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s why, when the time is right, many employees actively look for help from a qualified fiduciary financial adviser who can walk these could-be “options millionaires” through various cash-in scenarios.</p>
<p>Here’s a real-life example (using a pseudonym).</p>
<p>Kurt is a 50-year-old VP of product management at a healthcare startup that just went public. Over his three years with the company, Kurt had amassed 350,000 ISOs worth approximately $6 million. Unlike many options millionaires, he didn’t intend to cash in everything and retire early. He planned to stay with the firm but wanted to liquidate enough ISOs to pay for a vacation home and add greater diversification to his investment portfolio. This presented significant tax risks that Kurt wasn&#8217;t aware of.</p>
<p>If Kurt exercised his ISOs and sold the shares before a year had passed, his profits would be characterized as short-term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
<p>To illustrate the potential tax implications of this action, we created a hypothetical scenario that showed if Kurt exercised all of his ISOs and sold the shares immediately, he would incur approximately $6 million in ordinary income, which would push him into the top tax bracket and put him on the hook for almost $3 million in combined federal and state taxes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter">announced</a> today it&#8217;s partnering with news organizations The Associated Press (AP) and Reuters to expand its efforts focused on highlighting reliable news and information on its platform. Through the new agreements, Twitter&#8217;s Curation team will be able to leverage the expertise of the partnered organizations to add more context to the news and trends that circulate across Twitter, as well as aid with the company&#8217;s use of public service announcements during high-visibility events, misinformation labels and more.</p>
<p>Currently, the Curation team works to add additional information to content that includes Top Trends and other news on Twitter&#8217;s Explore tab. The team is also involved with how certain search results are ranked, to ensure that content from high-quality searches appear at the top of search results when certain keywords or hashtags are searched for on Twitter.</p>
<p>The team may also be involved with the prompts that appear in the Explore tab on the Home Timeline related to major events, like public health emergencies (such as the pandemic) or other events, like elections. And they may help with the misinformation labels that appear on tweets that are allowed to remain visible on Twitter, but are labeled with informative context from authoritative sources. These include tweets that violate Twitter&#8217;s rules around <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/manipulated-media">manipulated media</a>, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/election-integrity-policy">election integrity</a>, or <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy">COVID-19</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the team operates separately from Twitter&#8217;s Trust and Safety team, which determines when tweets violate Twitter&#8217;s guidelines and punitive action, like removal or bans, must be taken, Twitter confirmed that neither the AP nor Reuters will be involved in those sorts of enforcement decisions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184793" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2184793 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png 3308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MisleadingInfo.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>By working more directly with AP and Reuters, who also partner with Facebook on fact checks, Twitter says it will be able to increase the speed and scale to which it&#8217;s able to add this additional information to tweets and elsewhere on its platform. In particular, that means in times where news is breaking and when facts are in dispute as a story emerges, Twitter&#8217;s own team will be able to quickly turn to these more trusted sources to improve how contextual information is added to the conversations taking place on Twitter.</p>
<p>This could also be useful in stopping misinformation from going viral, instead of waiting until after the fact to correct misleading tweets.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s new crowdsourced fact-checking system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Birdwatch</a> will also leverage feedback from AP and Reuters to help determine the quality of information shared by Birdwatch participants.</p>
<p>The work will see the Curation team working with the news organizations not just to add context to stories and conversations, but also to help identify which stories need context added, Twitter told us. This added context could appear in many different places on Twitter, including on tweets, search, in Explore, and in curated selections, called Twitter Moments.</p>
<p>Twitter has often struggled with handling misinformation on its platform due its real-time nature and use by high-profile figures, who attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/">manipulate the truth</a> for their own ends. To date, it has experimented with many features to slow or stop the spread of misinformation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">disabling one-click retweets</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/twitter-5g-coronavirus-labels/">adding</a> fact checks, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/twitter-bans-james-okeefe-of-project-veritas-over-fake-account-policy/">banning</a> accounts, and more. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch is the latest effort</a> to add context to tweets, but the system is a decentralized attempt at handling misinformation &#8212; not one that relies on trusted partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;AP has a long history of working closely with Twitter, along with other platforms, to expand the reach of factual journalism,&#8221; noted Tom Januszewski, vice president of Global Business Development at AP, in a statement about the new agreement. &#8220;This work is core to our mission. We are particularly excited about leveraging AP’s scale and speed to add context to online conversations, which can benefit from easy access to the facts,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust, accuracy and impartiality are at the heart of what Reuters does every day, providing billions of people with the information they need to make smart decisions,&#8221; added Hazel Baker, the head of UGC Newsgathering at Reuters. &#8220;Those values also drive our commitment to stopping the spread of misinformation. We&#8217;re excited to partner with Twitter to leverage our deep global and local expertise to serve the public conversation with reliable information,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>Initially, the collaborations will focus on English-language content on Twitter, but the company says it expects the work to grow over time to support more languages and timezones. We&#8217;re told that, during this initial phase, Twitter will evaluate new opportunities to onboard collaborators that can support additional languages.</p>

<p>If you’re trying to develop fluency in a non-native tongue, language immersion is a crucial part of the learning process. Surrounding yourself with native speakers helps with pronunciation, context building, and most of all, confidence.</p>
<p>But what if you’re an eight-year-old kid in Spain learning English and can’t swing a solo trip to the United States for the summer?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Novakid, founded by Maxim Azarov, wants to be your next best option. The San Francisco-based edtech startup offers virtual-only, English language immersion for kids between the ages of four through 12, by combining a mix of different services from live tutors to gamification.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/">After closing its $4.25 million Series A</a> round last December, Novakid announced today that it is back with a $35 million Series B financing, led by Owl Ventures and Goodwater Capital. Existing investors also participated in the round, including PortfoLion, LearnStart, TMT Investments, Xploration Capital, LETA Capital and BonAngels.</p>
<p>The startup is raising capital in response to an active start to its year. The company’s active client base grew 350% year over year, currently at over 50,000 paying students. The money will be used to get more students into its universe of tools, as well as help Novakid expand into international markets with high populations of speakers who want to learn English.</p>
<p>The company’s suite of services are built around two principles: First, that it can immerse early-age learners into the world of English at scale, and second, that it can actually be fun to use.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Novakid&#8217;s ESL app for children raises $4.25M Series A led by PortfoLion and LearnStart investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/novakids-esl-app-for-children-raises-4-25m-series-a-led-by-portfolio-and-learnstart-investors/embed/#?secret=qRWEU5CA3O" data-secret="qRWEU5CA3O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When a user signs up, they are first connected to one of Novakid’s 2,000 live tutors for their first class. Tutors must be native English speakers with a B.A. degree or higher, as well as an international teaching certificate such as DELTA, CELTA, TESOL or TEFL.</p>
<p>“One of the things that is really important, even psychologically, is to start listening to the language, start interacting with a live person, and remove being afraid of not understanding something,” Azarov said. The company wants to recreate the conditions of how a kid likely learned their first language.</p>
<p>In the class, the tutors only speak English, and users are encouraged to do the same to slowly build and mistake their way into confidence. While the live, video-based classes are a key part of Novakid’s product, Azarov said it was important that his company “was not just giving you access to a teacher” as its main value proposition.</p>
<p>“Most of the competitors are taking teachers and making them available remotely so you don&#8217;t have to travel and you have a bigger selection,” he said. But if you look at the industry in the bigger picture, guys like Oxford, Cambridge, Pearson who provide content for the language learning industry, their product basically sucks. It’s really bad.” So, Novakid puts most of its energy into rebuilding a curriculum that works with better design, and includes games.</p>
<p>Gamified content lives both in and out of classes. Within the classroom, a teacher may take a student on a VR-enhanced tour through famous landmarks and museums to practice vocabulary. Self-paced content could look like a multiplayer “battle” between two students answering questions within a certain time period to get a better score. Novakid has an entire team dedicated to game design and development.</p>
<p>Students are clicking in. Novakid users spend two-thirds of their time on the website with tutors, and one-third with self-paced content that the company built in-house. The company wants to switch those concentrations because more students are spending time with the asynchronous content around grammar and vocabulary, and teachers are reserved for more complex information like speaking and conversation.</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of scaling up a language learning business is that users need to stay motivated. Gamification helps with engagement, but Novakid’s clientele of children could also be fast to churn compared to adult learners, simply due to priorities. Azarov said that he sees how some would view selling exclusively to children as a disadvantage, but he views their focus as differentiation.</p>
<p>“You get better brand equity when you’re more focused,” he said. “The way kids learn language is vastly different from the way adults learn language, and I don’t think the general players who do ‘everything from everybody’ will be able to do [the former] as well as we are.” Duolingo recently launched <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/abc">Duolingo ABC</a>, a free English literacy app with hundreds of short-form exercises. While the now-public company has strong branding, Novakid&#8217;s strategy differs by adding in more services around live learning and speaking.</p>
<p>So far, the company has proven that its strategy is sticking. Its revenue in 2020 was $9 million, and in 2021 it is expected to hit between $36 million to $45 million in revenue. It declined to disclose the specifics around diversity of the team, but plans to kick off a quite intensive recruiting spree going forward. Azarov plans to add 200 people to his 300-person company in the next six months.</p>

But to turn passive searchers into active shoppers, your ads should answer their question and entice them to click.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested thousands of paid search ads at <a href="https://www.demandcurve.com/">Demand Curve</a> and through our agency <a href="https://www.bellcurve.com/">Bell Curve</a>. This post breaks down 14 questions your paid search ads should answer to ensure you&#8217;re only paying for the highest-intent shoppers.</p>
<h2>Question 1: &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221;</h2>
<p>An important distinction between paid search and organic search is that paid ads are an interruption. Users of search engines are simply looking for an answer to their question. The people who see your ads don&#8217;t owe you anything. Just because you&#8217;re paying to have your ad show up first doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>To generate genuine interest in your paid ads, reframe your offer as a favor.</p>
<p>You can do this in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the features of your product as the solution to your customers&#8217; problem.</li>
<li>Emphasize the outcome your customer seeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, reframing free delivery as an extra convenience makes the offer that much more attractive.</p>
<p>Use ad extensions by listing additional benefits in the description of the page. For example, including &#8220;customized plans&#8221; in the pricing extension page signals to your customer that they&#8217;ll have control over the cost. This will help to attract the curiosity of even the most cost-conscious buyers.</p>

<h2>Question 2: &#8220;Why should I buy now?&#8221;</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of e-commerce shopping carts are abandoned, mostly because shoppers don&#8217;t feel any urgency to complete the transaction. Online shoppers aren&#8217;t in any rush, as the internet is open 24/7 and inventory feels unlimited.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Use ad copy that bridges the gap between their problem and your solution. The easiest way to create that curiosity bridge is by asking a question.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To answer the question, &#8220;Why should I buy now?&#8221;, you&#8217;re going to have to create an incentive to get them to take action now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiss alternative protein company Planted has raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/swiss-maker-of-meat-alternatives-planted-will-expand-and-diversify-with-18m-series-a/">second</a> round of the year, a CHF 19 million (about $21 million at present) &#8220;pre-B&#8221; fundraise that will help it continue its growth and debut new products. A U.S. launch is in the cards eventually, but for now Planted&#8217;s exclusively European customers will be able to give its new veggie schnitzel a shot.</p>
<p>Planted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/planted-joins-the-meatless-meat-melee-with-its-pea-protein-chicken/">appeared in 2019</a> as a spinoff from Swiss research university ETH Zurich, where the founders developed the original technique of extruding plant proteins and water into fibrous structures similar to real meat&#8217;s. Since then the company has diversified its protein sources, adding oat and sunflower to the mix, and developed pulled pork and kebab alternative products as well.</p>
<p>Over time the process has improved as well. &#8220;We added fermentation/biotech technologies to enhance taste and texture,&#8221; wrote CEO and co-founder Christoph Jenny in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;Meaning 1) we can create structures without form limitation and 2) can add a broader taste profile.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest advance is schnitzel, which is of course a breaded and fried piece of pounded-thin meat style popular around the world, but especially in the company&#8217;s core markets of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Jenny noted that Planted&#8217;s schnitzel is produced as one piece, not pressed together from smaller bits. &#8220;The taste and texture benefit from fermentation approach, that makes the flavor profile mouth watering and the texture super juicy,&#8221; he said, though of course we will have to test it to be sure. Expect schnitzel to debut in Q3.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first of several planned &#8220;whole&#8221; or &#8220;prime&#8221; cuts, larger pieces that can be prepared like any other piece of meat — the team says their products require no special preparation or additives and can be dropped in as 1:1 replacements in most recipes. Right now the big cuts are leaving the lab and entering consumer testing for taste tuning and eventually scaling.</p>
<p>The funding round came from &#8220;Vorwerk Ventures, Gullspång Re:food, Movendo Capital, Good Seed Ventures, Joyance, ACE &amp; Company (SFG strategy) and Be8 Ventures,&#8221; and was described as a follow-on to March&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/swiss-maker-of-meat-alternatives-planted-will-expand-and-diversify-with-18m-series-a/">CHF 17M series A</a>. No doubt the exploding demand for alternative proteins and growing competition in the space has spurred Planted&#8217;s investors to opt for more aggressive growth and development strategies.</p>
<p>The company plans to enter several new markets over Q3 and Q4, but the U.S. is still a question mark due to COVID-19 restrictions on travel. Jenny said they are preparing so that they can make that move whenever it becomes possible, but for now Planted is focused on the European market.</p>
<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: This article originally misstated the new round as also being CHF 17M &#8212; entirely my mistake. This has been corrected.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mgathermalstorage.com/">MGA Thermal</a> wants to help utility companies transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources with shoebox-sized thermal energy storage blocks. The company says a stack of 1,000 blocks is about the size of a small car and can store enough energy to power 27 homes for 24 hours. This gives utility providers the ability to store large amounts of energy and have it ready to dispatch even when weather conditions aren’t ideal for generating solar or wind power. The modular blocks also make it easier to convert infrastructure, like coal-fired power plants, into grid-scale energy storage.</p>
<p>MGA Thermal announced today it has raised $8 million AUD (about $5.9 million USD), bring its total funding so far to $9 million AUD. The round was led by Main Sequence, a venture firm founded by Australia’s national science agency that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/founded-by-australias-national-science-agency-main-sequence-launches-250m-aud-deep-tech-fund/">recently launched a new $250 million AUD fund</a>. Alberts Impact Capital, New Zealand’s Climate Venture Capital Fund, The Melt and returning investor CP Ventures participated, along with angel investors like Chris Sang, Emlyn Scott and Glenn Butcher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Based in Newcastle, Australia, MGA Thermal was founded in April 2019 by Erich Kisi and Alexander Post after nearly a decade spent researching and developing miscibility gap alloys technology at the University of Newcastle. When asked to explain MGA tech in layperson’s terms, Kisi used a delicious analogy.</p>
<p>MGA Thermal’s blocks “essentially comprise metal particles that melt when heated embedded in an inert matrix material. Think of a block as being like a choc-chip muffin heated in a microwave. The muffin consists of a cake component, which holds everything in shape when heated, and the choc chips, which melt,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“The energy that goes into melting the choc chips is stored and can burn your mouth when you bite into the muffin,” he added. “Melting energy is more intense than merely heating something up and that melting energy is concentrated near the melting temperature so energy can be released in a consistent way.”</p>

<p>Energy stored in MGA Thermal’s blocks can be used to heat water to power steam turbines and generators. In this scenario, blocks are designed with internal tubing for pumping and boiling water, or interact with a heat exchanger. Kisi said MGA Thermal’s blocks enable aging thermal power plans to continue running on renewable energy that would usually be switched off in situations like overheating caused by too much sun or high winds.</p>
<p>Other thermal energy solutions include heating low-cost solid materials in blocks or granules to high temperatures in an insulated container. But many of these materials aren’t good at moving thermal energy around and have temperature limitations, Kisi said. This means thermal energy decreases in temperature as it is discharged, making it less effective.</p>
<p>Another method for storing thermal energy involves molten salts that are heated by a renewable energy source and stored in a hot tank. The hot salt is then pumped through a heat exchanger to make steam, while colder (but still molten) salt is returned to a “cold” tank.</p>
<p>“These systems are widely used in concentrating solar thermal energy but have found little use elsewhere,” Kisi said. “That’s mostly because there is a large infrastructure cost for piping pumps and heaters, and a large amount of power is wasted keeping the salt from freezing.”</p>
<p>MGA Thermal is establishing a manufacturing plant in New South Wales to scale to commercial levels production of its blocks, and plans to double its team over the next 12 months so it can make hundreds of thousands of blocks each month. It is also currently working with partners like Swiss company E2S Power ASG and U.S.-based Peregrine Turbine Technologies to deploy its tech in Australia, Europe and North America. For example, E2S Power AG will use MGA Thermal’s tech to repurpose retired and active coal-fired thermal plants in Europe.</p>
<p>While MGA Thermal’s tech has many industrial use cases, like converting power stations, building off-grid storage and supplying power to remote communities and commercial spaces, it can also help consumers consume less fossil fuel. For example, MGA blocks can be used by households to store excess energy generated from rooftop solar panels or small wind turbines. Then that energy can be used to heat homes.</p>
<p>“Around the world an estimated three billion people heat their homes by burning fuel,” said Kisi. “That’s a lot of CO2, especially in very cold climates.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Main Sequence partner Martin Duursma said, “A core focus of our new fund is uncovering the scientific discoveries, and helping to turn them into real, tangible technologies so we can reverse our climate impact. Erich Kisi and Alexander Post’s impressive deep research backgrounds, their expert team and innovative technology are paving the way for grid-scale energy storage and boosting the capability of a renewable energy future globally.”</p>

<p>The retail and cloud giant says its palm scanning hardware &#8220;captures the minute characteristics of your palm — both surface-area details like lines and ridges as well as subcutaneous features such as vein patterns — to create your palm signature,&#8221; which is then stored in the cloud and used to confirm your identity when you&#8217;re in one of its stores.</p>

(Image: Amazon)</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s Amazon doing with this data exactly? Your palm print on its own might not do much — though Amazon <a href="https://one.amazon.com/how-it-works">says</a> it uses an unspecified &#8220;subset&#8221; of anonymous palm data to improve the technology. But by linking it to your Amazon account, Amazon can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/amazon-expands-its-biometric-based-amazon-one-palm-reader-system-to-more-retail-stores/">use the data</a> it collects, like shopping history, to target ads, offers and recommendations to you over time.</p>
<p>Amazon also says it stores palm data indefinitely, unless you choose to delete the data once there are no outstanding transactions left, or if you don&#8217;t use the feature for two years.</p>
<p>While the idea of contactlessly scanning your palm print to pay for goods during a pandemic might seem like a novel idea, it&#8217;s one to be met with caution and skepticism given Amazon&#8217;s past efforts in developing biometric technology. Amazon&#8217;s controversial facial recognition technology, which it historically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/lawmakers-amazon-recognition-racially-biased-harm-free-expression/">sold to police and law enforcement</a>, was the subject of lawsuits that allege the company violated state laws that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/">bar the use of personal biometric data</a> without permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dystopian future of science fiction is now. It’s horrifying that Amazon is asking people to sell their bodies, but it’s even worse that people are doing it for such a low price,&#8221; said Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the New York-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in an email to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biometric data is one of the only ways that companies and governments can track us permanently. You can change your name, you can change your Social Security number, but you can’t change your palm print. The more we normalize these tactics, the harder they will be to escape. If we don’t [draw a] line in the sand here, I am very fearful what our future will look like,&#8221; said Cahn.</p>
<p>When reached, an Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology predicts that U.S. companies will spend upward of $100 billion on AI R&amp;D per year by 2025. Much of this spending today is done by <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Mapping-U.S.-Multinationals-Global-AI-RD-Activity-1.pdf">six tech companies</a> — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, Facebook and Apple, according to a recent study from CSET at Georgetown University. But what if you’re a startup whose product relies on AI at its core?</p>
<p>Can early-stage companies support a research-based workflow? At a startup or scaleup, the focus is often more on concrete product development than research. For obvious reasons, companies want to make things that matter to their customers, investors and stakeholders. Ideally, there’s a way to do both.</p>
<p>Before investing in staffing an AI research lab, consider this advice to determine whether you’re ready to get started.</p>
<h2>Compile the right research team</h2>
<p>Assuming it’s your organization’s priority to do innovative AI research, the first step is to hire one or two researchers. At Unbabel, we did this early by hiring Ph.D.s and getting started quickly with research for a product that hadn’t been developed yet. Some researchers will build from scratch and others will take your data and try to find a pre-existing model that fits your needs.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While Google’s X division may have the capital to focus on moonshots, most startups can only invest in innovation that provides them a competitive advantage or improves their product.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>From there, you’ll need to hire research engineers or machine learning operations professionals. Research is only a small part of using AI in production. Research engineers will then release your research into production, monitor your model’s results and refine the model if it stops predicting well (or otherwise is not operating as planned). Often they’ll use automation to simplify monitoring and deployment procedures as opposed to doing everything manually.</p>
<p>None of this falls within the scope of a research scientist — they’re most used to working with the data sets and models in training. That said, researchers and engineers will need to work together in a continuous feedback loop to refine and retrain models based on actual performance in inference.</p>
<h2>Choose the problems you want to solve</h2>
<p>The CSET research cited above shows that 85% of AI labs in North America and Europe do some form of basic AI research, and less than 15% focus on development. The rest of the world is different: A majority of labs in other countries, such as India and Israel, focus on development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google just dumped a whole bunch of news about its upcoming Pixel 6 smartphone. Maybe the company was looking to get out in front of August 11’s big Samsung event &#8212; or perhaps it’s just hoping to keep people interested in the months leading up to a big fall announcement (and beat additional leaks to the punch).</p>
<p>In either case, we got the <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/">first look at the upcoming Android smartphone</a>, including a fairly massive redesign of the camera system on the rear. The company has traded its square configuration for a big, black bar that appears to indicate an even larger push into upgraded hardware after a couple of generations spent insisting that software/AI are the grounds on which it has chosen to fight.</p>

<p>More interesting, however, is the arrival of Tensor, a new custom SoC (system on a chip) that will debut on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. It’s an important step from the company, as it looks to differentiate itself in a crowded smartphone field &#8212; something the company has admittedly struggled with in the past.</p>
<p>That means moving away from Qualcomm chips on these higher-end systems, following in Apple’s path of creating custom silicon. That said, the chips will be based on the same ARM architecture that Qualcomm uses to create its otherwise ubiquitous Snapdragon chips, and Google <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-tensor-pixel-6-pro/">will still rely</a> on the San Diego company to supply components for its budget-minded A Series.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184612" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=680,282 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pixel-6.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The Tensor name is a clear homage to Google’s TensorFlow ML, which has driven a number of its projects. And unsurprisingly, the company sites AI/ML as foundational to the chip’s place in the forthcoming phones. The Pixel team has long pushed software-based solutions, such as computational photography, as a differentiator.</p>
<p>“The team that designed our silicon wanted to make Pixel even more capable. For example, with Tensor we thought about every piece of the chip and customized it to run Google&#8217;s computational photography models,” Google writes. “For users, this means entirely new features, plus improvements to existing ones.”</p>
<p>Beyond the upgraded camera system, Tensor will be central to improving things such as speech recognition and language learning. Details are understandably still thin (the full reveal is happening in the fall, mind), but today’s announcement seems geared toward laying out what the future looks like for a revamped Pixel team &#8212; and certainly these sorts of focuses play into precisely what Google ought to be doing in the smartphone space: focusing on its smarts in AI and software.</p>
<p>In May of last year, key members of the Pixel team left Google, pointing to what looked to be a transition for the team. Hardware head Rick Osterloh was reported to have had harsh words at the time.</p>
<p>“AI is the future of our innovation work, but the problem is we’ve run into computing limitations that prevented us from fully pursuing our mission,” Osterloh wrote in today’s post. “So we set about building a technology platform built for mobile that enabled us to bring our most innovative AI and machine learning (ML) to our Pixel users.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last couple of years, robotic process automation or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">RPA has been red hot with tons of investor activity</a> and M&amp;A from companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/">SAP</a>, IBM and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">ServiceNow</a>. UIPath <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">had a major IPO in April</a> and has a market cap over $30 billion. I wondered when Salesforce would get involved and today the company dipped its toe into the RPA pool, <a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/news/mulesoft-to-acquire-servicetrace/">announcing its intent</a> to buy German RPA company Servicetrace.</p>
<p>Salesforce intends to make Servicetrace part of Mulesoft, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">it bought in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>. The companies aren&#8217;t divulging the purchase price, suggesting it&#8217;s a much smaller deal. When Servicetrace is in the fold, it should fit in well with Mulesoft&#8217;s API integration, helping to add an automation layer to Mulesoft&#8217;s tool kit.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the addition of Servicetrace, MuleSoft will be able to deliver a leading unified integration, API management and RPA platform, which will further enrich the Salesforce Customer 360 — empowering organizations to deliver connected experiences from anywhere. The new RPA capabilities will enhance Salesforce’s Einstein Automate solution, enabling end-to-end workflow automation across any system for service, sales, industries, and more,&#8221; Mulesoft CEO Brent Hayward wrote<a href="https://blogs.mulesoft.com/news/mulesoft-to-acquire-servicetrace/"> in a blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BTaUjRrR7e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">No code, workflow and RPA line up for their automation moment</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No code, workflow and RPA line up for their automation moment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/embed/#?secret=BTaUjRrR7e" data-secret="BTaUjRrR7e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Einstein, Salesforce&#8217;s artificial intelligence layer, gives companies with more modern tooling the ability to automate certain tasks, RPA is suited to more legacy operations, and this acquisition could be another step in helping Salesforce bridge the gap between older on-prem tools and more modern cloud software.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that it brings another dimension to Salesforce&#8217;s digital transformation tools. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t take Salesforce long to move to the next acquisition after closing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">their biggest purchase with Slack</a>. But automation of processes and workflows fueled by real-time data coming from a growing variety of sources is becoming a key to finding success with digital transformation. And this adds a critical piece to that puzzle for Salesforce/MuleSoft,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While it feels like Salesforce is joining the market late, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/5-investors-discuss-the-future-of-rpa-after-uipaths-ipo/">in an investor survey we published in May,</a> Laela Sturdy, general partner at CapitalG, told us that we are just skimming the surface so far when it comes to RPA&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re a long way from needing to think about the space maturing. In fact, RPA adoption is still in its early infancy when you consider its immense potential. Most companies are only now just beginning to explore the numerous use cases that exist across industries. The more enterprises dip their toes into RPA, the more use cases they envision,&#8221; Sturdy responded in the survey.</p>
<p>Servicetrace was founded in 2004, long before the notion of RPA even existed. Neither Crunchbase nor PitchBook shows any money raised, but the website suggests a mature company with a rich product set. Customers include Fujitsu, Siemens, Merck and Deutsche Telekom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luxury, technology and a whole lot of flash often go hand in hand. In the age of space-faring billionaires, we all expect the latest wiz-bang gadget to look like something from the future, right?</p>
<p>Not in Audi&#8217;s view. The 2022 Audi e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT are a pair of all-electric grand touring halo cars that don&#8217;t look like something from 2060. They look just like sleek gasoline-powered GTs, but beneath the skin, there&#8217;s a whole lot more power, technological pop and panache than the design implies at first glance.</p>
<p>The 2022 Audi e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT get a low-slung roofline, wide track and long wheelbase like those grand tourers of the past, with the addition of a few design flourishes to bring it in line with Audi&#8217;s subtle, yet luxurious aesthetic. While the e-tron GT and the RS e-tron GT were both produced alongside the Audi R8 (its roofline is lower than the R8) and borrow a few things from that iconic design, these electric grand tourers are a pair of beasts all their own.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Based on the same 800-volt architecture as the Porsche Taycan, the e-tron GT makes 469 combined horsepower (up to 522 hp with overboost) from a pair of dual, permanent-magnet motors powering the front and rear wheels. The RS e-tron GT makes 590 (637 hp with overboost) horsepower from those same motors and Audi says it can do 0-60 in 3.1 seconds.</p>
<p>Both vehicles are capable, confident and quick and don&#8217;t tarry on mountain roads or long highway stretches. Acceleration is almost seamless, as it is in most electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Thanks to Audi&#8217;s electric quattro all-wheel drive with torque vectoring system, both vehicles are sure-footed and well sorted, even when the wheels start to squeal. This system allows a variable amount of power to be sent to wheels that slip when cornering hard, making a sudden lane change, or driving in slippery conditions.</p>
<p>The vehicles I drove were outfitted with summer tires, and I got to test a bit of this out on a closed slalom course with a sudden lane change at the end at the Agua Dulce Airpark about 50 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. I ran the RS e-tron GT through the cones three consecutive times to get a feel for the system and each time the car felt secure, planted and under control.</p>
<h2>Steering, speed and range</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2184599" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184599" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2184599 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg" alt="Audi RS e-tron GT Tango Red_03" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_03.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2184599" class="wp-caption-text">2022 Audi RS e-tron GT. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>Both the e-tron GT and the RS e-tron GT also get optional rear-wheel steering. Under 30 mph, the rear wheels can turn up to 2.8 degrees in the opposite direction to the front wheels to help make the turning radius of the e-tron GT and the RS e-tron GT smaller. Above 30 mph the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front. This system is similar (with fewer degrees of rotation) to that in the Porsche Taycan.</p>
<p>While I did not get to try out overboost in either vehicle on the smooth tarmac at the airpark, I did run a series of back-to-back 0 to 100 mph accelerations using launch control in the RS e-tron GT. Amongst the cohort of journalists there, I came in second, doing 0-60 in 3.24 seconds and 0-100 in 7.29 seconds. In 102-degree heat, on cold tires, those numbers are plenty impressive. By the end of the runway, I saw speeds approaching 120 mph, 32 mph short of the electronically limited 155 mph, (152 mph in the e-tron GT) before hitting the brakes. After three back-to-back runs, the fully charged RS e-tron GT had only lost 20 miles of range.</p>
<p>The EPA-estimated range for the RS e-tron GT is 232 miles while the e-tron GT is estimated to get 239 miles of range.</p>
<h2>Charging up</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2184603" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184603" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2184603 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg" alt="2022 Audi e-tron GT Ascari Blue_54" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_54.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2184603" class="wp-caption-text">2022 Audi e-tron GT. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>Those estimated EPA ranges are a result of the low-slung 93 kWh battery pack (the same in both vehicles) that Audi says can charge up to 80% in 23 minutes on 270-volt chargers (DC fast charging).</p>
<p>The e-tron GT starts at $99,900 and the RS e-tron GT pops to a higher $139,900 (both excluding the $1,045 destination charge). That price tag does come with one-time limited benefit.</p>
<p>Audi paired up with Electrify America to offer free, unlimited public charging for three years (without time restrictions). They also offer at-home charging stations set up through Qmerit. Both the e-tron GT and the RS e-tron GT come with standard dual charging ports and a 9.6 kW charging system with 240-volt capability so that owners can charge anywhere. Electrify America was launched by the Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, following the Dieselgate scandal.</p>
<p>Finding any charger is available through the infotainment system, known as the MMI, and the 10.1-inch touchscreen in the center console. Head to navigation and then hit the icon marked with a plug and a list of chargers near you will populate.</p>
<p>While I didn&#8217;t get the opportunity to try to find chargers on the one-day drive, Audi says that finding EA chargers and their status and availability is easy through both Audi&#8217;s MyAudi app (available via smartphone and desktop), and through the MMI.  Audi says that drivers can sort by their preferred charging level (Level 1 through DC fast chargers) and navigate to the charger all without leaving Audi&#8217;s in-vehicle interface.</p>
<p>Drivers can also perform the search on their phone through EA&#8217;s app or through the MyAudi app and send directions to the car either via wireless CarPlay, which is currently available or wireless Android Auto, which is coming on production models, though it wasn&#8217;t available in the e-tron GT or the RS e-tron GT that I drove. Drivers can also connect their smartphone through a USB-C port located in the center armrest.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get to try the MyAudi app since I am not an owner (it requires tying the vehicle&#8217;s VIN to the app to ensure that privacy is maintained), but Audi says that drivers can plan a route on their MyAudi app, and the system will automatically include charge stops along the way to ensure that they arrive with plenty of battery in reserve.</p>
<p>For those luxury buyers who want a bit more support to make a seamless transition to an all-electric luxury car, Audi is launching what they call Audi Care for EVs with the e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT. At participating dealers, owners can pay an additional $999 plus tax to get vehicle servicing for four years that includes high-wear items like wipers and brake pads, available valet pick-up and drop-off for service appointments, mobile service (tire changes, basic maintenance) and, if an owner needs it, up to 10 free tows to an Audi center per year. Audi is also offering seven free days of rentals from Audi by Silvercar with the purchase of an e-tron GT or a RS e-tron.</p>
<h2>That virtual cockpit, though</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2184595" style="width: 6610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184595" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2184595 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg" alt="Audi-e-tron GT Ascari Blue" width="6600" height="4402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg 6600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/e-tron-GT-Ascari-Blue_74.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6600px) 100vw, 6600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2184595" class="wp-caption-text">2022 Audi e-tron GT. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The e-tron GT and the RS e-tron GT blend features from both the e-tron (the SUV) and the Audi R8, and both GTs get dual screens that offer tons of features for drivers and passengers. The 12.3-inch virtual cockpit in front of the driver is highly customizable, like it is on most modern Audis today, offering everything from map views to battery status access with few simple inputs on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>The system makes navigating a breeze and drivers or passengers can use voice control to set destinations by simply pressing the button on the steering wheel and giving the car an address, point of interest or city.</p>
<p>The voice system is surprisingly robust and while it was a bit laggy when I used it, it recognizes natural language inputs and verbally prompts the speaker to use specific terms when choosing between two options &#8212; say canceling a route and putting in a new destination versus making a stopover. Never once did I have to try multiple times to get the system to recognize what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch infotainment system in the center console offers everything from drive mode selection to specific Audi apps, navigation options, optional massage, heat and cooled seats, and much more.</p>
<p>The Audi MMI center screen is touch capacitive and users can drag and drop icons around, allowing owners and their passengers to customize the home screen in any way. The seat heater, cooler and the massage can all be run at the same time, should someone so desire (and have the right equipment), all from the MMI.</p>
<h2>Maybe just a little flash?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2184604" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184604" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2184604 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg" alt="2022 Audi RS e-tron GT Tango Red_23" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RS-e-tron-GT-Tango-Red_23.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2184604" class="wp-caption-text">2022 Audi RS e-tron GT. I<strong>mage Credits:</strong> Audi</p></div></p>
<p>Both GTs are pushing $100,000, and for that, some buyers may want just a little bit more razzle dazzle.</p>
<p>For the launch year, Audi is offering one pricey, but special option on the RS e-tron GT: the Year One package. For $20,350, owners get the &#8220;carbon performance&#8221; package with features like carbon-fiber trim, illuminated door sills, black badges and rear-wheel steering, along with special 21-inch wheels, red ceramic brake calipers, red seatbelts and red stitching inside.</p>
<p>For those who want the prestige, power and advanced technology of a luxury brand, in an electric halo grand tourer that doesn&#8217;t (necessarily) come with all the flash, the 2022 Audi e-tron GT and Audi RS e-tron GT fit the bill. Both are on sale now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the company isn&#8217;t revealing everything about it just yet, this morning Google gave the world its first official peek at its next flagship phone: the Pixel 6.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what we know so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll come in two forms: Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.</li>
<li>The base 6 will have a matte aluminum finish <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml">with a 6.4&#8243; display</a>, while the Pro has a shinier polished aluminum finish with a 6.7&#8243; display.</li>
<li>Pixel 6 has two cameras (wide and ultrawide), while the 6 Pro adds a telephoto zoom lens.</li>
<li>If you were hoping the increasingly common &#8220;camera bump&#8221; trend was on the way out … not quite. The bump has now evolved into the &#8220;camera bar,&#8221; with Google&#8217;s Rick Osterloh noting that better sensors and lenses just won&#8217;t fit in a smaller package.</li>
<li>These will be the first phones to run Tensor, Google&#8217;s first entirely custom system on a chip. Previous Pixels have run on Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon platform. Google CEO Sundar Pichai says <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai">they&#8217;ve been working on the chip for four+ years</a>. In a blog post <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/">announcing the devices</a>, Osterloh suggests that the focus here is making a chip tuned for on-device AI and ML.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ll ship sometime &#8220;this fall.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lots of details, including pricing and much of the spec sheet (CPU, RAM, etc.) are still a mystery for now — though <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/07/08/exclusive-full-final-specifications-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/">earlier leaks</a> seem to be spot on, so far.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The creators of Pokémon GO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">Niantic</a>, developed one of the first mainstream augmented reality games, boasting <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/pokemon-go-statistics/">166 million users and over a billion dollars in revenue</a> last year. Taking inspiration from the main series Pokémon games, Pokémon GO uses in-game incentives to encourage users to explore their surroundings, team up with other users to fight legendary beasts, and travel to places they&#8217;ve never been before.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, this posed an accessibility issue &#8212; when certain tasks could only be completed by walking a certain distance, for example, it alienated users with physical conditions and disabilities that prevent them from easily taking a walk around the neighborhood. Plus, for players in wheelchairs, it might be impossible to access certain PokéStops and Gyms. It&#8217;s necessary to interact with these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/what-is-ingress-prime/">real-world landmarks</a> to play the game to its fullest.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Niantic evolved Pokémon GO for the year no one could go anywhere&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/embed/#?secret=xxk2pbomGL" data-secret="xxk2pbomGL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When much of the world entered lockdown March 2020, Pokémon Go doubled the size of the radius that players can be within to interact with a PokéStop or Gym, widening the radius from 40 meters to 80 meters. So, you could now be farther away from a landmark but still reap its rewards. This made it easier for users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/niantic-is-updating-pokemon-go-and-other-titles-to-support-indoor-gaming/">play from home</a> or play outside while social distancing &#8212; but it also made the game much more accessible. Plus, for a game that still gets a bad rep for causing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pokemon-go-linked-to-traffic-deaths-accidents-and-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-in-vehicular-damage-2017-11">traffic accidents</a>, the increased radius helped pedestrian players access landmarks without brazenly jaywalking across the street (to be fair, it&#8217;s on users to make smart decisions while gaming in augmented reality &#8212; but, Niantic has responsibility here too). And for businesses that happened to be located in a prime location for raid battles, which require players to gather in person within a Gym&#8217;s radius to defeat rare monsters, this meant that Pokémon players could maintain a respectful distance from storefronts while playing the game (later in the pandemic, it became possible to join raid battles remotely &#8212; this feature will remain in the game, probably because it proved profitable).</p>
<p>These pandemic incentives were always framed as <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/gyminteractionupdate-20200331/?hl=en">temporary bonuses</a>, but players embraced the changes &#8212; in 2020, Pokémon GO had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">its highest-earning year yet</a>. Now, the increased landmark radius has been removed &#8220;<a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/hello-world-pokemon-go">as a test</a>&#8221; in the U.S. and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we return to the outside world again, these changes are aimed at restoring the focus of Pokémon GO on movement and exploration in the real world,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/hello-world-pokemon-go">a blog post</a>. &#8220;These changes will be introduced slowly and carefully to make it more exciting to explore the world around you.&#8221;</p>
<p>One new incentive gives users 10x XP for visiting a new PokéStop for the first time (or, in real-world terms, visiting a new place). But as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/cdc-mask-guidance-vaccinated-people-bn/index.html">delta variant spreads</a> in the U.S., players find these changes to be frustrating and misguided. Why roll back features that made the game more accessible while also netting the company more money?</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The removal of double distance is nothing short of a slap in the face towards the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonGO</a> Community.</p>
<p>I’ll realistic and say I that I’ll quit GO if changes aren’t being made ASAP.</p>

<p>The Pokémon GO YouTuber, Reversal, who has created sponsored content for Niantic, wrote that he will quit the game if changes aren&#8217;t made ASAP. Other players launched <a href="https://www.change.org/p/niantic-keep-increased-pokestop-and-gym-interaction-distance">a petition</a> with over 130,000 signatures to keep increased PokéStop and Gym interaction distance. Prominent Pokémon GO content creators like <a href="https://youtu.be/tGqg1qYKKGI?t=120">ZoëTwoDots</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpG8asGli4c">The Trainer Club</a> have referenced a potential boycott of the game in videos they uploaded today, citing Niantic&#8217;s refusal to listen to community concerns after they announced the <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/hello-world-pokemon-go">impending end</a> of pandemic bonuses in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than down to boycott the game with everyone if we&#8217;re vibing that,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-10uJUkzxSXa9sEtV67YcA">ZoëTwoDots</a>, who has also partnered with Niantic, told her 212,000 subscribers. &#8220;I know for myself personally, I&#8217;m just straight up not spending money in the game going forward until they address it publicly.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My opinion on the Pokéstop radius hasn&#39;t changed. It was a clear quality of life change that was only fully realised because of a (ongoing) pandemic.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As the game celebrates its five-year anniversary, the conflict it now faces isn&#8217;t about players wishing for the game to be easier. Rather, this represents a failure by Niantic to listen to its user base, prioritize accessibility and incentivize users to stay home as COVID-19 cases <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">rise again</a> in the U.S.</p>

This agreement sets two of the most admired financial technology companies in recent history on a path to becoming one.</p>
<p>Afterpay and Square have the potential to build one of the world’s most important payments networks. Square has built a very significant merchant payment network, and, via Cash App, a thriving high-growth consumer payment service. However, these two lines of business have historically not been integrated. Together, Square and Afterpay will be able to weave all of these services together into a single integrated experience.</p>
<p>Afterpay and Cash App each have double-digit millions of consumers, and Square’s seller ecosystem and Afterpay’s merchant network both record double-digit billions of payment volume per year. From the offline register and the online checkout flow to sending money in just a few taps, Square and Afterpay will tell a complete story of next-generation economic empowerment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Afterpay’s only institutional venture investor, I wanted to share some perspective on how we got here and what this merger means for the future of consumer finance and the payments industry.</p>

<h2>Critical innovations in fintech</h2>
<p>Every five to 10 years, the global payments industry undergoes a critical innovation cycle that determines the winners and losers for the next several decades. The last major transition was the shift to NFC-based mobile payments, which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/31/the-first-battle-in-the-mobile-payments-war-is-over/">wrote about in 2015</a>. The major mobile OS vendors (Apple and Google) cemented their position in the global payments stack by deftly bridging the needs of the networks (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) and consumers by way of the mobile devices in their pockets.</p>
<p>Afterpay sparked the latest critical innovation cycle. Conceived in a living room in Sydney by a millennial, Nick Molnar, for millennials, Afterpay had a key insight: Millennials don’t like credit.</p>
<p>Millennials came of age during the global mortgage crisis of 2008. As young adults, they watched their friends and family lose their homes by overextending on mortgage debt, bolstering their already lower trust for banks. They also have record levels of student debt. Therefore, it’s no surprise that millennials (and Gen Z right behind them) strongly prefer debit cards over credit cards.</p>
<p>But it’s one thing to recognize the paradigm shift and quite another to do something about it. Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen did something, ultimately building one of the fastest-growing payments startups in history on their core product: Buy now, pay later … and never any interest.</p>
<p>Afterpay’s product is simple. If you have $100 in your cart and choose to pay with Afterpay, it will charge your bank card (typically a debit card) $25 every two weeks in four installments. No interest, no revolving debt and no fees with on-time payments. For the millennial consumer, this meant they could get the primary benefit of a credit card (the ability to pay later) with their debit card, without the need to worry about all the bad things that come with credit cards — high interest rates and revolving debt.</p>
<p>All upside, no downside. Who could resist? For the early merchants, virtually all of whom relied on millennials as their key growth segment, they got a fair trade: Pay a small fee above payment processing to Afterpay, get significantly higher average order values and conversions to purchase. It was a win-win proposition and, with lots of execution, a new payment network was born.</p>

<h2>Imitation is the greatest form of flattery</h2>
<p>Afterpay went somewhat unnoticed outside Australia in 2016 and 2017, but once it came to the U.S. in 2018 and built a business there that broke $100 million net revenues in only its second year, it got attention.</p>
<p>Klarna, which had struggled with product-market fit in the U.S., pivoted their business to emulate Afterpay. And Affirm, which had always been about traditional credit — generating a significant portion of their revenue from consumer interest — also noticed and introduced their own BNPL offering. Then came PayPal with “Pay in 4,” and just a few weeks ago, there has been news that Apple is expected to enter the space.</p>
<p>Afterpay created a global phenomenon that has now become a category embraced by mainstream players across the industry — a category that is on track to take a meaningful share of global retail payments over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Afterpay stands apart. It has always been the BNPL leader by virtually every measure, and it has done it by staying true to their customers&#8217; needs. The company is great at understanding the millennial and Gen Z consumer. It’s evident in the voice, tone and lifestyle brand you experience as an Afterpay user, and in the merchant network it continues to build strategically. It&#8217;s also evident in the simple fact that it doesn’t try to cross-sell users revolving debt products.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it&#8217;s evident in the usage metrics relative to competition. This is a product that people love, use and have come to rely on, all with better, fairer terms than were ever available to them than with traditional consumer credit.</p>

<h2>Square + Afterpay: The perfect fit</h2>
<p>I’ve been building payment companies for over 15 years now, initially in the early days of PayPal and more recently as a venture investor at Matrix Partners. I’ve never seen a combination that has such potential to deliver extraordinary value to consumers and merchants. Even more so than eBay + PayPal.</p>
<p>Beyond the clear product and network complementarity, what’s most exciting to me and my partners is the alignment of values and culture. Square and Afterpay share a vision of a future with more opportunity and fewer economic hurdles for all. As they build toward that future together, I’m confident that this combination is a winner. Square and Afterpay together will become the world’s next generation payment provider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German electric aircraft startup Lilium is negotiating the terms for a 220-aircraft, $1 billion order with one of Brazil’s largest domestic airlines, the companies said Monday. Should the deal with Azul move forward, it would mark the largest order in Lilium’s history and its first foray into South American markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;A term sheet has been signed and we will move toward a final agreement in the coming months,&#8221; a Lilium spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The 220 aircraft would fly as part of a new, co-branded airline network that would operate in Brazil. Should the two companies come to an agreement, Azul would operate and maintain the fleet of the flagship seven-seater aircraft, and Lilium would provide custom spare parts, including replacement batteries, and an aircraft health monitoring platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Deliveries would commence in 2025, a year after Lilium has said it plans to begin commercial operations in Europe and the United States. These timelines are dependent upon Lilium receiving key certification approvals from each country’s requisite aerospace regulator. Azul said in a statement it would “support Lilium with the necessary regulatory approval processes in Brazil” as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Even if a deal is reached, it would likely be subject to Lilium hitting certain performance standards and benchmarks, similar to the conditions of Archer Aviation’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">$1 billion order</a> with United Airlines. Still, orders of this value are seen as a positive signal to markets and investors that an electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft is more than smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>Also like Archer, Lilium is planning on taking the SPAC route to going public. The company in March announced its intention to merge with Qell Acquisition Corp. and list on Nasdaq under ticker symbol “LILM.” SPACs have become a popular vehicle for public listing across the transportation sector, but they’ve become especially popular with capital-intensive eVTOL startups.</p>
<p>The merger may be necessary for the company’s continued operations. According to the German news website Welt, Lilium added a risk warning to its 2019 balance sheet noting that it will run out of money in December 2022 should the SPAC merger not be completed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s often said in baseball that a prospect has a high ceiling, reflecting the tremendous potential of a young player with plenty of room to get better. The same could be said for the cloud infrastructure market, which just keeps growing, with little sign of slowing down any time soon. The market hit $42 billion in total revenue with all major vendors reporting, up $2 billion from Q1.</p>
<p>Synergy Research <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/quarterly-cloud-market-leaps-to-42b-amazon-microsoft-google-pocket-63-of-dollars-spent">reports that the revenue grew</a> at a speedy 39% clip, the fourth consecutive quarter that it has increased. AWS led the way per usual, but Microsoft continued growing at a rapid pace and Google also kept the momentum going.</p>
<p>AWS continues to defy market logic, actually increasing growth by 5% over the previous quarter at 37%, an amazing feat for a company with the market maturity of AWS. That accounted for $14.81 billion in revenue for Amazon&#8217;s cloud division, putting it close to a $60 billion run rate, good for a market leading 33% share. While that share has remained fairly steady for a number of years, the revenue continues to grow as the market pie grows ever larger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft grew even faster at 51%, and while Microsoft cloud infrastructure data isn&#8217;t always easy to nail down, with 20% of market share according to Synergy Research, that puts it at $8.4 billion as it continues to push upward with revenue up from $7.8 billion last quarter.</p>
<p>Google too continued its slow and steady progress under the leadership of Thomas Kurian, leading the growth numbers with a 54% increase in cloud revenue in Q2 on revenue of $4.2 billion, good for 10% market share, the first time Google Cloud has reached double figures in Synergy&#8217;s quarterly tracking data. That&#8217;s up from $3.5 billion last quarter.</p>

<p>After the Big 3, Alibaba held steady over Q1 at 6% (but will only report this week), with IBM falling a point from Q1 to 4% as Big Blue continues to struggle in pure infrastructure as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">it makes the transition to more of a hybrid cloud management player</a>.</p>
<p>John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy, says that the Big 3 are spending big to help fuel this growth. &#8220;Amazon, Microsoft and Google in aggregate are typically investing over $25 billion in capex per quarter, much of which is going towards building and equipping their fleet of over 340 hyperscale data centers,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-services-q2-2021">Canalys had similar numbers</a>, but saw the overall market slightly higher at $47 billion. Their market share broke down to Amazon with 31%, Microsoft with 22% and Google with 8% of that total number.</p>
<p>Canalys analyst Blake Murray says that part of the reason companies are shifting workloads to the cloud is to help achieve environmental sustainability goals as the cloud vendors are working toward using more renewable energy to run their massive data centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best practices and technology utilized by these companies will filter to the rest of the industry, while customers will increasingly use cloud services to relieve some of their environmental responsibilities and meet sustainability goals,&#8221; Murray said in a statement.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether companies are moving to the cloud to get out of the data center business or because they hope to piggyback on the sustainability efforts of the Big 3, companies are continuing a steady march to the cloud. With some estimates of worldwide cloud usage at around 25%, the potential for continued growth remains strong, especially with many markets still untapped outside the U.S.</p>
<p>That bodes well for the Big 3 and for other smaller operators who can find a way to tap into slices of market share that add up to big revenue. &#8220;There remains a wealth of opportunity for smaller, more focused cloud providers, but it can be hard to look away from the eye-popping numbers coming out of the Big 3,&#8221; Dinsdale said.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s hard to see the ceiling for these companies any time in the foreseeable future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors should be key considerations for CTOs and technology leaders scaling next generation companies from day one. Investors are increasingly prioritizing startups that focus on ESG, with the growth of <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/investment-ideas/sustainable-investing">sustainable investing</a> skyrocketing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s driving this shift in mentality across every industry? It’s simple: Consumers are no longer willing to support companies that don’t prioritize sustainability. According to a <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-04-22-IBM-Study-COVID-19-Pandemic-Impacted-9-in-10-Surveyed-Consumers-Views-on-Sustainability">survey</a> conducted by IBM, the COVID-19 pandemic has elevated consumers&#8217; focus on sustainability and their willingness to pay out of their own pockets for a sustainable future. In tandem, federal action on climate change is increasing, with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/paris-climate-agreement/">U.S. rejoining</a> the Paris Climate Agreement and a recent executive order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/">climate commitments</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have seen an uptick in organizations setting long-term sustainability goals. However, CEOs and chief sustainability officers typically forecast these goals, and they are often long term and aspirational — leaving the near and midterm implementation of ESG programs to operations and technology teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Until recently, choosing cloud regions meant considering factors like cost and latency to end users. But carbon is another factor worth considering.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>CTOs are a crucial part of the planning process, and in fact, can be the secret weapon to help their organization supercharge their ESG targets. Below are a few immediate steps that CTOs and technology leaders can take to achieve sustainability and make an ethical impact.</p>
<h2>Reducing environmental impact</h2>
<p>As more businesses digitize and more consumers use devices and cloud services, the energy needed by data centers continues to rise. In fact, data centers account for an <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6481/984">estimated</a> 1% of worldwide electricity usage. However, a forecast from <a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2021/03/16/green-cloud.aspx">IDC</a> shows that the continued adoption of cloud computing could prevent the emission of more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2021 through 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Make compute workloads more efficient</strong>: First, it’s important to understand the links between computing, power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Making your app and compute workloads more efficient will reduce costs and energy requirements, thus reducing the carbon footprint of those workloads. In the cloud, tools like compute instance auto scaling and sizing recommendations make sure you’re not running too many or overprovisioned cloud VMs based on demand. You can also move to serverless computing, which does much of this scaling work automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Deploy compute workloads in regions with lower carbon intensity</strong>: Until recently, choosing cloud regions meant considering factors like cost and latency to end users. But carbon is another factor worth considering. While the compute capabilities of regions are similar, their carbon intensities typically vary. Some regions have access to more carbon-free energy production than others, and consequently the carbon intensity for each region is different.</p>
<p>So, choosing a cloud region with lower carbon intensity is often the simplest and most impactful step you can take. Alistair Scott, co-founder and CTO of cloud infrastructure startup <a href="https://www.infracost.io/">Infracost</a>, underscores this sentiment: &#8220;Engineers want to do the right thing and reduce waste, and I think cloud providers can help with that. The key is to provide information in workflow, so the people who are responsible for infraprovisioning can weigh the CO2 impact versus other factors such as cost and data residency before they deploy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another step is to estimate your specific workload’s carbon footprint using open-source software like <a href="https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/">Cloud Carbon Footprint</a>, a project sponsored by ThoughtWorks. Etsy has open-sourced a similar tool called <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2020/04/23/cloud-jewels-estimating-kwh-in-the-cloud/">Cloud Jewels</a> that estimates energy consumption based on cloud usage information. This is helping them track progress toward their target of reducing their energy intensity by 25% by 2025.</p>
<h2>Make social impact</h2>
<p>Beyond reducing environmental impact, CTOs and technology leaders can have significant, direct and meaningful social impact.</p>
<p><strong>Include societal benefits in the design of your products</strong>: As a CTO or technology founder, you can help ensure that societal benefits are prioritized in your product roadmaps. For example, if you’re a fintech CTO, you can add product features to expand access to credit in underserved populations. Startups like <a href="https://startup.google.com/stories/loanwell/">LoanWell</a> are on a mission to increase access to capital for those typically left out of the financial system and make the loan origination process more efficient and equitable.</p>
<p>When thinking about product design, a product needs to be as useful and effective as it is sustainable. By thinking about sustainability and societal impact as a core element of product innovation, there is an opportunity to differentiate yourself in socially beneficial ways. For example, Lush has been a pioneer of package-free solutions, and launched Lush Lens — a virtual package app leveraging cameras on mobile phones and AI to overlay product information. The company hit <a href="https://weare.lush.com/press-releases/lush-lens-hits-2-million-scans/">2 million scans</a> in its efforts to tackle the beauty industry’s excessive use of (plastic) packaging.</p>
<p><strong>Responsible AI practices should be ingrained in the culture to avoid social harms</strong>: Machine learning and artificial intelligence have become central to the advanced, personalized digital experiences everyone is accustomed to — from product and content recommendations to spam filtering, trend forecasting and other “smart” behaviors.</p>
<p>It is therefore critical to incorporate responsible AI practices, so benefits from AI and ML can be realized by your entire user base and that inadvertent harm can be avoided. Start by establishing clear principles for working with AI responsibly, and translate those principles into processes and procedures. Think about AI responsibility reviews the same way you think about code reviews, automated testing and UX design. As a technical leader or founder, you get to establish what the process is.</p>
<h2>Impact governance</h2>
<p>Promoting governance does not stop with the board and CEO; CTOs play an important role, too.</p>
<p><strong>Create a diverse and inclusive technology team</strong>: Compared to individual decision-makers, diverse teams make better decisions <a href="https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/experts/research/diversity-drives-better-decisions">87% of the time</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/workforce-diversity#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20finds%20that%20in,intent%20to%20stay%20by%2020%25.&amp;text=This%20research%20details%20seven%20key,results%20from%20diversity%20and%20inclusion.">Gartner research</a> found that in a diverse workforce, performance improves by 12% and intent to stay by 20%.</p>
<p>It is important to reinforce and demonstrate why diversity, equity and inclusion is important within a technology team. One way you can do this is by using data to inform your DEI efforts. You can establish a voluntary internal program to collect demographics, including gender, race and ethnicity, and this data will provide a baseline for identifying diversity gaps and measuring improvements. Consider going further by baking these improvements into your employee performance process, such as objectives and key results (OKRs). Make everyone accountable from the start, not just HR.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the ways CTOs and technology leaders can contribute to ESG progress in their companies. The first step, however, is to recognize the many ways you as a technology leader can make an impact from day one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hello-sunshine.com/">Hello Sunshine,</a> Reese Witherspoon&#8217;s media company that has produced content for streaming services like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/hulu-outbids-rivals-for-little-fires-everywhere-from-reese-witherspoon-and-kerry-washington/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/apple-greenlights-new-reese-witherspoon-backed-comedy-series-starring-kristen-wiig/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)">HBO</a>, among others, has been sold to a yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs, Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005519/en/Hello-Sunshine-Announces-Majority-Investment-from-Newly-Formed-Next-Generation-Media-Company-Backed-by-Kevin-Mayer-Tom-Staggs-and-Blackstone">announced</a> this morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-to-be-sold-to-media-company-backed-by-blackstone-11627914600">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported on the sale.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not officially disclosed, but reportedly, the sale values Hello Sunshine&#8217;s business at around $900 million, The WSJ says. The news outlet had previously <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reese-witherspoons-media-company-hello-sunshine-is-exploring-a-sale-11625605587">reported</a> Hello Sunshine was exploring a sale after receiving interest from a number of suitors, including Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hello Sunshine was co-founded by Witherspoon and Strand Equity founder and managing partner Seth Rodsky in 2016, and is best known for producing series like HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Big Little Lies,&#8221; Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere&#8221; and Apple&#8217;s &#8220;The Morning Show,&#8221; which feature Witherspoon in starring roles.</p>
<p>But the company has also invested in other film and media projects, ranging from a <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/05/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-meet-my-mom-facebook-watch-1202387374/">Facebook Watch series</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-to-debut-an-exclusive-lineup-of-audible-originals/">collaborations</a> with Amazon&#8217;s Audible. It now has upcoming film and TV projects on the slate with Netflix, Amazon, ABC and Starz, and recently announced a Kids &amp; Animation division as well as the acquisition of Sara Rea&#8217;s SKR Production to expand into unscripted content.</p>
<p>In addition, the company operates an online and mobile book club app, <a href="https://reesesbookclub.com/">Reese&#8217;s Book Club</a>, now with 2.1 million followers. The club&#8217;s more popular picks are often turned into the shows and movies Hello Sunshine later produces.</p>
<p>Per Hello Sunshine&#8217;s announcement, the company will be the first acquisition by the new media venture run by Mayer and Staggs, which is backed by private equity firm Blackstone. The firm is spending more than $500 million in cash to purchase shares of Hello Sunshine from its investors, including AT&amp;T and Emerson Collective, The WSJ noted.</p>
<p>Following the deal&#8217;s closure, the senior management team will continue to run Hello Sunshine&#8217;s day-to-day operations. Witherspoon and Hello Sunshine Chief Executive Sarah Harden will join the board of the new company and retain significant equity holders in the new business.</p>
<p>Hello Sunshine will become a cornerstone of the new media company&#8217;s strategy, which will involve being an &#8220;independent, creator-friendly home for cutting-edge, high-quality, category-defining brands and franchises,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks a tremendous moment for Hello Sunshine. I started this company to change the way all women are seen in media. Over the past few years, we have watched our mission thrive through books, TV, film and social platforms. Today, we’re taking a huge step forward by partnering with Blackstone, which will enable us to tell even more entertaining, impactful and illuminating stories about women’s lives globally. I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for our future,&#8221; said Witherspoon in a statement about the deal.</p>
<p>The deal arrives at a time when there&#8217;s an uptick in consolidation happening in the media business, as companies adjust to the shift away from traditional TV and standard movie releases to the always-on world of streaming and cord cutting. For example, Amazon in May <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">announced</a> it would buy MGM Studios for $8.45 billion &#8212; a deal being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">investigated</a> by the FTC for potential antitrust issues. Meanwhile, WarnerMedia and Discovery around the same time <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">announced</a> their plans to merge operations, in hopes of taking a bigger bite out of the streaming market. Now, Comcast and ViacomCBS are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">exploring</a> ways to work together, too.</p>

<p>But as traditional media companies begin to stream, like NBCU did with Peacock, for instance, they also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/nielsen-says-the-office-was-the-most-popular-streaming-series-of-2020/"> pull back content</a> licensed to other streamers, like Netflix. That drives demand for new sources of independent programming, like what Hello Sunshine produces.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s value in this market comes from its pipeline of quality projects, many of which are pre-vetted by its book club members, who serve as a built-in audience and fan base for the later film or televised release. Plus, the projects it backs are also those that tell women&#8217;s stories &#8212; a historically neglected segment of the market, and one that Hello Sunshine&#8217;s success proves there&#8217;s pent-up demand for among viewers.</p>
<p>Blackstone&#8217;s investment in the new company is being made through its private equity business, which previously acquired a majority stake in dating app Bumble.
